McENERNEY
WANTS TRUTH
UNHAMPERED
; SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., July 10, 1900
MY name is Robert Colthorp. I reside at 455 Jessie street. I am going on 51 years of
age. I am married. I. came to San Francisco on October 3, 1875. I know John
M. Chretien. I have known him for the past twenty years. For the past two years
I have been working for John M. Chretien by cleaning up his office. I know him very
well. I wrote the name "John Sullivan" on the paper which you now show to me. (Mr. Lloyd
shows Mr. Colthorp a paper indorsed substantially: "Deed. John Sullivan to J. J. Rauer. Re
corded in Book of Deeds, Vol. 1868, page 198, May 5, 1900, 2:02 p. m., at the request of J. J.
Rauer," and bearing the signature "John Sullivan.") I wrote the name "John Sullivan" on that
paper at Mr. Chretien's request. I wrote it in Mr. Chretien's office, in room 20 of the building
230 Montgomery street, in the city and county of San Francisco. I do not remember what
Chretien said to me at the time. He only asked me to write the name "John Sullivan" on the
paper. At the time I signed the name "John Sullivan" on the paper there was no one present
but Chretien and I.
j I know Lee D. Craig, the Notary Public, but I have never been before him to acknowl
} edge any paper. I never acknowledged any deed before Lee D. Craig. I never made a dsed
in my life. I do not remember

â¢ When I signed, the check was lying on the counter in the little office. Chretien did not fur
i nish me the pen and ink with which to sign. The pen and ink were already on the counter.
Â» I signed the name "John Sullivan" on the check in the presence of Mr. Chretien and Profes
, sor Dutchy. I do not know that Chretien asked me to take a drink. He just laid down the
check and asked me to sign the name of "John Sullivan" on it. Chretien did not say any
thing to me about writing two L's in the name "Sullivan." After I had signed the name
' "John Sullivan" on the check, Mr. Chretien took the check. I have signed names to other
1 papers for Mr. Chretien, but I don't remember now what the papers were.
When I signed the name "John Sullivan" on the paper you -showed^ to me (the deed) I
i did not know what kind of a paper it was. It was folded up, and, I did not see anything but
, the place where I signed the name "John Sullivan."
the decree of distribution should berome final
and valid. It would be the proper course anl
th* rarer course to g!ve notice that the decree
would be ?et aside this morning unless good
cause was shown why it should not be set
aside; then, if need be, a decree of distribution
may cone latÂ»r.
The Decree Set Aside.
I will now formally set aside this decree of
distribution for the purpose of thoroughly in
vestigating this matter and determining
whether or net the man who swore he was Ihe
brother of this decedent is such a person. If
there has been any wrorig-d'-ins: here or any
attempt at wrong-doing ihs hope is and it will
bÂ» the enrnfrit effort of the court to determlr.a
who is the wrongdoer, and, of course, the pun
ishment will be inflicted for the purpose Â«jf
teaching- a lessor, to these who may in the fu
ture feel disposed to try to impose upon tha
co'jrt.
JI r. Lloyd â I will suggest that that be put
in the shape of a written order on the grounj
that thpre has been an attempt to commit
fraud upon this court. UnJer those circum
stances the court has the power to do this.
Mr. Ruef â I was about to makf the motion
myself to have this decree set aside, not upon
the ground of frau.l, because that would b? pre
judging the matter, which I think would be
unfair and would also give the newspaper a
chance to say that it ha<! forced the court to
f>ay that something wrong had been done. But
I desire on the part of the administrator of the
estate and so far as It is in the power of the
administrator and of myself, to move that OM
decree be set aside for the purpose of furthtâ
Investigation upon the ground that it was in
advertently entered, upon testimony which was
not at the time sufficiently inquired into uml-r
the circumstances now disclosed. It does not
makÂ« any difference what the ground of the
motion is. the court has the rower to set the
decree aside and we consent that it should be
done for the purpose of further investigation.
Mr. McEnerneyâ I think, with Mr. Uuef, that
the decree should be set aside, not upon the
ground of fraud, because it han not been
proved, but It should be set ash"* in order that
we might proceed to see whether any fraud
has been committed or not. The questions in
volved here are of infinitely greater magnitude
than the ownership of a $3100 estate.
The Courtâ I desire to say that all Informa
tion at any time concerning any proceedings
In this department, whether obtained from the
pres3 or from any person or persons, wilt al
ways be welcome, no matter what disagreeable'
shape tt may come in. I feel appreciative of
the Information that has DeÂ«n received here
to give me an opportunity to Investigate and
to save thla estate until It Is determined who
is the rishtful heir or the proper party in in-
Mr. Ruefâ I ask your Honor to let tt appear
that the motion was made by us for that pur
pose or that It U made by the consent of all
parties.
The Courtâ The court has suggested it. I ap
preciate, of course, your position la the mat
ter.
J Qh P M. Chretien was the first witness
called to the stand. Mr. McEnerney con
ducted the examination.
In Search of an Heir.
\-nder McEnerney's questions Chretien
told hov.% as soon as he was appointed
attorney for the absent heirs of the dead
SuIUvan, he proceeded to look for same.
He did not know that Sullivan had any
heirs, but he went to Sullivan's landlady
en Post street and she sent him to a tai
lor on Kearny street and he sent him
to a farmer in Evergreen, whose hired
man sent him to a deaf old woman who
told him Sullivan had a brother in Eng
land- In his affidavit of services Chretien
paid he went to Evergreen to see the old
woman, Mrs. Lafferty, he called her, and
in his testimony he said he went to see
Martin Murphy, to whom the tailor on
Kearny street had referred him. Later
on he said Mrs. Lafferty had told him
Ihe address was 34 Soho square, and still
later he tcok this back and said Charle3
Weston told him in a letter from Ens
land. How Charles Weston knew Chre
tien could not tell. Â¦
Then Chretien went to the office of
Drinkhouse, who was Public Administra
tor at ;hat time, and from his clerk, Sam
H. Eeckett. he heard again that there
was a Sullivan in Soho square. Beckett
said he got his information from Sulli
van's landlady, which \v-a3 more than
Chretien had done.
Then, acting on this Information. Chre
tien wrote to Soho square. He had not
then the address of 34, and his letter was
addressed' Just Soho square. It was re
turned to him with the Information that
no Sullivan was known at 31. 37. 1, 3 or 3
Soho square. With the return of this let
ter ends all that Is reasonable about
Chretien's story.
Then Chretien said he inquired of an
English friend, a man named Rollat, and
at his suggestion he sent a letter to the
firm of Freer, Reeve, Hunt & Rowlatt
of London, but he received no reply and
his letter was never returned. Then he
sent two more letters to an address on
Wharton street, he said, one on September
IS and one on October 23. How he secured
the Wharton street address was an In
teresting illustration of how Chretien did
business.
McEnerney started after the "Wharton
street address as soon as he heard It- Ho
asked:
The Hand of Mr. Weatherly.
How did you get any Information about Su!
llvan's addrÂ»sa being at 26 Wharton street?
From a gentleman here In tbe city.
Who? Dr. "Weatherly.
Where Is his place of business? I couldn't
tell you. I met him one day on the street and
I asked him.
Is he a physician? "Well, he was a phy-
CHRETIEN'S TOOL CONFESSES IN JAILâ POLICE SURROUND THE LAWYER'S HOUSE-HE WILL
BE ESCORTED TO COURT THIS MORNING BY DETECTIVES.
A THUNDERBOLT has fallen in the camp of the probate conspirators
who mack- the court of Judge James M. Troutt the field of their
operations for the robbery of the unprotected and intestate dead.
When The Call made its serious charges that an estate of a dead man
in this city had been robbed through a systematic, deliberate and long-con
tined j-iGt it knew whereof it spoke. When the expose was made the con
spirators raised a storm of indignation and made a pretense of denial in or
der thai their tracks might be covered and that their shameless schemes
might go unpunished. To accomplish their purpose they demanded an in
vestigation, and yesterday their request was granted by Judge Troutt.
The result is that John M. Chretien, the notorious and odious schemer
who has disgraced the profession of which he is a member and who his
preyed upon the community in which he had been permitted to exist, will
be arrested this morning on a serious charge. His house was surrounded
last night and unt:! this morning, by orders of Chief of Detectives John
Seymour. Detectives Dinan, Wren. Crockett and Dillon guarded the resi
dence, in order that the- unscrupulous attorney might not escape. One of
his tools, a negro employed by him, who had testified in court during the
day. had subsequently confessed the entire shameful scheme which The Call
exposed. This negro, an ignorant fellow, had been induced by his scoundrel
employer to sign the name of John Sullivan to a receipt acknowledging that
the estate of a dead man had parsed into the possession of its rightful heir.
This astounding confession, which substantiates the allegations of the Call,
prompted the Police Department of this city to take immediate measures
to punish the man who had committed an atrocious crime.
These steps were taken none too soon, as Chretien had already made every
preparation to lice. His belongings were packed and he intended to leave
this city at tbe earliest opportunity for the Orient. The detectives guarded
the house during the night, and this morning they will escort John M. Chre
tien to the Probate Court, where, after he has given any testimony that may
be asked of him. he will be arrested and charged with the serious offense
of which the officials believe him to be guilty;
When The Ca!i instituted this investigation it had but one purpose in
view. It believed that a ring of scoundrels was committing the most atro
cious crime against the community â the robbery of the unprotected dead.
This paper submitted the facts in it? possession and the proofs at its dis
posal. It had no motive but to protect the community from the predatory
acts of thieves. It desired to punish no one who did not deserve punishment,
and when Judge Troutt decided that it was his duty to investigate the ac
cusations and the proofs which The Call presented, this paper was sincerely
gratified at this resuit of its labors.
When the court convened yesterday morning and Reuben H. Lloyd, who
had volunteered his services tne day before in behalf of the court, in order
that the dignity of his profession should not be unjustly assailed nor the
sanctity of the court of which he is an officer be violated, made a demand for
a complete investigation, he had the support of every decent citizen in the
community. Judge Troutt immediately ordered- the investigation, and yes
terday it began. Mr. Lloyd declared that he had made a close inquiry into
the affairs of the scandalous case in which the probate conspirators were con
cerned, and said that he had found many matters which deserved serious in
vestigation. He asked, therefore, that other attorneys be associated with him.
He said that attorneys owed it to themselves, to the community whose
confidence they enjoy and to the courts in which they practice, to probe this
matter to the bottom. He called, therefore, upon the court to appoint men
to be associated with him, and he begged of the many attorneys in the court
room to respond to his appeal. Realizing the momentous character of the
proceeding. Judge Troutt was critical in his choice. He took care that rep
resentative men of the legal profession should act, if they would. He asked
Garret W. McEnerney if he would accept the responsibility, and the attorney
replied that he would. He called upon E. F. Preston to accept the same
duty, and Mr. Preston likewise responded. These three men. admittedly
representative of their profession in this city, then began their investigation.
The results of that investigation in court are published this morning in The
Call.
The Judge and the lawyers admitted that the affair is of primary and
serious interest to the entire community, involving as it does matters which
touch everj' citizen most closely. The examination was therefore absolutely
thorough. What conclusion Judge Troutt may reach from it is his affair,
which at this time it would be improper for The Call to discuss. This paper
repeats, however, that a scandalous conspiracy of lawyers and their tools was
formed in this city to rob the estate of a dead man. That conspiracy was
successful. A bogus heir was presented to the court, an estate was awarded
to him and probate sharks feasted on the spoils. Forgery and perjury were
committed in Judge Troutt's court. These were the original allegations of
this paper, and this morning they are repeated.
During the examination yesterday, John M. Chretien was on the wit
ness stand for the major portion of the day. His colored employe
was also put upon the witness stand and was made to sign the name of
John Sullivan. As far as a layman's eye can perceive, the signature which
this man wrote in court is the same which was written to a receipt signed
by John Sullivan, the heir of Joseph Sullivan, admitting- that- he had re
ceived from the Public Administrator, through his attorney, Abraham Ruef,
the estate of his brother in full. After this negro had finished his testimony,
he was placed under' arrest by Chief of Detectives John F. Seymour and
taken to the office of the Chief of Police.
During the examination of the colored man and of Chretien, District
Attorney Lewis F. Byington. representatives of the Grand Jury, Chief of De
tectives Seymour and many of the most prominent members of the legal
profession in this city had heard the startling declarations made in court.
These declarations were sufficient to warrant Reuben H. Lloyd, Garret W
McEnerney, District Attorney Lewis F. Byington and Chief of Detectives
John F. Seymour in questioning the negro thoroughly after his arrest. The
result was that the unfortunate man confessed that at the instigation of John
M. Chretien, and in the presence of Fred Hansted, who is known to
unenviable notoriety as Young Dutchy, he signed the name of John Sullivan
to the receipt for the estate and to other documents in the case.
Upon this evidence, in conjunction with the startling revelations which
had been made in the court, the police officials decided to place John M.
Chretien under arrest. They had information that he intended to flee from
the Stcte, and for that reason they guarded his house. These startling de
velopments, which seem to be a shocking climax to a disgraceful affair, do
not tell the entire story. John M. Chretien is not the only scoundrel con
cerned in the theft of the estate of the intestate dead. Others are involved
ss deeply and as criminally as he, and their culpability will be established
before the investigation reaches its conclusion.
LLOYD FOUND
TRACES OF A
PLAIN FRAUD
BEING a mere looker-on yes
terday In this court and sec-
Ing from the proceedings
that were had that there
might be a miscarriage cf justice,
and ecnerlvir.fr it my duty as a
member of the bar to make a sug
gestion to your Honor to protect
the court and the heirs and the
parties interested in this estate by
setting aside the decree, it seems
I have got myw-lf Into trouble by
your Honor appointing me to rep
resent the court. I made a cur
sory examination of the affairs
and transactions of this estate as
rapidly and as fully a? I could at
the time, and 1 flnd there are many
things vhioh should be carefully
lnv<-.stig:ated. I think the court
should appoint po:ne other mem
ber of the bar. All lawyers should
cheerfully give their time to
pee that Justice is properly admin
istered in court, and therefore I do
not think any lawyer will object
to rendering his services to assist
the court so far as he can In this
matter.â From Attorney Reuben
II. Lloyd's remarks In court.
THERE was never a more sensa
tional trial In the Superior courts
of this city than that, before Judge
Troutt yesterday. There have been
trials more sensational perhaps in
the facts they were based upon, but no
trial has ever started upon a single charge
and then as the day wore on developed
evidence of such a cold-blooded and infa
mous plot.
The witnesses examined were not many,
but the testimony that searching ques
tions wrung from them made up for any
lack of number in a lavish store of facts.
The heirs advanced. to claim the miser
able hundreds of Joseph Sullivan were
ranged before the public as a procession
of myths, and then from that they devel
oped Into frauds. Â¦
John Chretien was on the stand all the
morning and much of the afternoon, and
the story he told would make reading for
a school of crime. His testimony amount
ed to thisâ that he took the man Sullivan,
tthc heir to a dead man's estate, without
knowing more about him than that he
bore a bit of paper which Chretien said
he had written to him, and then when
Chretien was asked to produce the letter
that served to Identify this willing heir
he could not or would not produce it. In
the afternoon he changed his affidavit or i
services until it fitted testimony plven in
an ill guarded moment In the" morning
lie forgot names and dates until he saw
others knew them, and then they sprang
into his mind with a nimbleness that. was
surprising. He explained - and then
changed his explanations; he made asser
tions and counter-assertions, and h<j piled
Mr. Lloydâ I notice also another distinguished
member of the bar here in courtâ Mr. Preston.
I think he could render able assistance in this
matter, and I suggest that he be added to our
number.
The Court â I should appreciate it most sin
cerely' If Colonel Preston would also assist the
court In investigating this very serious mat
ter. Yesterday morning, after matter* had
progressed to ' a certain extent the court was
satisfied that, owing to! the suggestion of one
of the daily journals, the matter had been
taken In time and we are In a position to pre
serve the estate so that no manâ If any man
has attempted to foist himself upon this court
as a brother and heir to the decedent â no such
man will obtain any portion of the estate. It
may be that a Very heinous crime has been at
tempted; an attempt has been ma.1t; perhaps to
steal the property of this estate. 1 The estate
is fcere In the possession of the administrator
fortunately and it is not too late to set aside
the decree. I understood yesterday, there be
ing time to arrange for the disposition of this
matter and for a thorough Investigation before
The letter to 34 Soho square took up
much of the attention of the court and. the
attorneys. Searching inquiry was made
regarding tho place, but it remained for
Drnis Donohoe, one of the attorneys for
the British Consul, t6 tell that 34 Soho
square is the Buford Club, a private and
sf-iect club of English gentlemen, none of
whom are tailors, as John Sullivan was
described as being and of which John Sul
livan was not president. This last bit of
information was brought out by a face
tious question from ilcEnerrey.
Chretien would not even admit that he
saw "Sullivan" sign the deposition in sup
port of his claims, nor would he admit he
knew where the man lives, and as the
hours passed it was interesting to notice
that from the "John Sullivan" of the
morn'ng the references of the defending
attorneys to the bogus heir drifted around
to the "supposed heir" and the "so-called
John Sullivan."
There were other witnesses, but none of
them were such witnesses as Chrftim.
James Taylor Rogers seems to promise
something pitiable, if not interesting, but
he has not passed through half of his ex
amination so far. In fact, he had hardly
begun at the time the court's adjournment
gave him a respite.
And J. J.' Rauer was also a witness. His
testimony was all In regard to. the money
he may lose by having bought out the es
tate.
The crowd In the courtroom just before
the case opened was an interesting one.
It was made up mostly of attorneys, with
a sprinkling of newspaper men, and the
most prominent thing about it was the
bearing of the men who had handled the
estate of the dead man. Sullivan. As the
day wore on this bearing changed, and be
fore the evening adjournment to slip
quietly away was their evident desire.
When the case was called by the court
Reuben H. Lloyd arose and addressed the
Judge. He said:
Mr. Lloyd Opens Proceedings.
If. the court please, being 1 a mere looker-on
yesterday in this court and seeing from the
proceedings that were had that there might
be a miscarriage of Justice, and conceiving it
my duty as a member of the bar to make a
suggestion to your Honor 'to protect the court
and the heirs and the parties interested in this
estate by Betting aside the decree. It seems I
have got myself Into trouble by your Honor
appointing me to represent the court. I made
a cursory examination of thÂ» affairs and trans
actions of this estate, as rapidly and as fully
as I possibly coulrl at the time, and I find that
there are many things which should be care
fully investigated. That will take some time,
and I think, therefore, that the court should
appoint some other member of the bar. All
lawyers should cheerfully give their time to
see that Justice is properly administere-1 in
court, and therefore I do not think that any
lawyer will object to rendering h!s services to
assist the court so far as he can In this matter.
The Courtâ I agree with you. Mr. Lloyd. . I
observe that Mr. McEnerney is her*. Mr. Me-
Enerney, perhaps you would be willing to Join
Mr. Lloyd In this matter.
- Mr. McEnerneyâ I would be very glad to do
so. your Honor.
Mr. Ruef â I desire to have it recorded that
we cheerfully, so far as the Public Administra
tor is concerned, acquiesce, In the appointment
of Mr. McEnerney or any other attorney that
your Honor may see flt at any time to desig
nate for the Investigation of these proceedings
And another man has crept Into the
case. A convenient man from the heart
of England, one Charles Weston, who
wrote an address to Chretien Just as he
was despairing of ever finding an heir. He
was told by Weston, a friend, whose cor
respondence he has destroyed, that If he
would address 34 Soho square he would
probably find his man. He did so, and al
though the London postal authorities had
already notified Chretien that of the
three John Sullivans living in Soho not
one was the sought for man, still this time
they said nothing, but, Chretien swore,
they redirected the letter to Evergreen,
Santa Clara County California, and there
it found an owner. Once before, in an
swer to one of Chretien's letters, the Lon
don postal officials had written that there
was no John Sullivan at 34, 37, 1, 3 or 5
Soho, but still the last epistle found an
owner who turned up just in time.
Chretien was asked to produce a copy of
this last letter, but he did not do so.
He told of meeting a woman in Ever
green who gave him valuable information
of the missing heir, although she knew
nothing about the Sullivans except that
there was . "bad blood" between the
brothers, and he never asked her where
she got her Information. He struck a
man named "Weatherly on the streets of
this city and Weatherly told him all about
where he could find the missing Sullivan,
and just whom to write to, and he never
asked Weatherly If he knew either of the
brothers. He never showed the heir to
any one who could help to identify him.
and in the whole contingent that ever
had a hand in the case no one ever saw
any one to vouch for John Sullivan in
the flesh except Chretien. "When John
Sullivan wanted money from Rauer Chre
tien drew it for him. When he wanted
money from the bank Chretien was with
him. "Whenever he appears in the case he
appears through Chretien or Chretien ap
pears for him, and whenever he signed his
name a blind man would say it was
penned by the negro Colthorp.
That House in Soho Square.
I contradiction and equivocation upon con
tradiction and equivocation in an indis
criminate heap of discomfort to himself.
The climax came when his negro serv
ant was called to the stand to tell his
name and take up a pen. He tends the
door and cleans the floor of Chretien's of
iice, but he has other possibilities, as was
shown yesterday. Unless his handwriting
lies he siprns checks and powers of attor
ney and receipts for absent heirs, anrl all
for the salary of a janitor and a bellboy.
It had been shown that the "John Sulli
van" v/ho signed a power of attorney for
Chretien to act under was not the man
who signed the deposition of "John Sulli
van," the heir; and then it was shown
that Frank Colthorp, the negro and the
man who signed the power of attorney,
wrote hands that were the same. The
negro was asked his name. He gave it.
He was asked if he could write. He said
he could. He was given a pen and a. seat
at the clerk's desk, and then, while the
lawyers and the Judge peered over his
shoulder, he wrote five times the name
of John Sullivan, and any one of the five
mlsht have done duty for all the signa
tures of John Sullivan that Chretien
swears are genuine.

"Voong Dntcliy" found sleep on the bed, and Latner, his tool, fonnd whatever rest he- could In
drunken slumber on the sofa. After the conspiracy had reached successful conclusion and Latner
had been sent post haste ont of town, the leading schemers rested in false security.
Latner returned and levied blackmail npon them, and one afternoon In the saloon of Ortion Â«<fc
Gerhardt, on the southwest corner of O'Farrell and Powell streets, he, Chretien and "Yonng Dntchy"
engaged in a. wordy war over Latner's demnnds for more ' money. The money was paid. Another
ticket was purchased for the bogrns heir >' and he made his tray out of the State.' This in outline Is
the story of the part Chretien played : In ,thls shameless conspiracy. It- does not tell what others
equally as guilty as he have done against the unprotected dead.
What were you doing In there? Oh, I recol
lect exactly what we went . over there for, or
at least one of the things, to make an as
signment to a friend of his. Mr. Knox must
have a memorandum of It. for, I think, a por
tion of the money, when he should receive it-
Who did? Mr. Sullivan.
Who was the friend to whom he had made the
assignment? I don't know. It was some one
that waa with him all the time.
What was his name? I couldn't tell you.
Did you draw the assignment? No. sir; Mr.
Knox drew the assignment."
From Sullivan to somebody else? From Sul
livan to somebody else, and then I left.
Did you see him execute it? Yes, sir; I am
pretty sure.
Sullivan's Assignment.
Sullivan was sworn? I say that because I was
not there at the commencement.
. Ar.d you think that you went with Sullivan
and Keene after the deposition was taken down
to Knox's offlce in order that he might swear
Sullivanâ Is that it? Well, I know we went
there and I supposed that is what we were go
ing for.
Did you see the oath administered? I don't
know. I don't think I did.
How large a room is Knox's office? Oh. it
was not as wide as that (indicating a space
In the courtroom).
he made a number of corrections in It, and
Mr. Ruef added some more questions on cross
examination.
That Is to say. before it had been extended in
typewriting? Yes. sir.
After the deposition was completed, that Is
to say after all the questions had been put
and the answers given. Mr. Ruef's stenographer
read the deposition over to John Sullivan?
Yes. sir.
John Sullivan made some corrections In it?
Yes, sir.
Then Mr. Ruef put in some more questions?
Yes. sir.
Then did you go away, you and Sullivan?
We all went over t" Knox's office.
What for? If he signed it then, or at Knox's
office, he signed the last page; that is my Im
pression.
Was the last page typewritten before the
rest of It was typewritten? That is my Im
pression: I don't know positively. Â¦
So that you think tHat Ruef's stenographer
after he had taken down In shorthand all of
Sullivan's deposition wrote off the last page
first so that Sullivan could j sign it and go
away. Is that your testimony? ' That Is my
imrresfion.
Where were you while the typewriter in
Ruefs offlce was typewriting the last page
of his stenographic notes? I was talking to Mr.
Ruef in his office.
Is the man who signed that deposition or
who was present at the taking of the depo
sition the man who signed your power of at
torney under date of March 1. 1900? The man
that slimed that deposition to supposed to be
this man; I don't know whether it is the man
who eigned that or not,
I asked you If the man who signed your
power of attorney dated March 1. 19"0. Is the
tune Individual whose deposition was itien?
Did you see him flgn the deposition? i did
not see him sign It, because when he signed
It I was talking to Mr. Ruef; Jlr. ICeene, I
think. Â«mw him sign it.
Did U"ot See Him Sign.
The letter Sullivan is supposed to have
handpd to Chretien was the one supposed
to have bf-en written to 34 Soho square
and then rr-directed by the postal authori
ties to Evergreen. The envelope would
show that plainly, but Sullivan did not
have the envelope; he left it In Ever
preen. The letter itself would have been
valuable, but Chretien did not have it. nor
did he have a copy of It. He had nothing:
that would help him to assume a better
position before the court or to stay his
course toward absolute conviction.
Then McEnerney took up the making- of
the deposition by the pseudo Sullivan, and
his questions carried more trouble for the
witness: .
Were you present at the taking of Mr. Sul
livan's deposition on the 14th of April. 1900?
Yes. *lr.
When did you see Sullivan last? Well, I
think it was a day or two after that we went
over to Mr. Ruef's r.fficr- and tried to get a
Now, that is the last day you saw Sullivan?
Oh. no; not the fourth of May: tha.t waa the
day the decree wan cfgned.
When did Mr. Sullivan make his laat visit
to your office. Mr. Chretien? I think It was
either the day after the decree of distribution
was signed or a couple of days after that.
Mr. Ituei cculd tell that better, because he
went over to Mr. Ruefs offlce.
How many visits did he make with Senator
Goucher to your office? Quite a number of
them.
Before or after the first day of March, 1900?
After the first of March.
Did the Senator say that they were, school
boys In Ireland together, or In' the United
Kingdom? No, sir.
When did he make Senator Goucher"s ac
quaintance? That I couldn't tell you; they
appeared to be creat friends.
They were great friends? They appeared to
be: they were th're a number of times.
< Interrupting) You never wrote him a let
ter expert the one to 2i Foho square? No, sir;
he used to come around all the time. He came
around there alone until he came around with
Where riid he put up? I couldn't tell you.
Ycu drn't know where his residence was?
I No. Fir: I knew he used to come around to

Mr. (Chretien, when did you next Fee John
Full! van after the first day of March? Oh. af
ter that he stayed right along here and I saw
him constantly.
Mr. MoEnerney â I will manage the payment
of his exj>enFes. I will offer in evidence thia
power of attorney fr<-.m John' Sullivan to John
M. Chretien dated March 1. HOP, acknowledge!
thÂ» same day. before Hands W. Forman. no
tary public. It is a general power of attorney
and inf!udf-Â« the ixmer to act In his behaK
with the fullest authority "in the matu-r of
my late hrothpr's c*UHe. that is, Joseph Sulli
van, in th\ Superior Court of the city and
county of San Francisr-o. and designated as No.
"1â¬ZZ, department 10 of said Superior Court."
Saw Sullivan Constantly.
Mr. McEnerney â You got a power of attor
ney from Mr. Sullivan on the 1st of March.
DM7 I just want to make a memorandum to
telephone to Mr. Bowden at noon and ask him
if he hasÂ« got that power of attorney.
Yes. you ask Mr. Bowden to corr.p up here
and bring all the communications he has.
We 1 .:. I have got all of the communications,
l.ut I will <5o that.
Yes sir. One he executed and the other he
did not; and I think the original one that
I had sent to England is the one that is in the
han^.s of Mr. Bowden now If -he has not de
s-trcyed It.- I will communicate with him and
find out.
Mr. Ru'-'Ts father? Yes. sir, and I told him
this was Mr. Fullivan. and I waited there for
him. We expected him in at 1 o'clock and he
never came in until 6 o'clock In the evening;
of course, we did not wait that long.
The Courtâ Did John Sullivan eign two pow
ers of attorney?
Who did you see? His father.
How many times old you see him? I say
I saw him sÂ«?ver?l times and on one of the oc
casions I took him up to Mr. Ruef's offlce.
Before the first of March. 1900? Yes. sir.
Did you see Mr. Ruef on that day? No, sir.
So that you think that Mr. Bowden has the
power of attorney executed ? No, not exe
cuted Just signed, the one that I sent down.
How many times did you see John Sullivan
before the first day of March, 190")? Oh. I don't
know, two cr three times, four or five times;
I coulJn't tell you exactly. I know before he
signed the rower cf attorney that I took him
up to Mr. Ruef's office before the first of
March.
YfÂ«? The reason that the first letter was not
returned to Mr. Bowden an-i the second one
was xrzs bt-cause Mr. Sullivan received the
firFt' letter anl instead of going to Mr. Bow
den'6 orf.ee h" came up to San Francisco and
that is the reason that he did not reteive the
second letter. I did not see Mr. Sullivan for
srrne time until. I think, somewhere near the
end of the month: he had gone off somewhere
and 1 ntver Faw him at all. I think he carr.e
int<> the office either the last or the next to the
la*t day cf February and then I asked him
About the power of attorney, and he said.
Â¦â¢Why, Mr. Bowden has got it." I eald I
wanted it " "Well." he said, "can't you get
another one?" Po then I drew up another
power of attorney either the last day of Feb
ruary or the first or second or third of March.
the beginning of March, anyhow, which we
took down to the notary public. Mr. Forman,
which he acknowledged. The original power of
attorney. I jiresume. is Â£ti!l In the hands of
Mr. IJowden if he has not destroyed it. I
will corr.municate with Mr. Bowden and find
out.
letter that vou wrote to Mr. Bawden in your
letter- preys Vfk? Yes, sir.
You will bring that bock here, wlu ycu .
Yes. eir. â ,
I-lcw many letter? did you write tn Rnwden
c .n this subj*>ct? That was the only letter. I
think. New I wcul'J like to maJie an explana
tion about that.
Did you witness It? No. sir. Mr. Cognet
and Mr. Knox' witnessed It.
Did Mr. Cognet put his signature to that doc
ument? Yes. sir.
Are you sure of that? Almost positive. Yes.
I am positive.
What other papers did Mr. Sullivan sign
there besides this assignment to this friend
of his? That is all the paper that I saw him
sign.
There was method in the refusal of
Chretien to admit that he saw the depo
sition signed, for it was plain the man
who signed the deposition never signed
the power of attorney. Knox's office la
small, and whoever is there can do noth
ing without beinp seen, yet Chretien saw
no signature put to the deposition.
Then Chretien was put on. the rack to
find how he knew the John Sullivan who
came to him v;as the John Sullivan hÂ©
wanted, and twenty minutes of question
ing brought only thisâ that the letter
Chretien said he wrote to the Sullivan in
Soho square was the only evidence the
Evergreen Sullivan carried. Then he had
a lot to say of his affidavit, and with some
difficulty and much explanation rehashed
it into shape to conform to his previous
testimony. Then he remembered that
"Hadsted" was one of Sullivan"s friends,
and then McEnerney plunged Into the
middle of the conspiracy.
Mr. Chretien, what is the Christian name of
Mr. Hansted? Fred.
Kred Hansted? Yes.
Popularly known as "Dutchy" ? Professor
Young Dutchy, yes, sir.
.Do you know Charles Latner? I don't think
so: I might know him; I don't recall the name
now. I don't think I ever saw him.
Did you ever meet "Dutchy" at Ortion &
And you waited for this typewriter to finish
the last page? That is my impression now,
yes, sir.
So that this deposition never was, in its
typewritten form, read over to Sullivan? I
think it was; I think Mr. Sullivan went back
without me to Mr. Ruef's office and It was
read to him.
You don't know anything about that, do you?
Well, I don't know positively, I was simply
told so.
Who told you? Mr. Ruef and Mr. Sullivan,
both. " . â¢Â» Â¦ â¢
But you had pone to Knox's offlce and Sul
livan had signed it in Knox's office? I don't
say that: I don't know whether be signed It In
Knox's office or !n Mr. Ruef's ofice.
Well, did he sign It In Mr. Ruefs offlce? I
don't know. ,
Did he sign It at all? I suppose he did.
Do you know? I do not.
You know nothing about It? I know noth
ing about it.
Did you go from Ruef's office to Knox's of
fice? Tes, sir.
What did you go for? I accompanied him over
there and Mr. Keene.
You accompanied whom over? Mr. Sullivan.
And who else? Mr. Keene.
For what purpose did you go to Knox's of
flce? I suppose he went up there to take his
oath.
Didn't he take his oath before the questions
were put and answers given? Don't you know
that that Is always done? No; I don't think
it was.
So that you took his testamony first and
swore him afterwardâ Is that it? That I would
not say, because he was in Mr. Ruef's offlce
before I came there. I don't know what was
done before I came there.
Who was In Mr. Ruef's office? Mr. Sullivan.
Then you say that so far as you know the
testimony waa taken before Mr. Knox before
"THE CALL IS SERVING NO ULTERIOR
PURPOSE, BUT ONLY THE PUBLIC GOOD"
SWILL say in behalf of myself that I am the attorney for The Call, and The Call has no object to serve
in this investigation or in this proceeding except justice, let it fall where it may. We wish to punish no
person, we are seeking 1 nothing except that the light of truth may shine upon what we consider a trans
action which degrades the bar and casts reflections upon the bench. I think it is the duty of every lawyer
connected with the case, as it has been your Honor's pleasure and your conduct throughout this case, to
give the fullest and deepest and broadest scope to this investigation. Beyond that The Call is serving no
ulterior purpose, but only the public good.â Mr. Preston's statement in open court tcben Jamt% Taylor Rogers oh

Who went over to Mr. Knox's office? Mr.
Keene, Mr. Sullivan and myself.
And Mr.- Cognet and Mr. Knox were in Mr.
Kriox's office? Yes, sir.
Then your testimony is this, that that depo

you? I saw it completed, yesâ that is, it was

name to it? No, sir: I did not.
Ami there was nobody in that room when
that was sipned except Knox. Cogr.et, you,
Keene and Sullivan? Provided it was signed
then.
Well, do you know whether it was signed or
not? I do not; I don't know that it was signed
there, either in one place or the other.
So you are not prepared to say that you know
whether this deposition was signed there? No.
not at the moment.
You don't know but that It wan signed be
fore you went down to Knox's office? I don't
know. I don't know whether It was signed in
Mr. Ruef's office or in Mr. Knox's office, but
I know we went over to Knsx's office after
ward.
What did you go over to Mr. Knox's office
for? Well I suppose to turn over the deposition
to him. I walked over there with them.
Where waa the deposition? Mr. Keene had it.
Mr. Keene had the deposition? I never had
it in my possession at all.
What stenographer took the deposition? Mr.
Ruef's stenographer.'
You went to Mr. Ruef's office to get the dep

stenographer before you went there. You went
there for what purpose, to read it over? No,

Did you go there to hear them read it? No,

was read over by the stenographer to him, and

clerk's desk and, surrounded by eager and expectant lawyers, wrote the name of John Sullivan five times. Tha signature which he placed upon the paper was, as far as a layman ? j
could observe, identical with the signature upon a receipt which Abraham Ruef, the attorney for the -Public Administrator, accepted as the acknowledgment of the heir of Joseph f j
Sullivan that he had received his brother's estate in full. Later in the day the negro confessed to the District Attorney, the Chief of Detectives and two attorneys representing Judge t
Troutt, that he had actually signed the receipt which is in the possession/of Attorney Ruef. The shameless conspiracy which The Call exposed had been admitted.

Mr. Rogersâ If your Honor please, not desir
ing to waive any rights at this time. I want
to make three objections, aad then I will pro
ceed. If you overrule them: First, the decrea
of distribution not having bear* legally vacated,
this court has no Jurisdiction In any way as to
matters preceding that determination, and has
no power to entertain thia proceeding; second,
the court has no power herein, as no charges
against me for professional misconduct havs
been filed or served as required by law;
third, the attorneys appointed herein are the
attorneys of Tha Call and axs Interested as its
representatives.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Sow, I want to Â»ay that I
am not the attorney of Tha Call, aad that I
do not appear here in that capacity, and that
we are not now making any application for tha
disbarment of Mr. Rogers. Whether much an
application ought to bÂ« made or not will bÂ«
determined by the facts as they are developed.
It seems to me that an attorney who comes
hero In a proceeding U'*e thia ought to bÂ«
v^ry glad to irive the court the benefit of alt
cf his information, and the fact that he does
not comes in very bad taste from him.
Mr. Rogersâ He has no right to make that
anrument at thfs time.
The Courtâ That la In answer to your objec
tion.
Mr. TJoydâ I wish to say that I am not thÂ«
attorney for The Call.
Mr. McEnerneyâ We are willing to be, but
we are not. /
Mr. Prestonâ I will iÂ«y la behalf of mysÂ«Â»1f
that I am the attorney for The fall, and Tha
Call has no object to serve in this investiga
tion or in this proceeding except Justice let it
fall where It may. We wish to punUh no per
jon: we ar*> seeking nothing except that thÂ«
lisrht of truth may shine upon -what we con

and casts reflections upon the bench. I thin*
It is the duty of every lawyer connected with
Mr. McEnerneyâ Mr. Rogers, I produce from
the flies of the estate of Joseph Sullivan, de

wherein James Taylor Rogers enters his ap
pearance for Mary Ann Sulllrao. Helena Sul

nteces and nephew of the decedent. Joseph Sul

by you and bears your signature?
After Rauer came Chretien again to
acknowledge the receipt which Sullivan
had made to the Public Administrator.
It waa witnessed by Amos Collins, whom
Chretien said he saw sign the receipt, and
It was seen that Collins wrote strangely
like Chretien himself. The receipt was
acknowledged before Lee D. CraJs. tha
notary public.
Then. "What i3 the color of this man
Sullivan?" McEnerney asked suddenly.
"What do you mean?" asked Chretien,
as he looked up quickly.
"Is he a negro or a Caucasian T" de
manded McEnerney.
"He Is white." replied Chretien In a low
voice; and then he was let go for the
day.

James Taylor Rogers was the last wit

uncompleted when the court adjourned.

quiet later. Mr. McEnerney asked:
How did you pay the J6O) in addition trj

and J7oO by check. I had given them J30O In

As the negro wrote there was a d>r*d
silence in the courtroom, and as one by
one he penned the signatures, so like
those of the "heir." those around him
looked at one another as they began to
realize where the case was drifting. When
the nejrro left the stand it was plainly all
over for Chretien.
Then Jake Rauer came to tell of his
financial transactions with Chretien and
the mythical Sullivan. McEnerney asked:
Â¦What was the Erst conversation ai>out thÂ»
Sullivan estate that you had with Mr. Chre
tien. Mr. Raucr? Mr. Chretien wanted to
borrow some money and he said that thens
was such and such an estate. I told Mr.
Perry, my attorney, to go out and see Â¦whether
It was regular or not. He reported to me,
that it was and I made a loan and took an
assignment fcr JSOO on April 2S. 1S00. I never
gave anybody any money on account of th!Â»
estate before that *S0O assignment. 1 didn't
know anything about It except subsequent to
that date. I think I paid Mr. Chretien by

was after the decree was signed, on the sin
day of May.
What wa9 the transaction on that dote?
There was 11350.
All in one check? No, there was en* to
Sullivan and the other cash.
The check for 1750. payable to the order of
John Sullivan, dated May 4. 1300. waa her*
offered in evidence by Mr. McEnerney.
You gave that check on the 4th of May.
didn't you. Mr. Rauer? It was on the 4th.
the afternoon. I shall have to go on aad ex
plain that $S0O transaction. I thought I would
get It when the decree waa signed. When I
went to Mr. Ruef's office Mr. Ruef said I
had to wait sixty day*. Well, of course, ilr.
Chretien said that his client waa going away
and then I told him I would give him J13iO
and take the estate. So Mr. Ruef Insisted upon
it that the receipts should be signed by Mr.
Sullivan and acknowledged, these two receipts.

PARIS. July 10.â The Senate and Chamber of Deputies to-day concluded the debate upon the budget and were pro

character to the last, to-day's sitting being marked by one or two noisy incidents. The first of these arose over the
I supplementary list of decorations.
-*- In connection with the decorations, M. Brey, Conservative, declared that M. Millerand. the Minister of Com
merce, chose the Jurors from among his political friends. The members of the Left protested against this statement,
whereupon MJ Brey stigmatized them as "a servile majority cf the Government." An uproar ensued. M. Brev was cen
sured for his expressions by M. Deschanel. President of the Chamber.
A little later another Conservative, il. de Baudey d'Aison. indulged in unparliamentary remarks and wa3 promptly
called to order. This annoyed him and he continued a series of interruptions of the speakers who followed, until M. Des

'"You are making me tired, M. de Baudey d'Aison.'*
At these words the latter quite lost his temper and. springing up. screamed at M. Deschanel with clinched Cats.

â¢sy. however, that it is in my judement the
greatest platform adopted in recent years, if
not in the histor?- ci the co-jntry. i' iÂ« a
greater platfcrm than the Chicago platfcrm.
for It indorses the rrirK'.p!** sÂ«t forth In that

questions. There is no evasion tbout the plat

j is aa clear as the tone?! cf a bellâ as clear as
t the tones of a liberty bell. It deals honestly
with the American r-^M-ie. Its candidates are
j fledeed to its mair.ter.arice.

I know tiiat s.-rr!e of our fillies felt grieved
that they w?re not given the second place upon

unkindly toward cne who, like Mr. Stevenson,
was loya! to the ticket nominated at Chicajto

In this campaign issues are gwz'.tr than men.

War of July 7 General MacArthur
Â¦cabled the adjutant general the
following, under date of July S, 10:40 p. m.:
General MacArthur's dispatch Is inter
preted to mean that no more troops of
his command can .je withdrawn from
his force without detriment to affairs
in the Philippines. It also shows that he
was unable to send as many troop* to
China as the War Department desired.
This is shown by his statement that Tay
lor's battery of the Fourth Artillery in
Samar was not available for service in
China andj?y the further statement that

A depot of supplies will -be established
at Taku and will be provided with every
thing necessary for the maintenance of
the troops in acive field service. Includ
ing a well-stored medical supply depart
ment.
The Philippine reinforcements should
arrive at Taku by the 20th instant. The
transports used for this movement are
large freight boats, and while somewhat
slow are well adapted fcr the purpose.
They will carry supplies and stores of all
kinds sufficient for an army of 5000 men
for three months.
The additional troops ordered to the
scene from Manila, according to General
MacArthur's dispatches, will add a little
over 1000 to that force. The reinforce
ments consist of two battalions of four
companies each of the Fourteenth Infan
try, amounting to -about 900 'men, and
Captain Reilly's battery of the Fifth Ar
tillery, numbering 133 men with six guns.
The Third Battalion of the Fourteenth
Infantry is now in the United States,
posted at Fort Brady and Fort Wayne.
States forces now In China are the 1330
officers and men of the Ninth Infantry,
which, according to press dispatches, ar
rived at Taku from Manila last Saturday.

Pleads Guilty to Using the United

to Defraud.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. July 10.â Francis Truth, the
divine healer, appeared in the United
States Circuit Court this afternoon, re
tracted his plea of not guilty, plead guilty
and was fined $1500, which he paid.
His action was a preat surprise. An
agreement was entered into with the Gov
ernment. Seven indictments accusing
Truth of using the mails to further a
scheme to defraud were returned, lie
plead guilty to all of those, and on the
five charges he was fined the maximum
penalty, $500 on each.
The other two Indictments were placed
on file. Should Truth attempt In the fu
ture to engage in any unlawful business
these two Indictments will be brought up
against him and imprisonment will be Im
posed.
Judge Colt announced that these fines
were imposed at the suggestion of the
prosecuting attorney. Both sid^ claim a
victory and there is much comment on the
case. Much wonder is expressed at the
fact that he was not sentenced to Impris
onment.
Truth issued a defiant statement to
night, saying that he would at once re
sume '.'divine healing" and would proceed
against the enemies who had tried to get
him Into prison.

JAPAN'S HAND HOLDS THE
WHIP IN FAR EAST CRISIS
Work .of. the Mikado's" Government in China May
Cause Poetic Justice and Prevent Threat
ened Clash With Russia.
(Correspondence of the Associated Press.)
YOKOHAMA, June 20.â Nothing is
talked of here but the crisis In
China, and the interest in the fate
of the foreigners in Peking and
Tientsin is hourly growing more
intense. The situation is unparalleled.
Xever in history has it happened that the
representatives of all the great powers
have been shut up in the capital of the
enemy and threatened with assassination.
They were safe up to the 14th when the
last tiding were received from them, but
the momentous events of the 17th must
have immeasurably increased their peril.
It is probable that the whole foreign com
munity there, numbering between three
and four hundred, are gathered In the
British Legation grounds, which form a
large lnclosure surrounded by high walls,
and capable of being defended successful
ly against everything except artillery. :
In this year, of "reliefs" those of Peking
and Tientsin bid fair to surpass In ro
mantic and thrilling interest even those
of the- South African garrisons.
Capture of the Taku Forts.
Â¦ From the latest accounts of the bom
bardment, and capture of the Taku forts,
it seems plain that the offensive was as
sumed by. th<* Chinese. The early hour, 1
a. m., when tho first shot was fired would
seem to indicate this. The. courage of
China in thus defying the rest of the
world is universally commented upon, as
offering an extraordinary contrast to her
pusillanimity of late years. Whether, how
ever, "there is any longer a Â¦ government
there, or whether all things, are now in
the hands of the reckless Insurgents, Is
a matter of conjecture. The marvelously
easy capture of forts, pronounced by for
eign engineers to be impregnable, would
seem to indicate, the latter. The fact that
all the larger vessels of the immense for
eign fleets were obliged to remain at &
distance and out of the fight, the reduction
being accomplished entirely by the gun
boats, makes the achievement all tha
more remarkable. The attack by the land
forces consisting of a few hundred Japan
ese and Russian marines, and their easy
victory, also shows the disorganized char
acter of the defense. At last reports every
a\ailable vessel from the combined fleets
was being hurried up the river to Tien
tsin, and tidings from them art being
awaited with the intensest interest.
Mistress of the Situation.
Among the late reports Is one that the
powers have asked Japan to dispatch a
force of twenty thousand men to the
scene at once. A large transport fleet is
assembling at Ujina. the port of Hiro
shima, on the Inland Sea., and the troops
are being hurried thither, those alreadv
upon the spot embarking amid immense
enthusiasm, the scene strongly resemblintr
those attending the departure of the
forces in the late China-Japan war.
It Is now generally recognized by press
and people that this empire, by reason of
iff f 6 ? 8^? 1110 *. 1 *>Â° si " on < has the whip
hand in this extraordinary crisis and that
an opportunity is now afforded It to put

influence alike on the Government
press and the people generally. All that
has now vanished In the new national
consciousness that Japan has risen Into
supreme importance in the eyes of thÂ»
world and that she is virtually the mis
tress of the situation.
Russia Must Take a Back Seat.
It is recogmized that Russia must inevi
tably take a back seat. and. furthermore
that In whatever settlement is made in
the new apportionment the great north
ern power will be forced to unite with the
rest in according such justice to Japan as

HAY CLEARLY DEFINES
UNCLE SAM'S ATTITUDE
WASHINGTON. July l^.-The State De
partment has finally concluded to make
public; tbe identical note which was re
cently delivered to the powers as defining
the position of the United States respect
ing the Chinese* troubles. It is under
stood that this circular of instruction was
Jrawn up on the :X>th of June and trans
mitted to Canton for the approval of the
['resident and communicated to the pow
(Â¦rs concerned on the Â«<1 of July. It em
bodies the views to which this Govern
ment has strictly adhered from the very
beginning of the present troubles, and
yvhieh the powers have one by one taken
into favorable consideration. The an
nouncement of the President at the start
that we. did not consider ourselves at war
with the Chinese nation, and that all our
L-fforts should be directed toward localiz
ing: the disturbances in the province of
L'hili ;j;<l keeping them from spreading
throughout the empire by* enlisting on the
side of peace the power of the Viceroys
of Central and Southern China, has not
apparently been adopted by all the othpr
powers. It Is too soon to prophesy the
ultimate results, but thus far the Indica
tions are all favorable. It will bÂ© seen
that no answer from the different powers
was required or expected to the circular
of July 3. but it is understood it has been
everywhere favorably received and that
no objections have been made to it In any
tiuarter. It is not true that there has
Neen any formation of groups or combina
tion of powers of any sort. It may be
positively asserted, for Instance, that the
eo-opcratlon of France and the United
States has boon most constant and most
cordial.
Thp circular which was sent to our for
pjg-n representatives is as follows:

According to a Chefu dispatch the fight-
Ins around Tientsin on the -I<J and 4th was
the severest yet experienced. The British
casualties were thirty or forty killed or
wounded. The Chinese had 35,000 men

Providentially, when things were at |
their worst, a torrential rainfall compelled ;
the Chinese to retire.

JAPAN CANNOT GET
ANY EXTRA TERRITORY
BERLIN, July lO.-The Foreign Office
to-day informed the Associated Press
that all the powers had consented to
Japan landing a large force in China, but
the stipulation was made beforehand that
no power could derive any advantage
territorially from the fact of its having
more troops in China thaJi the others.
The Japanese Government has expressed
perfect willingness to send troops under
th;-se terms.
The Foreign Office denied the correct
ness of the statement by the St. Peters
burg 1 Herald that Germany and Russia
maae a secret agreement last fall for
common action in China, adding: "The
rekiticns between the two governments
have hitherto been so friendly and the
agreement in China so complete that a
treaty has been wholly unnecessary."
An official of the Foreign Office stated
that the meeting of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the Bundesrath, which will
be held to-morrow, will he purely for the
purpose of informing the other German
Cabinets of the status of the China ques
tion, and no decision will be taken.
The North German l,loyd steamer Gera
has be-in chartered by the Ministry of
Marine for a hospital ship for use in Chi
nese waters and the company's new
steamer Strassburg for transport service
there.
The postal authorities publish the an

NEEDLES, July 10.â Since the closing
of the term of school last week at Fort
Mojave there has. been much trouble be
tween the Indians and the superinten
dent. Major J. J. McKoin. It seems that
the parents of the Indian school children
think the children should be permitted to
come home at the close of the school
term, but according to the rules they
must remain at work on the school farm.
A dispatch was sent, at the instance of
the Indians, last week to President Mc-
Kinley saying if the scholars were not al
lowed to come home the "Mojaves will
make trouble." A few days later the In
dian boys ran away from the fort and Su
perintendent tMcKoln with his deputies
have been trying to capture them and
take them back.
Saturday McKoin and a deputy went to
a camp on the Arizona side of the Colo
rado, three miles from .Needles, to take a
boy and were set upon by squaws. Sev
eral bucks appeared on the scene, with
the result that the officials were overcome
and terribly beaten. Sunday three bucks
and one squaw were captured by Consta
ble Burt of Needles and later taken to
Kingman for trial. While in jail here the
building was continually surrounded by
Mojaves who acted In a threatening man
ner. Hundreds are still hanging about
the town and it is feared that trouble of
a serious nature may occur before the In
dian scholars will be returned to the fort.

Immediately after the shooting Mets
was removed to his home and a physician
summoned, who worked with him all day.
He died at 6 o'clock to-night. Daily was
placed under arrest and Sheriff Buckner
of this city was telephoned for, and he
went over and brought Dally back and
landed him In the county jail.
Immediately after arrest Dally began
playing the Insanity dodge, and claims
that he remembers nothing of the affair,
although he Is rational on all other sub
jects. The murder was a cold-blooded
one, and there is considerable feeling in
Lemoore against the murderer. Dally Is
a farmhand, but off and. on tends bar In
saloons in Lemoore. He is not usually
quarrelsome, but drinks considerably at
times. All reports, however, go to Bhow
that he was perfectly sober when he com
mitted the murder. Dally is a married
man, but has no children, while Mets
leaves a large family of children.
District Attorney Irwin went from Han
ford to Lemoore to take Mets' dying
statement, but when he arrived Mets was
unconscious, and remained so until death.
There were several witnesses to the shoot-
Ing, and all declare that the murder was
a cold-blooded one. . When Daily first
tried to shoot the gun would not go off,
but at the second attempt the shot that
will probably put Daily s neck In the

Mets to tix it again. This Mets refused
to do, and high words passed between
them. Daily left, but returned In a short

The necessary papers were placed in the

served the papers and was conversing In
the doorway with Mrs. Matheus when she,
without warning or provocation, drew a
large revolver from the folds of her dress
and pointing the same in Devoto's direc
tion, commenced to snap the hammer, say
ing. "I'll fix you." Finding that none of
the cartridges would explode. Mrs.
Matheus calmly refilled the chambers witn
new shells and remarked, "I guess it will
work now." Taking careful aim at the
'departing Devoto. she worked the hammer
of the revolver in a lively fashion, but
with the same result. None of the
cartridges exploded and Devoto lived to
reach his buggy and gefout of range of
any death-dealing bullets that might be
sent In hia direction. Devoto says that
though he has been an officer for years
this Is the first time a woman has ever
attempted to kill him, and that for cool

will back his late experience for a winner.
He says that if there are any more Mrs.

President J. B. Baker of the University
of Colorado thought the present discus
sion unfavorable. He criticized the com
mittee for not having requested the views
of the presidents of the State colleges and
universities generally. Ho seemed to think
that there was a disposition to Ignore
certain educational Interests to the ad
vantage of other interests. He wanted
the Government to conduct the proposed
university and said steps should be taken
to insure Its proper conduct free of the
cliques of politicians. The discussion was
participated in by many educators.
The report of President Harper was re
ceived by the council, but the committee
was continued. The council deferred for
the present any expression of opinion.
Professor I. M. Butler followed Presi
dent Harper against the Idea of a statu
ary Greek and foreign university at
\\ ashington. He was impressed with the
collections and opportunity for study and
research at Washington, and he was not
in favor of turning Ms back on those op
portunities. He said they should be
grasped and taken advantage of. i In view
of the old established character and repu
tation of the Smithsonian Institution, he
favored building about the old institution
rather than on new ground.
The establishment of a national univer
sity at Washington was the chief topic
discussed at a meeting of the council. Tne
discussion was opened with a paper by
President Harper of the University of
Chicago. President Harper thought the
proposed national university was inexpe
dient and unnecessary. The majority of
the committee, he said, favored a school
of research, which should be centered
about and ultimately associated with the
Smithsonian Institution. A school for
study of international questions, diplo
macy and similar matters also was fa
vored.
The National Council of Education to
day elected the following officers: Presi
dent, C. M. Jordan, Minneapolis; vice
president. Miss B. A. Dutton, Cleveland;
secretary, J. li. P. Phillips, Birmingham,
Ala.
A brief session was held to-night, at
which a paper on "The Small College and
Its Work in the Past" was read by Presi

versity. President Harper of the Uni
versity of Chicago read a brief paper on

CHARLES WILDER, late. Hawaiian
.Consul General to San Francisco,
and Miss Grace Burr, daughter of
Amos Burr, legal agent of the New
York Central Railroad, were married yes
terday at high noon in New York City.
While the young couple had been en
gaged for some time, so well did they
keep their secret that the news of their
union will come as a complete surprise
to almost all their friends.
Mr. Wilder was one of the delegates
representing Hawaii at the recent Demo
cratic convention in Kansas City. Miss
Uurr departed for the East three months
ago to prepare for the wedding, although
it was given out that she was simply on
her way to visit friends.
As a graduate of the Sacred Heart Con
vent, and in society. Miss Burr is well
known in San Francisco.
Mr. Wllder's family is one of the
wealthiest in the islands. His father is
president of the Wilder Steamship I'ora
panv and also controls extensive Ha
waiian business interests.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilder will spend their
honeymoon in Honolulu. The occasion
"That the board of trustees voted to
said Green, as the nominal lessee, with
knowledge and understanding that
three certain members of the board
of trustees who had just resigned
from the board were to be ben
eficiaries and members of a corpora
tion to be later formed to operate the oil
business to be established on the college
grounds."
"Plaintiffs are informed and believe that
defendant did on th,e 24th of November,
1S99, attempt by some false and fraudu
lent proceedings of the board of trustees
of the defendant to alienate said lands
and to make and execute to one Richard
Green a lease of said lands for ten years
for oil purposes, and that the terms and
conditions of said attempted and pretend
ed lease were unfair, unreasonable and
not to the interest of defendant.'"
The whole closes with the following
sensational statement:
Last April judge Rcss granted plain
tiffs an injunction forbidding defendants
from boring for oil. Now the attempt is
made to s<jt aside all title and interest.
The object of this suit is best told in the
following phraseology of section S of the
complaint, as follows: "Notwithstanding
defendant received and accepted from
plalntifi's and G. K. Shatto the described
lands in trust to be used as a campus, and
for educational purposes, the defendants,
without consent of plaintiffs and against
their desire's and protests, did April 9, 1000,
abandon land, ceased to use same as a
campus and for educational purposes, did
divert said property from the purposes
for which it was donated, accepted and
held in trust. On said day and since have
erected derricks, set up engines, oil tanks,
drilled and dug wells, seeking for petro

ANGELS CAMP. July 10.â A most de
structive grass fire has been in progress
a few irAles from this plare since Satur-
BEAR MOUNTAIN IS
SWEPT BY FLAMES
The burned-over district presents a sorry
Fight. Where a few days ago were green
fields and hills topped by trees with
branches apparently piercing the clouds
r<">thing prreets the eye but smolderlnjj
masses with here and there a lost flame
lair.ely struggling upward. The roar as
of thousands of bees swarming is omni
present, broken only by the occasional
crash of a falling giant of the forest and
off in the distance is the pillar of smoke
by day and of fire by night.
Twenty-five or thirty families who were
crimping at Brindlcton fled before the
flames ar:d several others along Bear
Creek were forced to abandon their
cain;.s. They fought the fire for three
days ar.d nights, but finding their efforts
unavailing left the place.
There is no foretelling when the fire will
te controlled. In fact the general impres
sion Is that it will burn itself out. It has
already thread over thousands of acre3
and as many more are doomed. No
definite estimate of the loss can be made
at this time. Standing timber and piles
of cordwood have been destroyed and
acres of splendid pasture land are now
black and smoking.
Undoubtedly many cattle have perished
although no direct reports of losses have
been made. Frightened animals fled be
fore the wall of smoke and fire and are
now wandering a! large among the hills.
It will be days if not weeks before tho
benSa are rounded up and many will be
v.ofuily short.
So far tho flames have been confined to
field and forest, but many buildings have
narrowly escaped destruction. â¢ At one
time it seemed as though the station
house at Iioulder Creek was doomed, but
bv dint of earnest effort it was saved.
As the flames spread the little band of
fireâ fighters wan augmentÂ«-d bv volunteers
from the ranches and the numerous camp
ing resorts, but they were too late. Men
worked like Trojans, pausing for neither
food nor rest, but work as they would
that lurid column was always in advance
at them. The -women also did their part
and passod around refreshments to the
tireless band. Men wiih parched throats
and bodies blackened with smoke- eagerly
pulped down a welcome draught, swal
lowed a morsel of food and were back at
their work.
The fire was started on the night of the
Fourth by a balloon dropping into tho
brash. Before the blaze was noticed a
considerable acreage was in flames. All
the residents of the neighborhood turned
cut to light the fire, but fanned by a
brisk wind It spread with surprising
rapidity. At llrst it was only in the dry
grass and brush and the fire-Jighters were
hopeful. A ellght char.se of the wind di
ver led the course of the column of flame
r.nd the glare on the heavens, followed by
a rumbling, craciUing sound and the
crashing of falling trees, told only too
r>!ainly that the devouring- clement, was
playing havoc In the forests.
SAN'TA CRUZ. July 10. â Latest advices
frora Boulder Creek are to the effect that
f.re !s Btttl raging in the mountains and
&11 efforts to control it have been futile.

by dense columns of smoke and to-night
the ruddy hue en the clouds is noticeable

Special Dispatch to the Call.
day noon. The damage it has wrought
in one way and another is unestimated,
but will amount well into the thousands.
This is the lirst fire this season of any
great importance, and has set wonderful
object lessons on the necessity of guard
ing against such accidents. It Is not
known how the tire originated, but there
is a possibility of it being the work of an
incendiary. O:Â» Saturday the alarm was
rirst Founded, and hardly had the work
of extinguishing the first blaze begun be
fore the wind turned and the fire swept
from one hill to another, until Bear Moun
tain was one mass of flame and smoke.
The column of smoke rose to a great
height, and men from the surrounding
ranches rode to the tire to enter into an
all-nisht struggle With a mighty effort
the course of the fire was turned and
kept within a limit for the night. House
wives remained in their kitchens all night
to cook and prepare food and stimulants
for the tire-lighters on the mountain.
Stock was herded to and fro as the lire
progressed on its course, destroying hun
dreds upon hundreds of acres of pastur
age, fences and corded wood.
Strenuous efforts were made to keep the
(Ire from reaching- the ranch houses, and
in this the efforts were crowned with
success.
On Sunday the fire broke away asaln,
ai:<i with a roar like a distant cannonade
started down the valley at the base ot
Bear Mountain. Men. wearied with their
efforts and all-ni??ht vlgrila, rushed beyond
to '"back tire" and try to turn the course
but before they were aware of it a llame
shot across Angels Creek and into the
treetops on the opposite side, a distance
of SOO or 400 feet. Almost Immediately a
cloud of the blackest smoke rose into the
:>.'.r and could be plainly seen for mile*?
around. All efforts to check the fire were
in vain, and it swept on for four miles to
the Stanislaus River, -which It reached In
two hours. Every effort is being made
to keep it from jumping across the river,
and men are stationed on Bear Mountain
to keep a close watch and sound the
alarm in the event of the fire starting up
a^rain.
The appearance of the country over
which the lire burned Is one of desola
tion. Stockmen, who pasture In the hiph
mountains during: , the summer months
and In the burned section during the
winter, will suffer the greatest, as the
supply of prass is entirely destroyed.
Unless early rains set in the stock will
suffer greatly.

In fact, a wise newspaper man. after reviewing care
fully all the orders, would .ponder' deeply' upon .that
which warns him to bear in mind that the Czar is ac
tuated only by a "desire to maintain peace and good
will among the nations, and he would devote his paper
mainly to an agitation for another international con
ference on the subject of general disarmament.
About the only consoling thing for editors which
the orders contain is the decree that editorial writers
should recollect that Russia is predestined to pre
dominate in Asia. That announcement will save a
whole lot of wear and tear on the editorial brain. It
affords them one subject on which they can write
at large and freely, hist as in the United States it is
always permissible to twist the lion's tail. There Is
of course some little further relief in the assurance
that comparisons may be made between Russians and
foreign troops and seamen when unfavorable to for
eigners, but after all comparisons arc odious and are
likely to be risky. Some comparison, for example,
might be made unfavorable to the troops of the
Kaiser, and then the editor would be subject to con
demnation for "gossip displeasing to the Govern
ment!" .'.-.
Under these instructions the censors will have an
easy time in dealing with any newspaper that under
takes to publish war news. There will be no need to
read it. Its suppression can be ordered at once, for
how could any such news be published without say
ing something about the movements of Russian fleets
and armies, or criticisms upon them for not moving?
The order forbidding gossip about differences among
the powers, will go far toward justifying a suppression
of any sort of discussion of international events or o?
the European concert. Finally, what can be said of
any feature of foreign affairs when there is to be rio
criticism of Russian diplomacy or of military or naval
strategy?

SINCE the failure of his peace conference to set

THE CZAR'S LATEST FAD.
Among the earnest Republicans of the city there
should be something of a canvass on the issue. Pass
the question round, "Have you registered?" Let the
attention of all good citizens be directed to this duty.
It is imperative.
To the Republicans of San Francisco the issue is of
particular importance. They have to combat Crim
mins and Kelly within the party as well as the Bryan
ite demagogues without. Not one single loyal Repub
lican should by a neglect to register forfeit his privi
lege of voting right at the coming election. Every
stanch Republican vote will be needed.
It can hardly be necessary to point out the impor
tance of the issues at stake in the coming election.
They concern every citizen and affect every business
interest. The forces of discontent are banded to
gether in a firmer organization than ever before, and
constitute a formidable force. They can be defeated
only by the energetic action of all who stand for pro
tection, sound money, conservative government and
prosperity. It is as sure as shooting that all who are
discontented will register; all the gangs of bar
room voters -who follow and uphold the bosses will
register; every voter who has a vott he wishes to sell
will register â in short, all the evil elements of our
political life will be registered, and unless there be on
the rolls a preponderance of good citizens the vote of
California will be given for Bryan.
It may be that many citizens have forgotten that
there is to be a complete new registration this yeaÂ«-.
The fact that a citizen has not changed his residence
since the last election does not exempt him from the
necessity of reregistering. All must register. Those
who do not will forfeit their right to vote.
On that showing it will be seen that those who wish
to avoid the delay attendant upon, a rush at the regis
tration onice will have to act at once. At the present
time the applicant will be promptly attended to.
Later on there will be a crowd daily at the office, and
each new comer will have to take his place in line and
wait until his turn comes to be served. There is no
reason why any citizen should subject himself to that
inconvenience, for the law gives ample time for reg
istering, and those who are caught in the rush at the
closing days will have only themselves to blame if
they have to stand a Jong time in line instead of being
attended to at once.
REGISTER WITHOUT DELAY.
REGISTRAR WALSH has given notice tnat up
to Monday only abont 13.000 of the voters o)
the city have registered. As there are about
:2,00a voters in the city, it will be seen there has not
been anything like the registration there should have
been. It is to be borne in mind that registration for
;he general election cies.es September 2b, and accord
nglv if all who are entitled to vote should desire to
io so the applications for registration from this time
in will average about 1000 a day.
A GOOD move has been made by the Native
Sons in organizing a committee on information
and publicity for the purpose of advertising the
coming jubilee celebration not only to the Pacific
Coast States but throughout the Union. Such adver
tising is bound to be beneficial. All advertising is,
and California can never have too much of it.
In the reports sent to the East special stress should
be laid upon the cool, invigorating air of San Fran
cisco summers. California has been mainly noted as
a winter resort. The enterprising men who built up
the southern section of the State have made the at
tractions of the winter well known to tourists, and
consequently the tide of such travel comes West at
that season and returns East with the spring. Now
California offers as many inducements to Eastern
people to leave the sweltering cities of that section in
the summer and the early fall as it does for them to
escape the blizzards of the winter, and the fact should
be thoroughly advertised.
At the present time the whole East, from Maine to
Georgia, is complaining of an excessively hot sum
mer. It is in vain that the people fly from the Mis
sissippi Valley to the Atlantic seashore in search of
cool breezes, for it is about as hot in the one place
as in the other. If the pleasantness of the California
summer were made as fully^ known as is the mildness
of the California winter, it is hardly to be doubted
that we should have almost as large a number of tour
ists in the northern part of the State from June until
October as there are in the southern counties from
January to May.
The coming celebration will have many attractions
for Eastern people as well as for those of the Pacific
Coast. Climate is not the only delight we shall have
to offer to all visitors at that time. From the prepara
tions already made it is evident the festival will be
one of the finest and most enjoyable in our history.
It is therefore right that the people of every section
of the Union should be notified of the event and in
vited to come West and join in it. Extensive adver
tising will at least let the country know that we are
alive and flourishing and have a welcome for all.

Speaking under the caption of "The
Pothouse Bosses," the San Francisco Call
says that Kelly and Crlmmlns haveÂ«about
as much right In the Republican party
"as a burglar In a bank," and further
says about them that "It is better to keep
a polecat out of your house than to let
him In and then try to put him out."
Correct. In the name of political decency
and common sense don't allow the Re
publican party to be a haven or refuge
for Democratic skunks. They are good
for nothing other than to raise a stink
and Infect any organization In which they
are permitted to parade, to the extent of
driving out respectability. Bury them
deep Into oblivion, where they belong.
Those Infectious animals are altogether
too offensive to the olfactories of decent
people. They have stunk up their old
nest so as to be unbearable to their old
time â¢ political associates, and It is no
wonder that they must be run out.

PERSONAL MENTION.
They were the very States that crowded it down the
party's throat in 1896. Their politicians made it the
eternal and overshadowing issue, ahd used it success
fully to take the party away from Mr. Cleveland's
leadership. Since then the gold standard has been
adopted. Prosperity to the South has followed, ami
now only Alabama, Delaware,. Kentucky, Missouri
and South Carolina could be whipped into standing
against the sound financial cause of that prosperity.
An analysis of the reason why they remained in their
wallow discloses that since Bayard's death and Gray's
promotion to the bench Delaware Democracy is de
bauched. Alabama Democrats are unanimously for
holding the Philippines, following the lead of Mor
gan, and feel that they must make one folly balance
another. As for Kentucky, any State that will .send
Jo Blackburn to succeed Lindsay and Carlisle in the
Senate will do anything. Missouri is afraid that Dick
Eland's ghost will come again if she fail to stand for
free silver, and down in that country nothing is feared
like "a hant." Of course South Carolina had to stand
by the unspeakable Tillman, and there you are! Free
silver, the great Southern issue remembered by only
five out of fifteen States! In the North the great
States of California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin stood like a wall against
free silver, or any kind of silver, at any ratio. They
were beaten, defeated, downed and overruled by the
votes of Hawaii and Alaska! Had those two far ami
rotten boroughs not been in the convention the vote
would have stood 25 against free silver to 25 for, and
the tie would have lost the affirmative side and the
cause itself. When Hawaii and Alaska are called in to
referee, or umpire, xn issue that so intimately affects
the welfare of great commercial and business States,
and a combined constituency of the two, amounting
to less than three thousand, who don't vote at the
Presidential election, fastens a policy upon a" party
that seeks to control the government, it is time for
citizens of the republic to combine their strength and
repudiate such primacy in their affairs from such a
source. /
The result was not reached without much bad blood
being shown. George Fred Williams expressly put
it on the ground that the party must please the Popu
lists, and he declared this preferable to doing any
thing to win back "the traitors" who organized the
Gold Democracy in 1896. George Fred may be fol
lowed by his tracks, heel to every party and toe to the
camp of another, in his several political elopements.
The charms of Bryan have satisfied him longer than
any other, but after the next election he may be seen
at the window with, his rope ladder, waiting for the
new party to whistle.
That California and Oregon stood against silver
is significant. It shows that the party leaders in these
two States have learned something in four years. They
see their only chance for life is repudiation of Popu
lism and all its works. They sec also that with free
silver in the platform the Pacific Coast will continue
Republican. So mote it be.-
THERE was some comedy and some tragedy in
the struggle in Kansas City over the silver
plank. A large part of the Democratic conven
tion were aware of the Chicago platform as a dark
brown taste in the party's mouth. When its reitera
tion was demanded the very men who helped make it
objected, on the ground that its clauses damnatory
of the courts were put in on account of the Chicago
strike riots, and as these were forgotten now there are
no votes in attacking the courts! There have been
strange things, and for strange motives, put in na
tional platforms before, but we doubt if anything
equals this admission of the reason for threatening to
destroy the judicial protection of the rights of person
i and property. ' Â¦
At Kansas City the battle in the platform committee
' first raged over the question of reaftirmation or re
iteration of the Chicago platform. The difference is
not to be distinguished by any except the politicians,
j who were hunting for some form of action which
I would catch the votes of two diametrically opposed
elements, by making each believe that the platform
agreed with it upon the very point that divides them.
The students of theological division have been often
puzzled over the difference between Houmosianism
I and Homousianism. Hereafter the students of
j American politics will puzzle over the difference that
| caused battle between the reaflirmationists and the re
i iterationi?ts at Kansas City.
It appears by whit information dribbled through
the keyhole that the leaffirmation party was made up
of those who supported Bryan four years ago, on the
ground of regularity, reinforced by some who thought
free silver was a good winner, but have changed their I
minds. The first supported silver but believed in the
gold standard, and were in actual sympathy with til?
Gold Democrats, who had the courage of their con
victions and were come-outers.
â¢ These two elements desired to slough silver, free
coinage, ratio and all. and to retire the Chicago plat
form from public view by saying that it was re
affirmed.
The reiteration party, led by George Fred Williams
cf Massachusetts, were certain that silver contained
victory and insisted en fighting the second baftle, so
as not to obsolete the title of Colonel Bryan's cele
brated book and cause it to be known as "The Last
Battle."
The two parties were in contention all day and
nearly all night. It was really the struggle of Jeffer
sonianism against Bryanism, of Democracy against
Populism, and Populism won by putting a specific
free silver plank in the platform, divinely appointed
ratio and all. The vote was close, 25 to 27, and by
that narrow margin the attempt of the soul of the old
Democracy to crawl back into its body was defeated
and Populism remains in possession of the carcass.
How it was brought about is interesting. Against
free silver were ten out of the fifteen Southern States.
THE SILVER PLAISK-
ed were: Most Rev. P. W. Riordan, Rev.
Philip O'Ryan, Colonel Edward J. Power.

ground Is hard and smooth. Insuring
healthy surroundings. Colonel Power has
engaged several drill masters who are to
instruct the cadets in the handling of the
sword and in general drill. A committee

coming encampment will eclipse all others
in every respect.
ART AND ARTISTS.
THERE Is. a curious specimen of the
English school of animal paintersâ
that school which Is headed by Sid
ney Cooper. A. R. A., on exhibition
in town this week. Curtained In silk
and with a $2000 label attached, it is natu
rally approached with respect, but this
sheep picture of W. Watson's requires
these and several other accessories
to persuade to seriousness. It is an amus
ing composition of the conventional pyra
midal plan, and the sheep are dragged in
anyhow to'conform to the pattern. The
method of treatment is photographic,
every hair on every sheep Is painted and
every blade of grass Is given. Absolutely
nothing Is left to the imagination. The
color has the same painful literalness,
and, all things considered, the curtain
and the price are a distinct impertinence.
In the same gallery, for contrast, is a.
charming little sheep picture of Felix
Brlssot, In which drawing, color and
composition are alike admirable. The
sheep- are drawn with a sure and tender
touch; the sky is luminous and alive; the
foreground is fitted to its purpose with a
fine intuition, and the whole effect is
truthful and beautiful.
There are a couple of John Hafen's pic
tures, made in California, on exhibition
here this week. One, a Leona Heights
landscape, is a very pleasing composition,
with the exception of an amorphous mass
of foliage in the middle distance, which
mars the effect. It la nice color all
through, though perhaps a bit cold. The
other picture is a wood and atream sub
ject and is fairly interesting. Mr. Hafen
is now painting in Monterey.
There are other artists In Monterey
also, quite a Brittany school of them.
Sidney J. Yard. Theodore Wores, Charles
Rollo Peters, Miss Evelyn McCormick and
C. Chapel Judson are there.
Others out of town are Eugene Cada
nasso, who is painting In Mill Valley, and
Josephine Edwards Capwell at Rancho
Bonlta. Saratoga. Arthur F. Matthews
is visiting his Mendoclno home and will
stay a few weeks there.
Thaddeus Welch has a nice color
scheme in his sketch of Bolinas Bay. now
some time on exhibition* and it is a happy
little composition.
An Interesting study of appointments,
with an Incidental figure, is the large wa
ter-color by Louis Bailly. His textures
are admirable. Ills carved wood is real
wood, hard and shining. The brasses and
tapestry are unmistakably metal and
wool, and the Persian rug seems velvet
to the touch. The girl's head is deftly
and charmingly treated, but not so the
hand, which is illy drawn, and no girl's
hand, either. As a composition the can
vas is too "busy." There Is no center of
interest. Now the cabinet attracts: now
the rug: then the oaken chest, and so on.
till the girl's figure, naturally the chief
theme. Is lost sight of In the division of
interest. An embarrassment of riches,
truly.

RUMOR THAT CHINESE

Custom-House Gossipers Agitated by
Wild Story of Retaliation

port of the rumor. It was said that no
Chinese had been allowed to land within

Collector Jackson and Chief Dunn of

day taking Assistant Secretary SpauMing

who knows more than any other man in

had been received from Washington, and
that If there had been he would have

The argument for a department of labor has not
been so apparent as that for the commerce depart
ment. The present Labor Bureau has done it's work
with eminent success, and it is doubtful whether much
a ould be gained by raising it to the rank of a Cabinet
department. But the request of the miners for a de
partment of mines and mining,- which both parties
have overlooked, is fully as important as either of
those which have been indorsed. The mining indus
try is one of the largest in the country, and has im
portant branches in every section of the Union/ Its
affairs are now scattered through half a dozen
bureaus, and are even more confused than those of
commerce. Therefore, when Congress enters upon
a consideration of the claims of commerce and of la
bor for Cabinet departments it should not be per
mitted to overlook the claims which the mining men
have so long and so justly urged.
There are no reasons why there should.be any par
tisanship in matters of this kind, and it is not likely
that any will arise. The industrial and commercial
activities of the country have outgrown the present
governmental forms. Much of our commercial busi
ness is now carried ori under bureaus of the Treasury
Department, while all the consular offices are under
control of the State Department. Thus there is con
fusion and divided authority where there should be
system and harmony, and as a consequence the de
mand for a department of commerce has been long
manifest.

"I cannot leave without saying good
by," Eaid Judge Estee. "and I must say
that the word has never before seemed so
difficult to pronounce, I believe that It is
possible for a judge to be a man and I
will always try to be a true American. I
hope that the love for my country, and
especially for California, may never be
supplanted. I have resided here for forty
eeven years, having first set foot on this
soil when I was 19 years of age. It is
with a feeling of profound regret that I
leave California, The regret is somewhat
palliated, however, when I remember that
the District Court of Hawaii Is in the
Ninth Circuit District and I will therefore
be enabled to visit you twice a year.
THE reception tendered to Hon. M. M.
Estee. United States District Judge
for the Territory of Hawaii, by the
Union League Club last night, drew
several hundred representative citizens to
the club rooms at the Palace Hotel. The
distinguished guest was bidden godspeed
in eloquent speeches delivered by gentle
men affiliated both with the Republican
and Democratic parties. Men who stand
high in judicial councils also said a kindly
word for the man selected for high office
by the Ckief Executive of the nation.
The affair was Informal and non-parti
san and the assemblage was presided over
by A. G. Booth, president of the Union
league. Seated on the platform was Judge
Estee. whom he introduced in a felicitous
speech. Judge Estee was greeted with
prolonged applause and it was several
minutes before he was allowed to proceed.
Justice Brown of the United States Su
preme Court followed Judge Morrow, and
after a reference to the highly honorable
"We are proud that a man who repre
sents so well the best Interests of this
State " said Judge Morrow, "has been se
lected for so Important a task as that of
inaugurating a judicial system in a new
country. Judge Estee has a clean slate
in a Federal way in Hawaii, for there
have been no lawyers or judges before him
to muss up legal matters. If he does not
do what is right it is his own fault. There
are splendid opportunities before him in
the Federal judiciary, and I am sure he
will take advantage of them."
Justice Keatty, referring in his letter to
Judge Estee, says: "His appointment is a
deserved tribute to his professional stand
ing and his personal worth, and I venture
to predict that his career as a Judge will
amply vindicate the wisdom of his selec
tion. His good sense, good temper, sound
learning and unquestioned integrity qual
ify him In an eminent degree for the
judicial office."
After a brief complimentary speech by
Irving M. Scott, Judge Morrow congratu
lated Mr. Estee In an interesting talk.
The appointment of Mr. Estee to the highest
Judicial post in Hawaii is approved by all good
Californlans of all parties. He has been a
friend without faltering/ a public character
without culle, a partisan without rancor, a
lawyer wlthcut chicane and a gentleman with
cut blemish. He goes to the high duty of or
ganizing an American judiciary In the land
ot" the Kamehamehas. fully equipped in pro
fessional learning, and if the numerous wishes
of his friends affect the fates his voyage will
be on halcyon seas and his future filled with
the pleasures that wait upon, a faithful and
honorable life.

Chairman Booth then read letters from
John P. Irish and Chief Justice Beatty.
Both gentlemen expressed their regrets
"It was destined that sooner or later
Mr. Estee should meet his reward for the
years of faithful service he has given his
party," said Senator Perkins. "It was his
sterling worth and manly qualities that
induced the President to so honor our dis
tinguished townsman. M. M. Estee has
done so much for California that his name
should be inscribed in letters of gold upon
the pages of lts'history. He will earn the
confidence of the people of those Islands,

away. The Senate has passed a bill ap
propriating sufficient money to lay a cable
to Honolulu. Let Kahn and Loud tlnish
the other half of the work In Congress,
and next February we will but have to
touch the key to talk to Judge Estee."
Turning to. Mr. Estee, Senator Perkins
said in feeling accents:
"May the brightest anticipation of your
life be realized."
United States Senator Perkins was then
called on by Chairman Booth and paid
a glowing tribute to the high character
of the man whom those present had gath
ered to greet.
the people need have no regret3 over the
annexation of Hawaii. It will be my
special aim to administer wisely the Fed
eral law. If I fail to give a lawful inter
pretation of the principles of justice I will
not blame you for being glad that I have
gone and for hoping that I may never
come back to you again. A judicial friend
of mine informed me this afternoon that
a real judge should never make any prom
ises and should never make a speech. I
am afraid that I am but Illy following his
advice. I desire to state, however, that
I thoroughly appreciate the honor that
has been conferred upon me and also this
beautiful expression of your friendship to
one who Is going away. I trust that I will
continue to be worthy of it all."

"Whatever may be said about imperial

membered that the Hawaiian Islands were
made a part of the United States not by
conquest, but by a union of hearts and
tiags arid owing to the volition of their
people. It is therefore not subject to
the objections of Imperialism. It will bo

peal from the court of Hawaii, of which
our guest is destined to be so distin
guished an exponent."
Justice McFarland said that Judge
Estce was well qualiiled to fill the impor
tant position to which he had been ap
pointed, and many people v.-ill regret to
see him go. He bade the parting guest
godspeed and hoped that in his new
career he would meet with unbounded
success.
General Barnes made a felicitous speech
In which he expressed his confidence that
Judge Esteo would establish the principles
of truth, Justice and equity in Hawaii.
"The Christian law and the maintenance
of right will be safe in your hands," con
cluded Barnes, "and I wish you all the
success that you are certain to meet in
the administration of justice."
Frank H. Gould eaid that Democrats aa
well as Republicans have a gveat admi
ration for the man who was being hon
ored before his departure to assume an
office which he was eminently tltted to
occupy. He congratulated the people of
the State and the United States in having
a man on the Hawaiian bench who had
never committed a dishonorable act in his
whole career. â¢

GOES ON A TOUR
OF VISITATION
George J. Boyne of the Forty-third As
sembly District, who had been waiting
impatiently for a parliamentary chance
to launch his protest against the methods
of J. J. Curry, sprang to his feet imme
diately after the announcement of the
vote on the resolutions. He demanded
that T. K. Kase, a Republican spokes
man, should be heard. A. R. Smith en
deavored to Interpose an objection on the
ground that no protest had been lodged,
but Mr. Boyne was persistent. In his in
sistence he was ably seconded by Orator
Kase, who essayed to address the meet-
Ing with the freedom of one possessing
the power and influence of a regular mem
ber. Chairman Bouvier reminded the vis
iting orator that freedom of speech - on
the occasion was a prerogative of the
members and did not extend to guests.
When Kase subsided Boyne "bobbed up,"
and between the two the floor was held.
As a question- of personal privilege Boyne
pleaded that Kase be heard. He inti
mated that refusal. to hear Kase might
cost the party an Assemblyman in the
district. The committee finally yielded
and Kase came to the front with privilege
to speak for ten minutes. . ,
Mr. Kase spoke rapidly, reviewing the
events of the double-headed meeting In
the Forty-third District on Monday night.
He insisted that the officers elected at the
meeting over which Curry presided re
ceived only forty votes. He remarked
that the roll was not called, as the plan
The ' petitions mentioned in the fore
going resolution must be filed with the
Election Commissioners not later than
next Saturday. . _
In response to inquiries Chairman
Bouvier explained that the apportionment
of delegates was made according to tho
requirements of the election law.
The law, In its application to the
State convention, requires that tho
average vote of certain State officers shall
furnish the basis of representation;
whereas, in local conventions, the average
vote of. all candidates of the party" in the
territory is reckoned. The apparent In
equalities in district representation were
thus accounted for. Figures of thes. vote
were obtained from the Registrar's
ofllce.
The chairman advised the members that
no proxies would be allowed, and that the
expenses to Santa Cruz would be paid by
the individual delegates.
That the chairman and secretary of this com
mittee be and are hereby authorized and in
structed to file on behalf of this committee
with the Election Commissioners of the city
and county of Ban Francisco any and all pe
titions or Instruments required by law.

"I do not know what the vote- was." re
plied Major Bettis. "but if the ballot box
was stuffed, who were the stuffers on our
side? Who were the stuffers that came
in with the other crowd? Everything pro
ceeded orderly till they came In at 9
o'clock and demanded the roll call and to

against them In accordance with correct
"Mr. Kase has told you what has hap
pened and Mr. Boyne has told you what
will happen. Now. let me tell you what
will not happen. If you disorganize the
club which I lepresent not one of those
who helped elect its officers will go over

that came in with the other crowd may,
for I saw among them some of the low
browed specimens that you see south of
Market street or hanging around Billy
Abbott's saloon."
- The remark was an unfortunate one, as
a friend of a commltteeman from south of
Market street who was standing near the
door resented It, and voiced his objection
in vigorous terms. He wanted it under
stood that there were no "low-browed"
specimens south of Market street, and he
wouldn't "stand for" any slurs on his dis
trict. It took the combined efforts of
Chairman Bouvier and a special officer to
restore order.
â¢ "From sixty to eighty men were present
at our meeting," resumed Major Bettis.
"Everything "was conducted regularly and
orderly. Nominations were made without
hurry and in regular form, and nomina
tions were not closed until plenty of time
had been given. Then the vote began.
Every name on the roll was called, and
any statement to the contrary Is false."
The speaker was again interrupted, this
time by G. J. Boyne, who wanted to know
how it was if, as the speaker had said,
there were but sixty or eighty present, 245
votes had been cast.
of organization required, and that no op
portunity was afforded for the election of
officers. He said;
"Shall the Forty-third District Repub
licans, standing tor decency and against
bosses, be excluded from the right to se
lect representatives of their party? "We
protest against the action of a very small
minority. We say dissolve both clubs in
the district and give us a chance to re
organize. Give us. a chance to demon
strate, that we represent the anti-boss
Republicans."
The call of "time" prevented an exten
sion of the speech.
Major F. A. Bettis was called upon by
Chairman Bouvier to reply^ and was In
troduced as chairman or the regular or
ganization of the Firty-thlrd Assembly
District.
"This controversy hurts me," said Major
Bettis. "I am a Republican of fifty-six
years' standing, and this is the first time
I have been in a Republican row. I have
opposed Democrats for many years, and I
fought them for four years. But this row
hurts me.
The chairman asked members of the
committee to send to the secretary the
addresses of the officers of the district
clubs and to urge upon Republicans the
necessity of registering without delay. A
thousand voters must be registered each
working day that remains in order that
none may be deprived of a vote.
A motion to adjourn wa3 made, and
Chairman Bouvier said in answer to a
query that the contest In the Forty-third
District organization would be settled by
the advisory and executive committee. A3
scon as a protest was filed Chairman Tru
man of the joint committee would call a
meeting to take up the question.
parliamentary usage. The count was fin
ished and I took the chair, but the racket
made by the disturbers was so great that
we could not proceed and we were com
pelled to adjourn."
Major Bettis closed his speech within
the ten-minute limit. Â«

France Is Becoming Quite a Center
Even official reports Issued from French
Government bureaus nowadays must give
Fome aid and comfort to temperance cru
saders. Thus a bulletin issued by the
Department of Finance a few months ago
afserts that alcoholism is making alarm
ing progress In France. In fifty years the
production of alcohol there has increased
two and a half fold and the consumption
per capita Is three times as' largo as It
was half a century ago. Official warning
is piven of the great evil this vast con
sumption of alcohol is inflicting upon the
country- Tho amount of money wasted
in drink is very great, but the Io0.0u0.000
Irenes spent annually for liquors in
France is as nothing compared with the
lmnairrai til of the public health.
Now comes M. Kaoul Leroy with an
article In the Annales de Hygiene on his
study of alcoholism In Brittany. He says
that since 1>i35 the consumption of alcohol
there has been steadily Increasing and la
now two and a half times as large per
capita as it was sixty-five years ago. The
Increase or diminution of . the tax on
brandy has never had the slightest Influ

Increased. kef-ping pace apparently witn.
the progress of alcoholic consumption.
Another French Journal calls attention
to the growth of alcoholism in Chile. ThÂ«
mattrr has recently bÂ«*en debated in the
Congress of that country. Some of the
Deputies asserted that unless steps wens
lak^n very soon to stop the spread of the
evil the health and morals of the inhab
itants would be completely undermined.
According to the figures adduced during
tho discussion the number of persons
sdlrted to the excessive use of alcohol In
thirty-thre* departments is CS.592. A re
marlcablv' high p*rc*?ntage of drunkards
is found In Santiago and Valparaiso. San

DOXALD WHALEN, aged 14. an
elevator boy at the Bohemian Ho

sent by the landlady yester'day
afternoon to clean windows on the third
floor facing Stockton street. "While clean
ing one of the windows he lost his hold
and fell to the sidewalk, a distance of
about forty feet. He struck on his left
side, and It was almost a miracle that he
was not killed outright.
The ambulance was summoned and tho
boy was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Dorr found that his left arm
was broken above the wrist, that there
was a contusion on his left shoulder and
that he was suffering from concussion of
the spine and " internal injuries. His
chances of recovery are doubtful.
The boy's parents live at 375 Natoma
street, lie secured the job as elevator
boy last Saturday, being his first since he
left school. He said he happened to look
toward the street and ft made him dizzy
and he lost his hold. Some "people who
saw him fall rushed toward him, expect
ing to find his mangled body, but he was
conscious and only complained of severe
pains In his back.

the holders of property might find It dif
ficult to sell their lots until the matter is
straightened out. Endless litigation is
liable to result, although the tanjrle could
very easily be settled by having the cfty
give new titles to the present holders
of the property. It is claimed that all
the property in Mnnnasse and Schiller's
Addition, lying south of Sherman's Addi
tion, Is also affected by the ruling, as a
similar deed was given In conveying that
property.
SAX DIEGO, July *10.â In the Superior
Court this afternoon Judge Torrance ren
dered a decision which will tend to cast a
cloud on the titles to a great portion of
the property in Sherman's Addition to the
city, as be holds that the deed transfer
ring the property from the city of San
Diego to Sherman was of no force and ef
fect. The reason for his ruling is that the
Trustees executed the deed not as officers
of the city, but in their private capacity.
There are seventy-two blocks of larul in
the addition, extending from Fourteenth
street to Twenty-fourth and from H to N
and if the ruling of the Judge is sustained*
the present holders of the property will
have to obtain another title from the city
or go without any. The ruling was made
in the case of Ida Fuller vs. Nellie Likens
an action to quiet title to several lots on
Sherman Heights.
The case was partially tried bv Judge
Torrance sitting in Department *2 in the

and Thomas II. Bush, who were Trustees
at that time. IX C. Collier represented the
defendant and objected to the admittance
of the deed on the ground that it was void
and did not convey any property.
He pointed out the fact that the deed
conveyed only "the interests of J. S Man

and their successors in office," nothing be

a Knockout.
NEW YORK. July lO.-At the Seaside
Athletic Club to-night Joe M. Gans of
Baltimore was awarded the decision over
Albert Griffith, better known as "'Young
Griffo," of Australia. The referee stopped
the bout after the men had fought one
minute and thirty-eight seconds of the
eighth round, when Griffo was so far
gone that another punch from Gans would
have put him out. For a time Griffo
showed some of his oldtlme form and
tegan punching in clever style, but his
dissipation has told on him, and, although
h..' had trained faithfully for the light,
he had not the steam to stand the ne
gro's blows. Cans played a. waiting game
and when Griffo had fougrht himself out
found no difficulty in putting him into
such that the referee's action
was pleasing- to the crowd. There was
little betting and Gans was a 5 to 1 fa
vorite.

over Dick O'Brien of Lewi=ton, Me., at

the fiercest battles ever witnessed In thia

probably the result would have been dif

three times in the second round., Root
rallied quickly and came up In pretty good
shape for the next round. O'Brien tried
hard to finish his youngf opponent, but In
his eajrerness to gain a knockout he left
himself open and was sent down for the
count just an the round ended.
This seemed to wÂ«vÂ»lten the N'ew Eng

Ten bouts before the San Francisco Ath
letic Club last night, a few of which did
not run the set limit of four rounds, net
ted the Sweeney fund just *21U. What the
crowd lacked in numbers it made up in
enthusiasm and all in all the evening's
entertainment was of a kind that satisfied
the tight-hungry audience.
The bouts improved as the weight of the
contestants increased. Down toward the
end of the programme where the welter
and the middle weights were placed, there
were some matciies which were ot the
whirlwind variety. The lucky ones earned
medals donated by members of the club
and presented with speeches that drew
cheersâ and sometimes tearsâ from the
spectators. Among the speechmakers
was Congressman Julius Kahn, v.ho
tickled the tancy of his constituents by
some very apropos remarks.
The last tight of the evening. was the
best. Walter Moreno, longshoreman and
tyro at the pugilistic game, faced Joe
Long, hardened in a career of many bat
tles. An extra round was called by the
judges and Referee Greggains, but even
this did not sutlice to settle the result pos
itively. A draw was the decision and it
was a fair one.
Uecause William Mattheson. the pride
of the newsboys, a 140-pounder, lost the
decision to Jack Anderson, there will be
mourning on the corner of Powell and
Market streets for the next four weeks.
All the newsboy sporting fraternity
backed their fellow-friend heavily. Be
hind Mattheson was a bunch of them and
they wept bitter tears when Alex Greg
gains announced Anderson as the victor.
The light between Ed Cones and Pete
Fransen was a draw. Jack Hart found
Kid Parker of the 120-pound class very
easy and the medal which will shine from
Hart's breast tells a story of weariness
on Parker's part in the nrst round, when
the entire battle was fought and won. Al
Whitman went the same way to Hugh
iTiel. who also has a medal as evidence
of his punching powers. This bout
lasted two rounds. Krank Wall took Jim
Little s measure in four rounds, a decision
In his favor giving him something to weal
on his bosom. Three rounds were all
that were necessary for Fred Larsen to
put out Jim Waller.
The police stopped the bout between Gus
Salsbury and Harry Glassman in the third
round, just as the latter was about to nod.
Then came the welters and the middle
weights. Ld Tomalty and Dick Anelecy
Played a combination part of Graeco-
Roman, London prize ring and Marquis
of Queensberry, Anglecy being scratched
off the card In the third heat. H. Schil

prove Jhe wonder that was expected of

the end of the round. O'Brien overbal
anced from a wild swing and Root knock
ed him through the ropes. He got back
before time was up and had a shade the
better of a fierce mix-up as tho round
ended.
In the fifth and sixth rounds Root got
his left hand working and smothered
O'Brien with jabs. O'Brien never let up,
however, but kept on the aggressive and
appeared to be willing to take anything
Root could send to get a chance for a
knockout. Toward the end of the round
Root went down from a hard swing. He
jumped up quickly, and had the better
of the remainder of the fight.
O'Brien's poor condition began to tell
in the last round nnd he showed up per
ceptibly weak. Root landed almost at
will with the left, while most of O'Brien's
blows were wild. O'Brien got a glimpse
of dreamland from a right jab just as the
contest ended. O'Brien was far from be
ing a whipped man, as his opponent was
in nearly as bad shape. Â¦ Both men were
bleeding from a half-dozen different places
as Referee George Siler announced Root
the winner.
' The betting was 2 to 1 that Root would
sret the decision nnd even money that
Root would win with a knorkout. The
men met at catch weights. O'Drlen had

"When the gentlemen riders, polo play
ers, tennis experts, golf devotees and
yachtsmen gather at Del Monte next
month there will be a week of general
sport that will last long in the minds of
society. The programme of events has
been prepared and now all that remains
to be done is to wait patiently for the en
tries.
The racing card published last week
will stand almost in Its entirety. One
change that has been adopted is to have
the sixth race a quarter instead of live
eighths of a mile and open to all racing
ponies, the former restriction as to polo
ponies having been abolished.
The programme for the golf tournament

Rafael Creek.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. July 10.â Tho schooner
Mamie of San Francisco struck a rock at
the mouth of San Rafae! Creek early this
morning. The vessel was loaded with hay
consigned to Schlosser. a merchant of thla
city. Much of the cargo i3 damaged and
an effort is being made to save what is
worth rescuing by transferring It to thÂ»
schooner Columbia.
It is not known how serious, the Mamla
is damaged. As s>oon as her cargo Is re
moved an effort will be made to float her.
The cause of the accident was the re
moval of certain stakes which have here
tofore marked the course of the channel.
The Mamie was commanded by Captain
Herman.

with the Californian.
Smash, bang, they went at one another
and it eoon became apparent to Neill that
this new man was out for real, red blood,
even though his fists were encased in pil
lows. The result of it all was that Mr.
Ford recelvd several successive jolts on
the chin and to (the ground he went. Con
stellations floated in panoramic effects be
fore his eyes. Neill says he was never
better and but for a slightly stiff right
arm he would call himself a fighter in
prime physical condition. For the matter
of that Moffatt sings the same song with
out the stiff arm. The betting is close to
even. 10-8 in favor of Moffatt being the
starter.
Al Xelll is also polishing off the rough
edges. In his workshop at the Terminal
he fights battles with "has beens" and
hopeful ones who look to the ring as the
means of obtaining future renown. On
Monday afternoon a big fellow who goes

ST. PAUL., July 10.â The Great Northern
has given out to all of its agents not to
contract any freight for China destined to
the Interior points beyond Shanghai, Hong
kong and Canton, until conditions in that
empire have become more settled.
The Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific will feel, to some extent, the im
mediate effects of the Chinese anti-fore.gn
uprising. The trouble has already had a
tendency to disturb both Â«:ast and west
bound transpacific business. No Chinese
exports in the interior of the empire are
reaching the ccast cities destined for
the United States, and east-bound ships
must come with lighter cargoes in conse
quence. This means the two Pacific roads
leading into St. Paul will carry a reduced
quantity of Oriental imports, including
silks. With regard to silks, nearly every
boat up to date has brought as high as
four to six carloads of silks, valued at
from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. Some of this
silk is, of course, from Japan, but much
of it is from China.
A railroad official said to-day that the
Great Northern might temporarily lose
its trans-Pacific connections in case the
Chinese war reached an acute stage, '...he
Nippon Yusen Kalsha Steamship Com
pany, which operates In connection with

not be subject to' the same difficulty.

Judges Bahrs Enjoins Southern Pacific
Combination From Restoring
Old Tariff.
A second judgment in the Fresno rate
case was handed down by Judge Bahrs
yesterday and a*?ain the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company has been enjoined
from making further attempt to restore
the old rate of S3 SO for a single flrst-class
fare between this city and Fresno By
the judgment handed down yesterdav the
Southern Pacific Company i? prohibited
from charcrin? any hijrher rate than $3 73
for the fare between the two cities. It Is
claimed that this judgment is final and
that the railroad must yield to the law.
As Attorney General Ford was absent
from the city at the time the judgment
was rendered his office and that of the
Railroad Commission were represented by
Deputy Attorney General William M. Ab
bott and F. H. Short of Fresno. In dis
cussing the judgment of Judge Bahrs,
counsel for the people said in substance
that it would be claimed by the railroad
company that immediately upon the fil
ing and entering of the decree the judg
ment would b<? stayed until such time a3
the Supreme Court finally passed upon
the question. In support of this propo
sition, the attorneys for the railroad com
pany would argue that the order of the
Railroad Commission was mandatory In
form, requiring the company to take af
firmative action, namely: To immediately
restore the old rate of $3 75 for one con
tinuous passage one way between the cit
ies of San Francisco and Fresno. This
was upon the well settled doctrine that
an appeal from a mandatory order stays
the execution upon the order.
It was claimed by Attorney General
Ford and Mr. Short in behalf cf the Rail
road Commission that the decree as
signed by Judge Bahrs was not manda
tory, but prohibitive in form, and only
prohibited yrhe violation of the order cf
the Railroad Commission compelling the
railroad company to restore the old rate
of S-175; that the order of th e Railroad
Commission was final and conclusive and
could not be appealed from, and therefore
an appeal from the decree entered by
Judce Bahrs could not operate to stay
the final and non-appealablo judgment o'
the Railroad Commission, even though
that non-appea!able judgment be manda
tory. iÂ£Â£Â£ISÂ®gi

Assistant United States Attorney Wood
worth said that all the evidence taken be
fore th'? commission was in the printed
bill, ami he could not see how the railroad
companies could "get around it, the case
was sn plain. We will prosecute it for
all it Is worth." he said. "The points of
law involved are of great importance, and
the trial will be regarded with interest
all over the United States."
The bill asks the Circuit Court for a de
cree restraining the defendants from
charging th** said unlawful rates; also
that the defendants may be made to pay
not exceeding tV-so for every day after the
day named in the decree that they shall
fail to obey the Injunction, and for such
other and further relief us may appear
to the court to be necessary.
The proceedings in the present caso
were inaugurated in 1S0O by A. J. Gustin.
a citizen of Nebraska, and the case haa
drazff<=d its slow length alon^ ever since.
In Iv5 the interstate Commerce Com
mission tried the case, and after a thor
ough investigation arrived at the conclu
sion which forms thÂ° basis lor the pres
ent bill in equity. I>ast April the finish
ing touches were put upon the proceed
ings, and the iÂ«u*> is now fairly before
the court, whose decision will authorita
tively settle all the disputed points. The
bill is printed and makes rather a bulky
parr.phl-n. the greater part of which con
sists of exhibits.
The bill states that on May, 1S35, in the
town of Kearney, Nebr., it appeared to
the satisfaction of the Interstate Com
merce Commission after a hearing of the
case that the defendants had violated the
act to regulate commerce in that they
charged the rate of 77 cents per V*s pounds
on sugar in carload lots for the haul from
San .Francisco and other Pacitic Coast
common points over their joint lines to
Kearney, jN>br.. while at the same time
charging the rate of So csnta per 1D0
pounds on susar in carload lots for the
i-.aul over the same lines from Kearney
to Omaha. Nebr.. and that the rate on.
such shipments to Kearney, which ex
ceeds by more than 15 cents per W) pounds
the rate contemporaneously charged to
Omaha, is relatively unjust and unlawful.

emphatically disclaimed any such mocive

There is extreme jubilation in the camp
of the Santa Fe people. The joy devel
oped yesterday and was the result of a.
brief dispatch from Washington, D. C,
announcing a victory over the Southern
Pacific Company in connection with the
transportation of the supplies for the
Cnited States navy from Kastern ship
ping points to San Francisco. To the
casual observer this would appear to be
of no great consequence to the successful
bidder, but the quantity of freight
brought overland to this port and destined,
for the navy hero and elsewhere in Pacific
waters aggregates from 10,000 to 12.0X) tons
per month. Approximately this amounts
to 15O,(Â»i tons per year, requiring an im

The Toyo Risen Kaisha's Nippon Maru
was to have sailed for the Orient yester
day at 1 p. rn., but owing' to an accident
to her machinery she was delayed until
9:15 p. m.
The main steam tube was strained dur
ing the "'warming up" of the engines, and
steam had to shut off. The pipe was sent
to the Union Iron Works, where it had
to be brazed and then submitted to a
hydraulic test. Luckily the test was
satisfactory, or else the Nippon ilaru
would have remained in port until a new
brass pipe had been made. It will be
remembered that the transport Grant lay
for days at anchor waiting for a new
steam pipe, which met a similar fate to
the one on the Nippon Maru.

IT.
The Louvre possesses no less than thir
teen of Raphael's pictures. Of these works
the most celebrated is "La Beile Jardi
niere." which, however, does cot belong to
the artist's best period. The Virgin, seat
ed before a landscape background, watches
the infant Jesus, who stands by her side,
leaning- against her knee. At the right
kneels the child St. John, holding a cross.
The figures are about two-thirds life-size.
The other works by the great Italian
artist are: "The Virgin cf the Veil." "The
Holy Family, with St. Elizabeth and St.
John" (known in the catalogue as "La
Grande Sainte Famille de Francois I">.
another "Holy Family," "St. John the
Baptist in the wilderness." "St. Marga
ret," "St. Michael." "St. George and the
Dragon." "St. Michael Overcoming the
Demon" and four portraits, viz.. the por
trait of Balthasar Castiglior.e. the portrait
cf a young man. the portrait of Jeanne
d'Aragon, wife cf Prince Ascanio Colonna.
constable of the kingdom of Naples, and
the portraits of two men. The portrait of
a young man was for many years thought
to be the likness of Raphael himself. It
depicts a somewhat effeminate type of
character, life sizo. bust length, with long
hair and a black cap.
Of the "eighteen pictures by Titian there
will be occasion to allude to two or three
as of special excellence. First comes the
immortal picturo of. "The Entombment of
Christ," which is regarded by artists and
connoisseurs as one of the greatest paint-
Ings In the world. The body of the Christ,
wrapped in a shroud, is borne by Joseph
of Arimathea. Nicodamus and St. John. At
the left the Magdalen supports the Virgin
Mary. The figures are life size. Of the
other examples of Titian mention may be
made of the splendid "Jupiter and An
tiope" and of the portraits. Titian is com
ing to be ever more highly esteemed as a
psychological portrait painter.
Two famous works by Ccrreggto hang
in the square hall. They are "The Mysti
cal Marriage of St. Catharine" and "An
tiope." Of ,the other celebrated Italian
pictures In the same room let us cite Gior
gione's "Concert Champetrc." Ghir'.anda
jo's "Visitation," Lotai a "Salome." Tin
toretto's "Susannah," Solario's "Virgin of
the Cushion." etc.
The Dutch and Flemish schools arÂ«Â» very
v/ell reDresented In the Louvre. Some cf
"Fi?htin:r Gladiators." and the far-faired
"Victory" of Sanioihraee. Af:er these
may be mentioned the line Roman figure
known as "Polymnia." a draped "Venus"
attributed to Praxiteles, a "-Venn,* GÂ«?ne
trix." the '"Venus" of Arl^?. thÂ» "Venus"
of Troa_o. the "Pallas" of Velletri. a col.i*
sal "'Melpomene." a colossal lisure of the
"River Tib^r." UM "B<>n?h!Me Hermaphro
dite," a "Wounded Warrior." .a ""Disco
bolus." a "Centaur." a statue of "Jason"
and a large number of GreÂ«*k and Roman
Soda and goddesses and muncane heroes.

The museum of the Luxembourg, built
1S1S-20 and enlarged in 1S04, ha3 been suc
cessively a royal residence, a prison ari'l
a senate house, and it ta now the leadincj
national museum of m^em art. in whlcli
are stored ard exhibited the works of liv
ing painters and sculptors. The Frencfi
ministry of the fine arts buys each year
a certain number of works of art. rnor<Â»
especially statuary and fixtures, the mopt
important of which arÂ«? at first placed in
tbe Luxembourg. Eventually these work*
are distributed among the provincial
museums in the various cities and town'.
or. In the cases of especially valuable an<1
meritorious works, they may. ten years
after the death of their authors, be trans
ferred to the Louvre for permanent ex
hibition, thus constituting, in a way. thÂ»
apotheosis of the fortunate artists.
The collections in the Luxembourg ar-Â»
of rive classes, viz: 1. Paintings. 2.
Sculptures. 3. Drawinsr**. 4. Engravings.
3. Lithoerraphs. The mq3t Interesting of
the collections usually i? that of sculp
tures. !n which the modern French school
is pre-eminent. The French occupy a po
sition of entire isolation in this depart
ment of art. and up to the present tim*
they have had no rivals. Th* works of
Chanu. Duboin. Rude. Barye. Fremiet.
Jouffroy. Falsuiere. Barriaa. CarpÂ«?aux
and Duret have passed throusrh the Lux
embourg stage of their progress or arÂ»
still serving there their apprenticeship,
preliminary to their final graduation ami
promotion into the Louvre. Outside of
th<* Luxembourg, also, in the adjacent
jnrde-n. are to be found the beautiful
"Fountain of the Medicis" by De Brr<*3.Â».
and a s:reat number of statues by Ger

NEW YORK. July 10.â The stock market was
rather dull to-day, but compared with yes
terday's semi-Etagnatlon It had an effect of
considerable animation. The large Increases in
prices of stocks which resulted from the com
paratively small deallr.gÂ» are evidences of the
small floating supply of stocks now offering
In the market. The opening dealings were on
an extremely Fir.all scale, but 1hz market
gained strength and volume as the day pro-
Krtwed. The railmad stocks were especially
well taken, but the Industrials and specialties
had their full share In the strength of the
day's market. The list of securities dealt in
f-howed a considerable lengthening over that
for some time past. A number of factors co
operated to cause the advance in prices. The
excellent rerlstance offered yesterday in face
of the violent decline and heavy liquidation in
Brooklyn Transit was in itself a motive for
advancing prices on the part of professional
t nufl^rs, whow constsnt &im Is to scâ¬ priot*s
move and who only need to see the impos
sibility demonstrated of a movement In one
direction to start a mqvement In another di
rection. The conviction that the monthly crop
report would show a. material improvement in
the conditions not only in the spring wheat
wheat belt but In those portions of the winter
whfat l*lt which had suffered from too much
rain played a large part in the day's advance
and larce short lines were covered In the
stocks of all the grain-carrrying roads. The
vociferous alarm over the corn crop professed
by pome of the crop experts was evidently
viewed with skepticism by Wall street and the
corn-carrying grangers shared in the general
strength. The more cheerful tone in the for
eign markets in response to the better news
from China had a larger Influence in this mar
ket than npus frcm that source has had pre
viously. The better tone in Berlin was es
pecially marked and doubtless the buying back
accounted for the special strength of the Pa
cifies and other Berlin favorites. The con
tinued drain on the gold resources of the Bank
of England causes surmise as to the possi
bility of gold going* from New York this week.
but a rise in sterling at Paris to-day showed
a relaxation of the principal strain on the
EnKlich market. Stocks clostd ciulet-and firm
r.car the top.
The bond market was slightly more active
than yesterday, but was Irregular.

NEW YORK, July 10.â Special cable and tele

the last account: Wheatâ United States and
Canada, east of the Rockies (Liverpool Corn
Trade News), increase 540,000 bushels; afloat
for and In Europe, decrease 6,700.000 bushels;
total supply, decrease 6,160.000. Cornâ United
States and Canada, east of the Rockies. In
crease 2,33?,000 bushels. Oats â United States
and Caiiada, cast of the Rockies, decrease 71 -
000 bushels.
Note.â The immense decrease In afloat for
and In Kurope 13 due- to monthly revisions.
Broomhall cables that stocks on July 1 came
out smaller than expected nearly everywhere.
The aggregate stock of wheat held at Port
land, Or., and Tncoma and Seattle, Wash., de
creased 78.000 bushels last week.
WHEATâ Liverpool reported rather more de
mand, with an advance of 3d on passage. Paris
was lower.
Chicago was weak, cables being disappointing.
Corn was lower on showers in the West. The
working of 200.000 bushels of Wheat for export,
coupled with Urartstreet's estimate of a largely
decreased visible supply, caused some strength.
Th'.-re was no activity, however, as everybody
hold off for thj Government report, which was
expected to be bullish.

CHICAGO. July 10.â All the session the
njÂ°nthly Government report, due after the
close, Etood ns a successful barrier to specu
lative operations in grain. In wheat there was
the 1 narrowest margin in weeks. September
opened T^c to JfiHie under vestcrday at SOWc
to 73TÂ»c. and sold off to 73-NiC soon after. Until
the concession in price could be made there
was practically no demand. The occasion of
the shrinkage in values over night was on
heavy receipts at Liverpool, which resulted in
a, decline of 't@l!i,c at that market. Corn
was also weak and this had a depressing effect.
Tho close was barely t-teady, " s c under yes
terday at SO^c. The trade throughout was
mostly nibbling for small profits by scalpers.
Corn wan moderately active, but nervous in
the face of the approaching Government report.
Rains in Kansas and other parts of the corn
belt had an effe>-t in depressing the price.
September closed -V fil^c under yesterday.
Oats were quiet i>i<l relatively steadier than
the other grain markets. September closed
down.
Provisions were weak, influenced by large
hog receipts, easiness at the yards and the

to the statistician of the Department of Ag
riculture on the acreage of corn planted in
dicate an lncreaFe of about 1,2=30,000 acres, or
1.3 per cpnt over the acreage harvested last
year. The increaa* in acreage is, in the main,
well distributed, there being only ten States
and Territories out of the forty-five reporting
that have not a larger acreage planted than
was harvested last year. The average con
ditions of the Browing; crop Is 89. 5. as com
pared with E6.5 on July 1, 1SSS, 90.3 at the
corresponding date In 1S3S and a ten-year aver
age of 90.7.
The condition <of winter wheat shows a
further decline during June, being SO. 8 on
July 1, as compared with S2.7 on June 1, 63.6
on July 1, 1839, &5.7 at the corresponding date
In 1898. and a ten-year average of 79.8. All
the Important winter wheat States except
Pennsylvania. Texas and Tennessee, share In
this Improvement of condition. Ohio and In
diana falling to 23 and Michigan to 40.
The average condition of spring wheat Is 53.2.
as compared with 67.3 one month ago, 91.7 on
July 1, 1SE9. 35 at the corresponding date in
1(>?8. and a ten-year average of SS.5. The con
dition in Minnesota has fallen to 45 and in
South Dakota to 44 and in North Dakota to 20,
these figures being 44. 43 and B0 points re
spectively below the ton-year average for the
States named. The Northwestern States have
been visited by a special agent of the de
partment within the last ten days and the re
ports of the department's regular correspond
ents are fully confirmed.
In Minnesota and North Dakota the condi
tion of oats, barley, rye, pasture and meadow
lands Is much like the showing of wheatâ the
lowest on record.
The condition of spring and winter wheat
combined on July 1 was C3.8, against 67.2 on
July 1, 1S99, and S9.4 at the corresponding date
in 1Â«9S.
The amount of wheat remaining In the hands
of farmers on July 1 Is estimated at about
El. 000,000 bushels, or the equivalent of 9.3 per
cent of the crop of 1S99.

S3. 5, as compared with 91. 7 one month ago. 90
on July 1, 1S99, and a ten-year average of 87. 3.
The average condition of barley Is 76.3. as
against Â£6.2 one month ago, 92 on July 1 issa
85.7 at the corresponding date in JS9S and a

barley States show a decline durlntr the- month
and their averages of condition are below the
respective ten-year averages.
The average condition of winter rye is 89 6
as compared with 83.3 on July 1, 1S93, 93. g ' a [
the corresponding date In 1S68 and a ten-year
average of S9.3.
Reports on the hay crop are in the main
unfavorable and there are few Important graz
ing States In which the condition is not con
siderably below the ten-year average.
While there has been a general decline In
the condition of apples almost every Important
apple-growing State has the promise of more
than an average crop. This is also true of
peaches and grapes.
The wool report Indicates the average weight
per fleece as being 6. 17 pounds, as against 5 1)5
pounds in 1S99. , .

forty-two vessels, with a carrying capacity of
128,000 tons. There are only ten of these due
here before Septmber 1. There are thirty-eight
vessels listed for Hawaiian Islands, with about
74.0Ci> tons of coal. Freight rates are quoted at

Newcastle, and tonnage hard to procure at

delivered from ship's side with dispatch, thus
none Is yarded, leaving no reserve to draw

yet they are unable to fill the orders as they
come In. The Immense demand this year for
Alaska has called Into requisition all the avail

of steamers for here. It is difficult to predict
where thÂ» combined navies of the world, which
will shortly center fn. China waters, will draw

jH. jM. jNORJfl WEDS
dertake the collection of rates In excess of those
prescrilM-d by the ordinance they would be re
sisted at every point hy the consumers of wa
ter, and thus be driven to Innumerable actions
at law. Hesldes, should they, in any Instance,
succeed In collecting, without an action, a
higher rate than the ordinance prescribes. It
Is equally certain that they would thereby
bring upon themselves protracted and heavy
litigation, having for Its object forfeiture of
their entire system of works. Surely these in
juries are Irreparable, and actions at law, so
far as from being adequate to the exigencies
of the situation, are. as complainants In their
brief forcibly put it, 'mere mockeries of a
remedy.' "
Judge Hart quoted Justice McKenna on
the question of a bond to protect rate
payers, nnd said he had no doubt a prop
erfy conditioned bond would secure the
consumers. He added:
There Is not the slightest doubt in my mind
about this; and, it being true, the rights of all
parties to this litigation will certainly be am
ply protected by an order for a preliminary
Injunction. The equity presented by the uncon
tradlcted affidavits unquestionably entitles
plaintiff to this temporary relief. It does not
necessarily follow, however, that the state
ments alleged In the affidavit of Watklnson
to have been made by the members of the eald
Council are true. They may be successfully
controverted at the trtal; but, as I have here
tofore said, standing unlmpeaehed by counter
affidavits in this Interlocutory proceeding, the
showing Is, In my opinion, clearly sufficient to
warrant the action of the court.
Attorney Hayne Insisted upon a $100,000
bond, but not until a squabble with At
torneys Moore and McCutcheon as to the
amount was his figure accepted by the
court. The Injunction goes Into effect as
soon as the water company's sureties
have been approved.
to wit: The plaintiff herein and the Oak
land Water Company: that, after a spirited
competition Tor some time, a combination
was effected between them, that Is. the
Oakland Water Company was merged m:o
the Contra Costa Water Company.
An Important question arises here. It is
Incumbent upon the plaintiff to show, '.y
a satisfactory preponderance of evidence,
that all the property to which it refers In
us complaint Is essential for the supplying
of water to the city of Oakland and its
Inhabitants, etc. If It should thus fail to show
that It was Incapable of supplying the city
and Its inhabitants with water Independent
of the Oakland Water Company's plant,
etc then In that event, the latter could
not be considered as one of the elements
upon which the measure of compensation
should be based.
It will thus be seen that It Is oulte mate
rial to the case that all of the facts which
may be contained in any books, documents,
etc. of the plaintiff which relate to Its
property, its capacity to furnish water pre
vious to Its consolidation with the Oakland
Water Company and Its capacity since, and
all other matters throwing any light upon
Its facilities for transacting the businesa
for which it was organized are indeed very
material not only to the issues generally but
to the defense of the suit.
It Is unnecessary to take up seriatim the
numerous specifications contained In the
moving; papers, but It is sufficient to say
that a careful examination of the plead
ings and the specifications convinces me that
the defendants should be accorded the right
to examine not only the books containing
the receipts, showing the revenue derived,
the books containing the operating expenses,
the books containing; the cost of construc
tion, etc., but also any and all other books
which may disclose the actual amount of
property of all kinds and the uses to which
It has been put referred to In thÂ« complaint
as constituting the plant of plaintiff.
THE Contra Costa Water Company's
application for an Injunction to
restrain an enforcement of the
water rates fixed for this year
has been granted, as predicted by
The Call, by Superior Judge Hart. The
order, made to-day, In effect, accord
ing to the water company's attorneys,
wipes the present water rate ordinance off
the books. It leaves the city without a
rate pending the trial and gives the water
company the extraordinary privilege of
charging any rate it shall please, without
interference by the city or by any rate
payer.
President J. H. T. Watkinson and Wil
liam J. Dingee of the water company de
clared as soon as Judge Hart had signed
the order that they would immediately
proceed to collect upon the rates of last
year's ordinance. They claimed flatly
that this ordinance was now In effect, be
cause the Injunction had swept aside,
temporarily, at least, the rates over
which suit has been brought.
The injunction, which has so sweeping
an effect upon the ratepayers of Oakland,
will stand unJ the final settlement of thÂ«
litigation, unless the counsel for the cuy
shall secure an immediate hearing on ap
peal to the Supreme Court and b. favor
able opinion there. The first step to that
end was taken by Attorney Hayne when
he made an exception to the order, as
eoon as Judge Hart had delivered his
opinion. That opinion is based almost en
tirely upon the aflidavit of President J. H.
T. Watklnson, who quotes purported In
terviews with Councilmen bearing upon
the manner of fixing the. rates.
Under the terms of the decision the or
dinance stands as an invalid and Illegal
law. Of course, his Is only a one-sided
aspect of the situation. The injunction
rests upon this phase of the case, how
ever, and It simply and plainly gives into
the hands of the Contra Costa Water
Company all that the corporation has
been trying to secure since this suit was
brought. .
The water company was given a rate
this year about 25 per cent lower than
laÂ«t year's figures. Its putt is to annul
this year's ordinance. That has already
been accomplished by this injunction pro
ceeding, and the rate-payers apparently
have no redress. The company will com
mence to collect rates under the old ordi
nance to-morrow.
The attorneys for the city have not de
cided what move will next be made. The
City Attorney's office is of the opinion
that the former ordinance lapsed of Itself
on June 30, and that the water company
must wait until the suit Is determined
before It can collect rates.
The order of restraint goes much fur
ther than to merely prevent the city from
enforcing the lower rates. It specifically
declares that injunction is against inter
ference with the company "for collecting
rates otherwise than as established by
said ordinance."
The opinion of Judge Hart shows how
effectively the water company has fas
tened itpelf upon the rate-payers of Oak
land. The very opening sentence of the
opinion says: "This Ib a motion for an
order pending the determination of this
eult, and until the rendition of final Judg
ment herein."
judge Hart says:
This application Is based upon certain affi
davits and the pleadings in the case. It Is
alleged In the complaint, among other things,
that the ordinance which is the subject of this
litigation has fixed the maximum rates at
which water must be furnished by the- plaintiff
to the city of Oakland and Its Inhabitants so
low as to prevent the plaintiff from deriving
â¢ rrÂ»a*onr.blo and Just comiu'iisation for the
ANTICIPATION AND REALIZATION REGARDING THE WATER COMPANY'S BOOKS. i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1113 Broadway. July 10.
An early hearing of Horace W. Phil
brook's application to be appointed
guardian of the Merritt children was de
nied this morning by Judge Ellsworth a
point thus being scored against Horaeo
W. Phllbrcok. Phtlbrook opposed a con
tinuance, and when he saw that It was
inevitable urged that the cases be set for
as early a date as possible. There wa*
considerable legal sparring before Attor
ney Emll Nusbaumer was successful In
his motion for a continuance.
When the application for guardianship
of the Merritt children was called by
Judge Ellsworth this morning Attorney
V,'. B. Boseley stated that he appeared aj
the representative of Frederick A. Meirut
and his children. He said that he had
been served on June IS with a notice that
an amended petition for guardianship
would be filed, but not until yesterday
afternoon was he handed a copy of the
a mended 1 petition. The petition, he de
clared, was a voluminous document, con
taining 1 much scandalous and Immaterial
matter, to which he had not had time to
prepare an answer. He asked for a con
tinuance on these groundsi.
Before passim? upon Attorney Bosc'ey'*
request Judge Ellsworth wanted to know
if the application for the guardianship of
James P. Merritt could not be heard at
the same time. Philbrook said nay, aa
there were separate Issues Involved.
Here Attorney Emll Nusbaumer inter
posed, saying:
"Mr. Frick and I appear on behalf of
James P. Merritt and his two minor chil
dren. Our position Is the same as that 'f
Mr. Boseley. Some time ago I was seived
with a copy of an amended petition, but it
differed from that filed Saturday. I had
prepared an answer to the document left
with me. but have not had time to answer
the one filed."
"How Is It. Mr. Phflhrook. that there are
two amended petitions?" asked the court.
In explanation Philbrook stated that
when he served Attorney Nusbaumer with
the amended petition he was prepared to
go on with the case, but since then he had
secured additional Information and had
made some changes In the petition.
Judge Ellsworth remarked that it was
not unreasonable to ask for a continuance,
as Attorney Nusbaumer could not be ex
pected to prepare an answer to sa-jh a
lengthy document within two days. Con
sidering the bulk of the document, hÂ«j said.
It must contain a great amount of imma
terial matter.
"I think It no more than right that this
case should go over until after the sum
mer vacation," said Xusbaumer. "Gravo
charges are made against my partner.
Gf-orge W. Reed, and I think he should be
given an opportunity to answer theso
scandalous accusations."
"He has had plenty of time to answer."
retorted Philbroo'k. "I have served him
with a subpoena requiring him to appear
in this case."
""iou served him on the 'eve of huÂ» tie
parture for the East," answered Attorney
Nusbaumer.
The argument was shortened by Juds:e
Ellsworth, who continued the hearing of
both petitions until July 31. The court de
elated that the attorneys for the accused
were certainly entitled to time to answer
the cliatges made against them.

poses:
ThÂ« Carmen's Social and Benevolent Society
Includes In Us membership nearly 5fiO men. all
conductors and motormen employed on the
lines of the street car companies of Alameda
County. The society was organized two years
bro last February by eight or ten street car
men. who constituted the nucleus for what has
since developed Into one of the most Influential
poclal and beneficial ' societies In the State.
It has been a godsenl to scores of men work
ing on the cars. It has relieved the wants of
many wives and children. It has given the
men protection. In cases of sickness cr death
among them It has paid their doctor's bills
or jriven them fitting burial.
The carmen have been drawn Into closer fel
lowship through the society. Harmony pre
vails where formerly there was discord. Men
have been helpefl Into positions. -They have
confidence In themselves.
Weekly meetings are held where the men
gather to transact their business and enjoy a
social hour or two. free from evil Influence and
associates. For the nominal sum of 50 cents a
month a member is entitled tt> a $6 weekly sick
benefit. The death benefit Is 173. In case the
amount allowed by the laws of the society Is
not sufficient to relieve a member from distress
he Is voted an additional rum.
In a financial way the society has been ex
ceptionally fortunate, havlngr on hand at pres
ent a large surplus. It Is the purpose to *rect
a building In the near future. If the public Is
as liberal In the patronage of the society*! balls
and entertainments In the future aa It has been
In the past. It Is only a question of a short time
when the scheme will be realized.
The watchwords of the society are charity
and unity and it Is the endeavor of the mem
bers to live up to them. Each m#mber wears
a button with an embossed car upon It In the
lapel of Ms coat. i
The officers of the Oakland Transit Compmy
have shown their good will toward ths society
by aiding it In Its various undertakings.

E. C. HART.
Judge of the {Superior Court. Presiding
in Department Three.
, Dated July 10, A. U im
OAKI^AXD, July 10.â If the Contra
Costa Water Company has any rec
ords, books or accounts not in the
ash pile, they are now open to the
inspection of the city's experts. Judge
Hart to-day granted, as predicted by The
Call, the motion of Attorney Hayne in
that regard. The significant statement
was made by Attorney McCutcheon. for
the water company, that "such books as
the company has would be produced"â a
very significant remark.
In granting permission to Inspect the
books, Judge Hart salu:
As I etated from the bench on the day
upon which this hearing was had, the show
ing here made, considered In connection
with the allegations of the pleadings and
the Issues thereby made. Is sufficient to
authorize an order for an inspection of the
books, records and documents enumerated
In the demand.
It is my opinion that the description of
the books, etc.. desired to be Inspected, is as
specific and accurate as It was In the power
of the defendants to make In the moving
papers; in fact, it would be Impossible to
make a more definite description.
As to the materiality of the records and
accounts of which Inspection Is demanded.
It seems clear to meâ assuming, as I have a
right to, from the very nature of things,
that the plaintiff keeps books In which are
recorded Its transactions and the property
of all kinds and description used In connec
tion with the operation of Its businessâ that
the Issues In this cane necessarily show that
such books contain evidence that bears dl
r*K2t!y upon the questions to be determined
in this cause. For Instance. It is alleged
that at one time there were two separate
and distinct water companies competing
against each other In the city of Oakland.
Judge Hart Makes Two Very Important Orders in the Oakland
Water-Rate Case, in Which the City Loses and Wins.
same. The answer denies seriatim all the ma
terial allegations of the complaint. It is con
tended by the defendant that, where the unswer
denies all the equltlfa of the eomnlalnt, the
court is not authorized to grant an order for
an injunction pendente lite. On the other
hand. It is claimed that where there is a show
ing, independent of the pleadings, that a party
will suffer Irreparable injury pending the de
termination of the questions Involved In the
litigation, unless the act complained of is re
strained. It is not only within the power, but
that It is tfce duty of the court to grant an in
junction pendente lite.
It was also argued by counsel that the de
fendants were in no way concerned In the en
forcement of the terms of the ordinance, and
that,- therefore, there Is no occasion for any
res train Inn? order against them; that the power
and duty of the city ended with the passage of
the ordinance. '
There Is no doubt of the correctness of the
rule stated by counsel that, where the answer
denies all the equities of the bill, there can be
no injunction, except in canes of special clr
cunistances, or where an Injunction Is granted
without notice upon the filing of a complaint,
and an answer ia afterward filed, denying all
the equities of the complaint, that the Injunc
tion will be dissolved on motion. But where
a sufficient showing: by affidavit or otherwise
is made, independent of the pleadings, the case
does not come within the rule Just stated.
So far as the matters contained In affidavits
on Hie herein are concerned, the defendants
made no counter showing, and rested their re
sistance to this application upon the pleadings
and the sufficiency of said affidavits. The af
fidavit of J. II. T. Watklnson, president of the
plaintiff, sets forth statements alleged to have
been made over the signatures of ten members
of the City Council, nine of whom voted for the
ordinance In question, to the effect that the
ordinance had been voted for and passed by
said Council without any Investigation having
been previously made of the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of the rates fixed thereby. In
other words, assuming the facts set forth in
this affidavit to be true, which, for purposes of
this motion I am of the opinion that I am com
pelled to do, in the absence of any counter
showing, the board arbitrarily fixed the rates
without any consideration of the rights of the
plaintiff in the premises.
It does not follow, however, that because no
notice is necessary the board are for that rea
son excused from applying to corporations or
individuals Interested to obtain all Information
necessary to enable It to act Intelligently and
fairly in the fixing of rates. This Is its plain
duty and a failure to make the proper effort
to procure all necessary information, from
whatever source, may defeat Its action. Both
the corj>orat!on and the Individuals furnishing
the water, as well as the public who must pay
for Its use, are entitled to a careful and honest
effort on the part of the board to obtain such
Information and to have It act accordingly.
(Spring Valley Water Works, Respondent, vs.
City and County of San FYanclsco et al., ap
pellants, S2 Cal.. page 316.)
As to the point that the city and Its Council
are not enforcing the ordinance, an answer Is
found In the language of I'nlted States District
Judge Welborn of the Southern District of Cal
ifornia in his opinion in the case of Los An
geles City Water Company vs. City of Los
Anceles, ns follows: "It is idle to say that
relief cannot be had In equity because the
power and duty of the city ended with the
passing of the ordinance and no effort Is now
bÂ»Mng made by the city for its enforcement.
The ordinance, by reason of the severe pains
and penalties which apparently fortify It. Is
daily, hourly and momentarily enforcing Itself.
The defendants must either submit to the terms
of the ordinance or incur unusually onerous
expenditures. It is reasonably certain that If,
with the ordinance standing, they were to un-
CANNOT INFORCE WATER RATES,
BUT CAN EXAMINE THE BOOKS
Oakland Office San Frand?co Call,
1113 Broadway. July 10.
An armed guard patrols to-night thÂ»
Â¦walks In front of the residence of Charles
R. Allen, the wholesale coal merchant, at
the sni>thwest corner of Lake and Oak
streets. The place is In the exclusive
Lakeside- district, and the situation has
elements of mystery about it which vtvid-
Iy recall the strange episode that created
no end of excitement at the same house
some months ago.
It is suspeuKd that the mysterious ax
wielder who made a murderous attack at
this same place upon Henry K. Belden,
the prominent insurance man, is again
abroad in the land, and has selected for
another strange assault this same local
ity. Who the man with the ax N the
police have never been able to discover.
They have additional reason to wonder
over the exciting circumstances of an en
counter which occurred at midnight last
night at the Allen residence.
A company of Chinese house servants,
two of whom are employed by the Aliens,
were returning from a trip to Chinatown.
Shortly before midnight they separated,
the Allen servants leaving their compan
ion on Oak street Just below the corner of
Lake. They then started to enter the
house and go to bed when one of them
espied a moving figure In the shadowy
light from an electric lamp across the
way. The figure was that of a man. He
was carrying what appeared to resemble
an ax.
As the two Chinese walked up the stde
entrance to the house they were seen by
the mysterious prowler, who suddenly
turned away from the door and ran
toward them. The startled Mongols fled,
instead of trying to get into the house.
They alarmed the police by their cries,
but the intruder had disappeared with
his weapon before any of the posse of
blue-coats were at hand.
The frightened servants were sent home
under police escort after they had run
several blocks from the house. A close
search of the neighborhood was made,
but no trace of the mysterious ax enr
rler was found. It was believed he had
made his way through the thick under
growth and trees alonj? the edpes of Lak'i
Merritt, the banks of which run along the
opposite side of the street from the Allen
residence. The police are nonplussed over
the Incident. The Allans are equally in
the dark concerning the strange visitor,
and the Lakeside district \s agog with ex
citement over the supposed reappearance
of this uncanny "man with the ax."
The Allen residence is isolated. It lsÂ» one
of the most attractive places In the ex
clusive fashionable section of the city.
Much prominence hns been Riven to the
locality because of the strange mMnlsrht
Belden episode. Shortly after that oc
curred the Beldens cave up the home
â¢which they had beautified at no little out
lay. It has h*en occupied by the Aliens
for nearly a ye.'ir. Because of last night's
occurrence, an-1 at the desire of the Al
iens, an armed watchman has been sta
tioned there to surprise and capture the
unknown should he make another visit to
the place.
Policeman Schumer, who has been
working on the case, stated to-nl^ht that
he was satisfied that the man who at
tacked the Allen residence answers the
description of the mysterious* man with
the ax who attacked the house several
months ago.

Loss of sight of one eye, with the other

lads about his own age, at hla home. The
Burke youth had a cap pistol, and it was
the discharge of this apparently harm
less weapon which caused the serious ac
cident to young Kiel. Burke exploded a
cap while pointing the little weapon at
Kiel. A flashing bit of the paper wad
ding blew into Kiel's right eye with such
force that it penetrated the eyeball.
Dr. BrinckerhofT was called to attend
the injured lad and removed the obstruc
tion, but it is believed that the injury to
the delicate organ is so serious that the
sight has been permanently destroyed.
The other eye has been affected sympa

the sight will be lost.

United States Coast and Geodetic Survey-
For N. K. Masten an assessment of
$1550 on Lake Tahoe Railway stock was
canceled, the corporation being domestic
and its stock non-assessable.
A large number of petitions for reduc
tions of assessments in small amount were
acted upon. The board will meet again
this afternoon at 1:30 o'clock to continue
the work of equalization.
Caldwell is the warehouseman who
gave partial testimony, but refused
to give information as to the merchants
Â¦who had goods In his warehouses or as to
the value and nature of those goods. Al
though it was supposed that he had Chi
nese merchandise valued at $2,000,000 in U'p
two warehouses, he swore that at noon on
the first Monday in March he had no
solvent creditsâ that not a dollar was due
him from any of the merchants.
Assessor Dodge brought suit before Jus
tice Barry to enforce the penalty of $100
against Caldwell for refusing to testify
before .the Assessor, but the suit was lost
on a technicality.
"I am convinced," Assessor Dodge said
to the board, "that this is only a test case.
If this man is allowed to establish his
point in refusing to let us know the value
of the goods in his warehouses and the
names of the merchants who own the
goods, so that we can discover his solvent
credits, next year all warehousemen will
follow suit and millions of dollars will be
lost from 'the assessment rolls. If my
penalty of an arbitrary assessment Is up
held he and the rest of them will testify
next year, as In the past."
The petition was denied and the assess
ment of $10,000 stands^ . '
The assessment of $15,000 against C. A.
Warren of Warren & Malley was can
celed, Assessor Dodge agreeing that
solvent credits from the Pair estate to
that amount were offset by liabilities' to
the San Francisco Bridge Company.
In answer to a query, Attorney Acker
man said his corporation would consider
$20,000 a fair assessment/ Assessor Dodge
agreed that his assessment had been too
high. Supervisor Reed said the company
had kept faith with the city and was en
deavoring to give the people dollar gas
and that It ought to receive fair treat
ment in the matter of assessment. The
board voted to reduce the assessment , to
$20,000.
A. B. Caldwell, owner of the Pioneer and
Lombard warehouses, asked to have the
arbitrary assessment of $10,000 on his busi
ness reduced, claiming that he had given
testimony to Assessor Dodpe, and that the
assessment was not legally an arbitrary
one, hence was subject to reduction by tho
board.
The Supervisors met yesterday after
noon as a Board of Equalization, and
among a large number of small assess
ments acted upon three of considerable
importance. The assessment of the fran
chise of the Alaska Packers* Association
was left unchanged at 5600,000. The Equit
able Gas Light Company's franchise was
cut from $100,000 to $20,000. The arbitrary
assessment of $10,000 on the Pioneer and
Lombard warehouses was sustained by
the board.
By its action in allowing Assessor
Dodge's assessment in the Alaska Pack
ers' Association to stand the board went
on record in favor of the Assessor's pol
icy of compelling intangible forms of
property to bear a larger proportion of
the burden of taxation. The Packers' As
sociation has given warning that it may
be compelled to leave San Francisco and
make Seattle Its distributing point and
place of business, and Supervisor Comte
argued that taxing the franchises of pri
vate corporations would drive trade away
from San Francisco, but nine of the
eleven Supervisors present approved As
sessor Dodge's policy.
Henry F. Fortmann, president of the as
sociation, was present to give testimony
and, W. H. Chickering to make the argu
ment. Former Mayor Pond, one of the
chief stockholders, was also present, but
did not testify.
Fortmann testified that the association
makes purchases annually of Jl.500,000
worth of goods produced in California and
emplovs 5000 men. It makes San Fran
cisco its distributing point for the world.
For this year the total taxes will be over
$43 000. President Fortmann called atten
tfon to the fact that of its two principal
competitors the franchise of one is as
sessed at $5000 and the other at $2a00. He
said his company had expressed its will
ingness to pay taxes on a franchise as
sessment of $50,000.
"This is the inevitable conflict that
arises " said Assessor Dodge, "when It
is proposed to tax intangible forms of
property that is highly remunerative. The
question is whether real estate and per
sonal property are to bear the brunt of
taxation or whether other forms shall
had prepared state
ments of the financial condition of the
Packers' Association, showing that the
annual dividends of $9 per share amount
ed to $432,000. The tax on the franchise
assessment of $600,OW. a little over SSWOtf.
would amount to but eighteen cents per
share annually. In Alaska- the company
pa\s taxes amounting to $33,924, which at
$160 per $100 equals the. tax on $2,081,250.
The market value of the association's
stock at $116 is $5,676,000, go that there is
$3,594,750 of stock value on which no tax
is paid anywhere. If, to be more fair, the
paid up value of stock. $3,120,000. is taken,
there is still $l,03S,750 on which no tax is
P Attorney Chickering protested that the
corporation's taxes this year In Alaska,
Washington and California would aggre
gate $43,000, which would equal a fair tax
rate on the paid-up value of its Btock, the
only fair basis of computation.
After argument at length, the board
took the assessment under consideration.
"It must be remembered," Supervisor
Comte said, "that such assessment may
drive away capital. We are trying to build
up our trade and make San Francisco a
great city, and It would be wise for us
to be careful in taxing franchises of
private corporations heavily. I move that
we reduce this assessment to $250,000.
Supervisor Connor paid It ought to be
raised to $1,000,000. After further discus
sion the board voted to let the $600,000
assessment stand. Supervisors Booth.

Charles L. Ackerman appeared for the
Equitable Gas Light Company and asked
that the assessment of Us franchise be
reduced from $100,000. He Eaid that the
company had not yet paid a dollar in div
idends. Its receipts were now about $2000
per month, and the company was p.utting
that and $10,000 or $12,000 each month more
into extending the plant. If earning
capacity was to be considered ' a. $100,000
franchise assessment was much too high.

called on several of the sailor boariiing

to collect the license tax. The keepers
claim that they do not make contracts to
supply help to vessel:?, but that they keep
boarding houses and are subject to the
license tax imposed on that business.,
.Scott is Investigating the law on the
subject and may go before the Supervis

that the license be rescinded on account
of the dliUculty of collecting it. There
are but ten or twelve snilor boarding

To those of nerve and etrons of hand.

To golden courses milled and mined.

Hear far the miners' Joyous cry
Ab nolnt of rilck turns back the sod
'Neatli which the gllst'ning nuggets

Find fickle Fortune's long sought

And revel in the boundless wealth
That's ever been his ltfelong dream.

is $125 per cord; coal $10 per. sack.
Miss Moore says that there is far more
money to be made at Dawson City than
at Nome. A stenographer at the former
place can make $1 per hour.
GOVERNMENT MAY AID
STRANDED GOLD-SEEKERS
"WASHINGTON, July 10.â Treasury of
ficials from information from various
sources during the last two week3have
reason to believe that there will be over
10,000 stranded fortune hunters In Nome
when navigation closes this. fall and that
steps should be taken to bring theee peo
ple back to the states so they will not
have to endure the hardships 'and suffer
ings bound to come next winter. The
question* with the officials of the treas
ury is what shall be done and what can
be done by the Government to prevent
this before It Is too late.
â¢The rush continues to Nome and ships
enough cannot be provided to bring these
people back before navigation closes un
less steps are taken immediately to pro
vide for this. Inquiry will be made at
Pacific ports at once to determine what
vessels are available should it be decided
to dispatch a relief fleet, and an estimate
obtained of the probable cost of such an
expedition.

NOT TO BE TOLERATED
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., July 10.â
Tho steamship Ohio arrived here to-night
from Nome with eighty pasengers. The
Ohio was quarantined on her arlval at
Nome on account of a number of cases of
smallpox among the passengers. She will
remain her<i until morning for quarantine
inspection. It is probable that she will be
sent to the quarantine for fumigation on
account of the fact that she could not be
fumigated In the north. No one was al

Terrible Death, of a Prospector.
The St. Paul brings particulars of the
horrible death of a man named John
Bacon while on the trail. Ho was In search
of the new El Dorado and fell by the way
side. His remains were discovered while
the St. Paul was* lyinp in the open road-
Ftead and caused considerable comment.
A diary was found on his body and the
following transcript of its contents is
taken from the Nome Gold Digger:

A Little Shooting Incident.
A few hours before the St. Paul pulled
tip anchor and started for San Francisco
there was a very lively shooting scrape.
Shooting affairs were anything but unus
ual, but this particular one created great
excitement, and had it not been for the
Foldiers there would have been a riot.
Joe Hayne of the Alaska. Commercial
THE ST. PAUL ARRIVES IN PORT AND DISCHARGES NOME PASSENGERS.
Company was in charge of the concern's
property as nightwatchman. During an
off hourâ there is no night there these
months â a man named Lucas attempted
to jump the company's claim, and Hayne
at once opened tire. The claim-jumper
replied and Hayne was struck in the
stomach. His next shot went through
Lucas' brain, and the last named dropped
dead. Hayne then emptied the remaining
barrels of his revolver into the body of
his fallen foe a.nd dropped dead beside
him. The followers of the two men took
sides, and only the arrival of tho soldiers
prevented a riot.
"Lucky" Raid win was down on his
luck when the St. Paul sailed. Land for
liis famous dance house could not be pro
cured and rivals in the busineFs wero
stealing all his dance girls. When last
seen "Lucky" was standing up to a bar
and paying- two bits a drink for plain,
ordinary Cape Kome whisky. 'Â¦

The following laconic informa.tlon of the
killing of a man is from the Nome Gold
Digger:
Chief of Police Iteddy has received a letter
from Chief of Pnllre Sullivan. SÂ«n Francisco,

Epidemic Predicted.
"There will be a fenrful epidemic at
Nome this fall." said Dr. Z. T. Mallaby
on the ?t. Paul yesterday. "There are
about lifteen miles or tents along the
beach, and it is as much as a man's life
Is worth for an outsider to venture among
thf-m. There is absolutely no Â«anitation
and when the swamp begins to dry up the
men will <11Â« like flies In summer from ty
phoid fever. Dawson In its worst days
cnuld not compare with Nome, and the
thought of the wretchedness that will
prevail there next winter is enough to
make a. man shudder.
"There are at least 30,000 people up there
and how 20.000 of them are going to live
Is a mystery. The stories about 54 an
hour being paid for labor are false. One
dollar an hour is the limit and men are
clambering over each other to get that.
Nome is rich. I don't think there is any
question about that, but no one has done
any prospecting. a.Â« every man is defend
ing his claim with a shotgun."
The St. Paul brought down $1,300,000 in
treasure but all of this save $100,000 came
from the Klondike. The dust came down
the Yukon and was transferred at St.
Michael to the mall boat and brought to
San Francisco under guard. The output
at Nome is a great disappointment, but
the lawlessness that has prevailed has
prevented any work being done. ;, Â¦â¢'Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢..'Â¦
"I never few such a camp in all my
life," said Captain Charles Anderson yes
terday. Captain Anderson was formerly
master of the brig Percy Edwards and
went north as sailing master of the bark
Alaska. "It was a case." he continued,
"of Ishmael all over again and you could
never tell when your dearest friend was
going to ptrike you. There were five
shooting scrapes inside of five days and I
guess about five deaths resulted. Who the
gun fighters were I can't tell, and I doubt
whether the records of Nome City would
either. 'Â¦..Â¦Â¦ = *v'-;;Â¦-;.;â¢ .'- :;
"There was an exodus to Norton Sound
going on when I left. There is plenty of
wood and water there and some splendid
quartz prospects. The next steamer from
Nome will be crowded with passengers
and the rush coming homeward will be as
great as those that made up the stampede
for the frozen north. â¢
"While I v.-as in Anvil City I had to pay
Jl a nlRht for the privilege of spreading
my blanket under a table in a lodging
house. Don't you talk to me about Nome
and Its millions. Potatoes and salt in San
Frnncisco are good enough for meâ that
is. as compared with the new El Dorado."
The Santa Ana was still in quarantine
on account of smallpox when the St. Paul
failed.
Ame.ng the passengers in the mail boat
was Arthur McGowan. who was formerly
a cook in a well known restaurant in
town. Arthur smiles when asked how he
"panned" out in the Arctic and says, "1
have made enoueh to enable me to live
the rest of my life without cooking other
people's meals."
The Longford partv that came down
from Rampart City is accredited with
$30,000 in dust, but as it came from the
Yukon the finding of it is part of an old
story. *
The St. Paul will be only two days In
port and will then return to Nome with
supplies.
A Lady's Opinion of Nome.
Mrs. S. Moore and Miss Nina Moore,
who arrive^ from Cape Nome on the St.
Paul ond are stopping at the Grand, tell
of a Krtm feature of life in the miners'
city. The town is so overcrowded and
deaths so frequent that behind .a small
hill back of It two men dig graves con
ntantly. They are paid $12 per grave, and
fo great Is the demand for their labors
that they always have dozens of j?raves
ready In advance, and when the. tenants
comeâ and they do not have to wait long
âtheir final resting place Is all ready.
These ladles declare emphatically that
Kome is no place for women. All of them
