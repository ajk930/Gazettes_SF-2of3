SWIMS A STREAM WITH WOUNDED COMRADE UNDER
A HEAVY FIRE IN THE ENGAGEMENT AT TIENTSIN
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. . Copyright, 1900, by the Herald Publishing Company.
T\ RESIDENT McKINLEY, Minister Wu and Washington officials generally stand alone in their
|J belief that the cipher dispatch signed "Conger," which was received by Minister Wu yester
j[ day and conveyed by him to the State Department, can be relied upon as describing the
situation of foreigners in Peking on July 18. In official circles in London, Paris and other
European capitals complete skepticism prevails. No doubt is expressed that -the cipher^dis
patch is genuine, but the conclusion is drawn, chiefly from the intrinsic evidence in ther dis
patch itself, that it was written about the same date as the messages from Sir Robert Hart,
which left the Chinese capital at the end of June. . %
In the belief that the foreign envoys are' still alive, but in grave danger, the United
States Government is determined to do everything possible to hasten the advance of the inter
national force to relieve Peking. Suggestions to this end were invited by the various govern
ments.
Dispatches from St. Petersburg give details of fighting in the Amur district. A Chinese
force cf 70C0 men was taken by surprise and 2000 killed. The attack on Russians a few
days ago was, it appears, made by the Chinese commander on an order issued in the name
of the Emperor, which was forged by Prince Tuan.
Mr. Bryan has broken his silence on Chinese affairs. He holds the European powers
responsible for the feeling of hostility toward foreigners in China, an imputation which proba
bly will be resented.
Fresh details of the losses suffered by our troops and marines at Tientsin are given in
a dispatch from one of The Call's correspondents. Colonel Liscum died a soldier's death, his
last words being: "Keep up the firing."
THE CALL'S SUMMARY OF THE CHINESE NEWS.
IN EARLY MAY AT PEKING,
AN AFTERNOON TEA AT THE BRITISH LEGATION.
From the Sketch.
LONDON, July 20. â Dispatches from Yokohama announce that another division of Japanese troops is embarking for
China, accompanied by a siege train for the reduction of Peking. . Â« '
The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail asserts that Emperor Kwang Su telegraphed to the Mikado an expres
sion of regret for the murder of the Japanese Chancellor of Legation, Sugiyima Akira, and points out that the community of inter
ests between China and Japan in the East against the ambitions of the western powers should lead the Japanese Emperor to make
common cause with China, and to assist in the restoration of peace. The Mikado, according to this correspondent, replied that
the action of the insurgents was in complete violation of international law, and that the murder of Baron von Ketteler was a griev
ous offense. The Mikado added that the Chinese Government should suppress the disorders and rescue the Ministers, thus dis
arming the hostility of Europe. His Majesty's dispatch concluded thus:
"Japan is cordially friendly and is only sending troops to rescue foreigners in Peking and to restore order. She has no
ulterior objects hostile to China, and, if proper measures are taken, she is prepared to use her influence to conserve the interests of
the Celestial empire."
The Shanghai correspondent of the Times says he learns on good authority that Li Hung Chang has undertaken to pro
ceed north in order to negotiate on three conditions: First, that a conciliatory attitude be adopted forthwith. Second, that the
Boxers be energetically suppressed. Third, that he himself is not to be held responsible, even if he fails to obtain satisfactory
. "I*have been informed by a native official that the Viceroy of Nanking's Yamen believes that a majority of the foreigners in
Peking escaped destruction on July 9, and that although a portion of General Nieh's troops joined the Boxers at Tientsin, a large
number followed General Nieh to Peking, where they have been successful in assisting Prince Ching and Yung Lu to protect the
CHINESE EMPEROR APPEALS TO JAPAN TO AID IN
CHECKING THE AMBITIONS OF EUROPEAN NATIONS
Sir Halliday Macartney, counselor and English secretary to the Chinese legation in London, who was interviewed yester
day, admitted that the legation was in receipt of news which it was not able to disclose. He added:
"You may take it that on July 18, the date of the Conger message, all the legations and Europeans in Peking were safe.
I cannot say why the other Ministers are not able to communicate with their governments, but there is no reason why they should
not use the same channel as Mr.Conger has employed."
The Spectator says: "It matters nothing whether the Empress Dowager or Prince Tuan is the reigning monarch. Both
are devoted to the extirpation of foreigners, and not one of the Viceroys will dare oppose the anti-foreign policy. The plot has
covered the whole empire. The men who have dared to order a Russian city upon Russian ground to be stormed will dare any
thing. Within a month the Viceroys of the coast towns will have thrown off the mask, and the only safe place for the Europeans
will be on shipboard, Eurqpe has a terrible task, in which hurry is out of place. Who would have dreamed six months ago that
for ten;.tli6usand7regulars to take Tientsin wouldbe a difficult audgiorious task?"
The Daily Telegraph, in an editorial congratulating the Washing-ton Government upon its energy, says: "Unless the
powers are capable of responding immediately to Mr. Hay's appeal by ordering their united forces to face and risk all for an imme
diate advance, the days not only of old chivalry but of modern humanity are dead together."
AONDON, July 21,.^ a. m. â The Conger dispatch fails to carry conviction to either the British press or public. Its genuine
g'jlLg- ness is not disputed, for, as it is pointed out here, the Chinese must possess quite a sheaf of such messages, which the Minis
isters fruitlessly endeavored to get transmitted, from which they could easily select a non-committal dispatch to serve the
required purpose. It is supposed that Mr. Conger omitted to destroy the cipher code and that this is now in possession of the Chi
nese, in which event the concoction of the dispatch would not be difficult. It is argued that the dispatch, if it were a genuine reply
to the inquiry of the Â¦American Government, would go more into details. A slight ray of hope is admitted in the fact that both
Mr. and Mrs. Conger are known to have been on very friendly terms with the Empress Doweger, but the universal opinion here is
that if the dispatch is genuine the date of its alleged filing is falsified.
The bare possibility that the news of the massacre was premature, however, has had its effect, and the Government has
issued a semi-official disclaimer of responsibility for the proposed memorial service in St. Paul's Cathedral, while the newspapers
are calling for the postponement of the service until all doubts are set at rest. ,
London Officials See in the Conger Message Only
Another Evidence of the Duplicity of the Chinese
Authorities and Resolve Not to Be Misled.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 20â A thrill of joy was felt in Washington to-day when the State Department made public a cipher message from Minister Conger announcing that foreigners in Pe
king were still alive but in danger of massacre by the Chinese mob. For a time the knowledge that the legationers were living was regarded as cause for heartfelt thanksgiving, though their peril was such that all might be lost
before aid could reach them. This rejoicing may prove to be premature. There is a growing suspicion that the message from Minister Conger was sent on the same date as that from the Japanese Ministerâ June 29â and that
it has been held up by the Chinese Director of Posts until the last possible moment. When the American '-Government insisted, through Chinese Minister Wu, that it be allowed to get a dispatch through to Peking, this mes
sage of Conger was released as the reply to the American cablegram. The fact that it bears no date tends to confirm this suspicion. It is altogether likely that the Conger message was v.*ent a week before the date of the
reported massacre in Peking, and that in the interim it has been in the possession of Chinese officials. If this view be correct, it indicates that Sheng, the Chinese Director of Telegraphs, is in league with the Boxers, and that all of
the so-called official messages reporting the safety of the legations have been falsehoods concocted to deceive the powers and delay the advance on Peking until the Chinese shall have mobilized their army and been prepared for attack.

Infantry and 430 marines. The army casualties were 18 killed, yy wounded and 2 missing. The marine casualties were 4 killed
and 23 wounded. Major Regan was wounded in the leg; Captain Bookmiller in the leg. Captain Conly in the arm and Lieutenant
Lang in the foot. Lieutenant Conrad carried Lieutenant Butler under a fierce flanking fire and was shot in the leg and arm. He

The Ninth Regiment arid other Americans, with the Japanese, advanced against a flanking fire, but were forced to- lie in
the mud all day, unable to help their wounded and compelled to drink canal water. They could not drive the foe or charge, or
do anything except fire a few rounds.
The American hospitals at Tientsin are crowded, and surgeons are. needed. . Colonel Liscum's body was escorted to its
burial place by two batteries of the Ninth. :^1~# .

BROTHER OF CONGER
BELIEVES HIM SAFE
WASHINGTON, Jult 2O.-The Chi
nese Minister. Wu Ting Fang,
was to-day the center of official
and personal congratulation over
the service he has performed for the
American Government and" the American
people In opening up communication be
tween United States Minister Conger and
Washington and in sweeping aside a mass
of horrible reports as to the wholesale
massacre of our officials and others. The
Chinese legation was In a state of Jubila
tion to-day. Minister Wu breakfasts
early in the day after the Chinese custom,
and this morning he breakfasted even
earlier than usual. Just before hn sat
down a telegraph messenger boy bicycled
up to the legation office and passed in a
dispatch. This is hot unusual, so the
message was taken in hand by a secre
tary, white the Minister proceeded with
his breakfast. The message proved to be
quite lonp. and a considerable part of it
was in an unintelligible cipher code. But
it was not until the eye fell on the name
"Conger" written in English that the full
purport of the message became ( evident.
Then there was a stir throughout the es
tablishment. The Minister was entirely
in the dark as to the meaning of the
strange groups of Arabic figures, but it
swept over him that this was a reply di
rect from Minister* Conger to Secretary
Hay's cipher cablegram of July 11.
Mr. Wu went upstairs to his private of
fice, where he was joined by his secre
tary. Mr. Chang. Word .was sent for the
Minister's automobile to take him to the
State Department. A few~ minutes later
he appeared with Mr. Chang oh the stone
balcony of the legation. In his hand he
carried a document, carefully wrapped up
in a piece of white linen. Hi3 face was
wreathed in smiles. He stepped into the
vehicle, and his American attendant turn
ed the lever and they sped down Connecti
cut avenue toward the State Department.
It was 9:45 o'clock when Mr. Wu handed
the document to Secretary Hay, and then
after brief congratulations over what
the message was believed to contain, he
retired in order that the translation of
the cipher might begin.
Minister Wu's personal feelings over
the receipt of the message are those of
intense relief following a long period of
extreme depression. He had little to say
over the message, as it speaks for Itself,
and his views could add nothing to it.
Above all he is rejoiced that the report
as to the massacre of Minister Conger
and all other foreigners is dissipated, and
this he regards as the supreme fact, not
withstanding the grave statement in the
message that the bombardment is going
on and that massacre Is Imminent. The
frankness with which this statement is
made is taken as evidence of the genuine
ness of the dispatch.
Moreover,' Minister "W'u is personally ac
quainted with the Taotai of Shanghai,
who forwarded J the State Department's
message for him, and got back the an
swer. The Minister regards him as one
of the most high-minded men In China.

YOKOHAMA (Thursday), July 19.â The
United States battleship Oregon has ar
rived at Kure, where she will undergo
temporary repairs.
There is stitl much uncertainty as to
what Is happening along the Russian
frontier of China, and as to its possible
effect upon the operations for the relief
of Peking. It would obviously be embar
rassing to the other powers to continue
to co-operate with Russia in the Peking
expedition if that power should declare
war on China, but the disposition of the
Washington Government is **not to let
anything stand in the way of the rescue
of "Americans in Peking, and if Russia
should decla* war the other powers
might continue the advance on the Chi
nese capital and then withdraw and con
fine their operations to the protection of
citizens in treaty ports.
Embassador Tower, who arrived here
to-day from St. Petersburg, is not dis
posed to credit the report that Russia has
declared war, or will do so. He thinks it
is probable that the Russian Government
haÂ«! declared a state of siege in the region
along the frontier where troubles have
occurred, which is equivalent to a declar
ation of martial law for the purpose of
restoring order.
Little attention has been given here to
day to the proposition for an interna
tional congress to settle the future of
China. The immediate necessity for relief
of Peking is so pressing that the authori
ties believe the question of final settle
ment of the Chinese problem can rest for
the present. In the meantime the Instruc

China as special commissioner, will be
prepared and will be given to him as
soon as he returns from New Eneland.

WASHINGTON. July 2O.-As was antici
pated, the Japanese Government has
given its cheerful assent to the application
of the United States Government for per
mission to land armed troops and military
supplies at Nagasaki in transit to Taku,
China.
-This privilege was desired In order that
the Pacific transports plying between San
Francisco and Manila should not be di
verted from their regular routes, but that
the troops and stock carried by them
and intended for service in China might
be transferred at Nagasaki to other ves
sels of the transport service and taken
direct to Taku. The Japanese authori
ties not only have agreed to the proposed
use of Nagasaki, but they also have as
sured the United States Government that

LONDON* July 20.â During the course of
an interview > Sir Charles Dilke, the form

statesman who is universally regarded as

on foreign affairs, said that he regarded
the latest news 'from China as extremely
grave.. ->Â¦Â¦: Â¦ . Â¦Â¦
."Up to the invasion of Russian territory
by the Chinese troops, there was nothing
to lead us.to^mippose that there was a
directing and controlling government at
Peking. : â¢Â¦Â¦ .
"The invasion of the Russian Amur
province is a visible sign that there is a
responsible government still in power
"If China were as we have believed
until now, in the throes of civil war
neither of the contending parties would
have time or opportunity to carry its
hostile operations into a foreign country
"The Chinese attack upon Russia has
all the appearance of being an act of the
imperial Government at Peking and the
only interpretation to be placed upon this
move is that the responsible Chinese Gov.
ernment at Peking has proclaimed war
upon Russia and upon the powers
"In this connection I must confess that
I am much impressed by the fact that LI
Hung Chang should have felt it incum
bent upon him to comply with the sum

Brigadier General Heywood. command
ant of the Marine Corps, and Colonel
Denny had a conference with Secretary
Long this afternoon, at which it was de
termined to give Colonel Meade 4000 men.
In order to do this the corps, which is
now about 850 short of its authorized
strength, will be recruited up to the limit
of 6000 men, and all shore stations, except
those in the Philippine Islands, will be
stripped of every man who can be spared.
The marine guards on ships in commis
sion will also be reduced as much as pos
sible. Not taking Into account the marine
guard which went to Peking, and which
may have been wiped out of existence,
there are now in China or on the way 750
marines. Major Dickine will sail from
San Francisco, July 28, with 600 more. An
other battalion of the same size will be
ready In about two weeks and others will

BIG FORCE OF MARINES
TO MARCH ON PEKING
"Every one deplores the destruction of
life in China, and is horrified at the bar
barities practiced. * 'Every one knows that
it Is the duty of our Government to pro
tect the lives and property of American
citizens residing in China, and I have no
doubt that the administration will do so.
I also take it for granted -that all Amer
ican citizens will withdraw from Chini
temporarily or take refuge in some sea
port, where they can be protected by
American ships until the excitement is
over. If the Chinese Government has
tried in good faith to protect our citizens
suitable punishment tor the guilty and
reparation and indemnity for those who
have suffered can doubtless be secured.
If. upon investigation, it is found that the
Chinese Government has not acted m
good faith Congress has power to deal
with the matter. For several years Eu
ropean nations have been threatening to
dismember China and it is not strant;o
that their ambitious designs should arouso
a feeling of hostility toward foreigners.
That feeling, however, ought not to be
directed against American citizens, and
will not If ou"r nation makes it known that
it has no desire to grab land or to trespass
upon the rights of China. A firm adher
ence to the American policy of justice and
fair dealing will not only set an exampis
to other nations, but will give our citizens
residing in China the best promise of se
curity. It will be better for our mer
chants to have it known that they seek
trade only when trad* is mutually ad
vantageous, and it will be better for our
missionaries to have it known that thsy
are preaching the gospel of love and are
not the forerunners of fleets and armies."

Notice Sent to General Mac-

Will Be Called Upon for
More Troops for China.
The War Department had figured upon
hearing from General Chaffee at Naga
saki to-day, but this evening had received
no message from him. The run tq_ Taku
from Nagasaki occupies three days, and
without accident he should reach the
mouth of the Feiho on Monday or Tues
day. He left San Francisco on the trans
port Grant on July 3 with 1119 officers and
men of the Sixth Cavalry. The Fourteenth
Infantry, including twenty-one officers
and 847 men, with a detachment of the
Ninth Infantry and one officer and thirty
one men, one ordnance sergeant, one chap
lain and sixteen hospital corps men, left
Manila oh July 15 on the transport Indi
ana. The transport Flintshire left on the
same date with seven officers and 271 men
of Reilly's battery of the Fifth Artillery,
two surgeons and five hospital corps men.
The distance from Manila to Taku should
be easily covyed in a week. Thus on
Monday 2300 men should be added
to the force already in the' field, which
consists of the Ninth Infantry, of 1310 of
ficers and men, and the marine detach
ment of 500 members.
The Sixth Cavalry, with General Chaf
fee, the Fourteenth Infantry and Reilly's
battery of the Fifth Artillery, should be
at Taku by Monday.
CA.LL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON, July 20.â It was said at the
War Department to-day on good
authority that plans were being con
sidered for the sending of additional
troops from the Philippines to China, and
that a message forewarning General Mac-
Arthur of a possible second call upon him
for reinforcements had been forwarded to
day. Secretary Root refused to confirm
this statement.
As closely as can be estimated by the
authorities here, there are now at Taku
and Tientsin In the allied army 20,000 to
25,003 soldiers. Of this number Japan has
the largest portionâ 22,000 men. Mr.
Nabeshima. the charge d'affaires of the
Japanese Embassy, said this afternoon
that while this number was probably on
Chinese soil, he could not be positive,
since his last Information from home wa-*
that this number would be sent at once.
No additional naval vessels will be sent
to the Chinese coast. Secretary Long con
siders those already there with the co
operation of the ships of the other nations?
arc sufficient to keep the seaports from
turbulence and that under the conditions
more vessels would be useless.
For some reason no additional flag of
ficer will be appointed to the Asiatic sta
tion. Rear Admirals Remey and Kempff
having the entire confidence of the depart
ment.
While the administration will, to a cer
tain extent rely upon the Tsung-U
Yamen to keep foreigners In safety and
restore order, nothing -will be overlooked
that in any way can hasten the departure
of the Peking relief column from Tien
tsin. From statements made this even
ing by Secretary Root it is Inferred that
although much ha3 been left to General
Chaffee's good judgment, he has been in
structed to advance toward the Chinese
capital immediately.
A very encouraging feature la the con
sent of the Japanese government to the
use of Nagasaki as a base of supplies an-1
for the landing of troops. To facilitate
the transfer of soldier3 and stores thence
to Taku the quartermaster general has
assigned three large transports to duty
between those ports ajid Japan promise3
every form of assistance.

AFTER LI HUNG CHANG'S DEPARTURE
LONDON, July 20.â To add to the gloom occasioned by the extremely serious impor
tant, news showing the daily developing strength of the anti-foreign movement in the south of
China, comes this morning from Shanghai a report that sixty missionaries and a hundred native
converts have been murdered atTai Yuan, a fortified and populous city in the province of Shen
si, on the Fuen Ho, an affluent of the Hoang Ho, twenty-five miles southwest of Peking.
The report is not yet corroborated, but itjends to confirm -the belief that the hope that the
central and southern Viceroys would hold aloof from the Boxer movement was unfounded. -'U

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF EVENTS
LEADING TO THE PRESENT CRISIS IN CHINA
Then Secretary Hay betook himself to
the War Department to convey the news
in person to Secretary Root and to Sec
retary Long, who were together at the
time.
After a short consultation in Secretary
Root's office Secretary Long, upon emerg
ing into the corridor, was showered with
congratulations by a large throng of de
partment employes and newspaper men
who had congregated there. As the one
member of the Cabinet who has con
sistently maintained during the dark
days in which others had given up all
hope the safety of the I or* igners in
Peking, the news that our Minister wa3
alive a few days ago was much in the
nature of a personal triumph for him.
His face beamed with pleasure and he ex
pressed his gratification and rejoicing at
the confirmation of his theory.
Optimism of Long.
"We are all very happy over the good
tidings," said he. "I have hardly had time
to think of the exact effect of the news
upon the situation, but It removes one of
the great elements of doubt and leaves
WASHINGTON*. July 20.â After hope
had almost been abandoned of
hearing from the legations In Pe
king, two cablegrams, bearing
tidings of the unfortunates beset in the j
British legation, were received this morn
ing. First came a short, sharp word from .
Consul General Goodnow, at Shanghai, an I
officer of the State Department who will j
not be soon forgotten because of the im- j
mense energy and zeal he has exhibited
in securing information to meet the de
mand of the department in the* exciting
days of the past six weeks. He gave
notice that Minister Conger had at last
been heard from directly and that his
words were on the \tay to the State De
partment.
Scarcely had the cheering news reached
Secretary Hay before Minister ffu came
tearing down the asphalt streets from his
legation in his automobile bearing in his
hands the precious message from Mr. Con
ger. The Minister was perspiring and
almost speechless with pleasurable ex
citement and even the swift new elevator
in the State Department scarcely could
meet his demand for haste in reaching
Secretary Hay.
The Secretary already had prepared
himself for the Minister's appearance, but.
nevertheless, not knowing the nature of
Mr. Conger's communication, he sat in
suppressed anxiety to receive the message.
Mr. \Vu himself was Ignorant of what he
had in his hand, because the message was
in the State Department cipher, an ap
parently meaningless mass of figures and
periods.
Translation of Cipher.
Secretary Hay at once called for Assis
tant Secretary Adee. and the two dis
tinguished officials themselves set to work
translating the cipher into Engiish. This
occupied nearly half an hour. The first
movement of Secretary Hay upon de
ciphering was to make a copy and dis
patch this by messenger In haste to the
White House, with a request to the tele
graphers there to forward It at the earliest
moment to President McKlnley for his
information.
Then Secretary Hay, remembering the
intense public anxiety to have tidings of
the Americans in Peking, caused his pri
vate secretary to prepare copies of the
message he had received, thoughtfully ac
companying them with an explanatory
statement, and these copies were given to
the* newspaper men, who by this time,
scenting the fact that news of the great
est importance had come, began crowding
the broad corridor before the Secretary's
office.

MINISTER WU THE BEARER OP
CONGER'S APPEALING MESSAGE
The British and French Commissioners demanded that the crime be
purged by some signal punishment; but the Chinese authorities stuck to
their policy of prevarication, evasion and delay, until the patience of the
Europeans was exhausted and the order was given to burn the splendid
summer palace of the Emperors.
This was done, and brought the Chinese to quick terms. Lord Loch suffered
for a long time from the effects of his tortureâ which is more fully described
in a narrative which he wrote of the expedition.
The experience of Lord Loch at tho hands of the Chinese authorities at
the time of the advance of- the British and French on Peking affords a very
useful example at the present time of the treachery, duplicity and cruelty
to which the celestials are naturally given, and how little faith Is to be put
on their most solemn oaths and promises.
On the approach of the allied armies, September 21, 1S60. "to Tungchow.
twelve miles east of Peking. Mr. (now Lord) Loch, Sir Harry Parkes. with
several other English and French gentlemen and officers, and an escort of
troopers, were seized and made prisoners by Chinese when under a flag of
truce, and dragged before Sankolinsln. their general commanding. They
were forced to press their heads to the ground at his feet, and undergo other
Insults and personal mistreatment in his presence, and were then cruelly
bound and hurried on! to Peking, where they were subjected to such loath
some indignities and cruel personal torture that words fall to properly'de
scribe. Their hands were bound behind their backs as tightly as four men
could draw the cords, and then these were kept wet with water to increase
the strain. In this fix they were thrust Into cages and carried through the
streets, day after day. amid the jeers of the rabble, who were allowed to
throw mud and filth on them at will. At night they were thrust into filthy
dungeons, and food of the most loathsome kind forced into their mouths.
A number of the party died fn a few days from the torture, their handa rot
ting off under the cords while still bound behind them. Lieutenant Ander
son became delirious and died after nine days, Mr. d<Â» Norman some days
later. Of the fate of the others, including Captain Brabazon and a French
officer, no accurate information was ever obtained. Of the whole party of
twenty-four. Sir Harry Parkes, Mr. Loch, one Sikh trooper, one French officer
and four soldiers were returned. October "8. after the Emperor had fled to
Jehol and the allies had captured the summer palace and were threatening
to raze Peking Itself to the ground, unless the prisoners were restored. All
the time the Chinese officials protested that no harm had befallen any of
them and that they were all well.
THE LATE LORD LOCH, ONCE A
VICTIM OF CHINESE TREACHERY
The fact that the cablegram from Min
ister Conger was given scant credence in
London official circles had no dampening
effect on the optimism of the State De
partment officials. It was pointed out by
one of the officials s interested that the
weight of International evidence in the
dispatch was in favor of its genuineness.
Besides there were the several strongly
corroborative dispatches from Conaul
Goodnow and Consul Fowler. The fact
that Minister Conger mentioned the bom
bardment of the British legation was con
sidered good- evidence that the dispatch
was written subsequent to the 6th, as
the best information here is that the bom
bardment of the legations did not begin
prior to that date. It was said at the
State Department that it was not thought
expedient to give out either the text or
a paraphrase of the message sent by the
State Department July 11 to Minister Con
ger.
'Throughout the day the Conger message
remained the absorbing topic of discus
sion. Secretary Hay was congratulated
on the success of the steps he had adopted
to open up communication between Peking
and Washington, for, while the chancel
lories of the world stood hesitating and
inactive, he had adopted a course which
had brought a message from our Minis
ter. The Chinese Minister, Mr. Wu.
shared also in the universal approbation
of what had been done. He seconded Mr.
Hay's effort from the outset, and It is
due to the official machinery set In mo
tion by him that the communications were
gotten thiough. It is appreciated by the
officials, both American and Chinese, that
there will be suspicion in some quarters.
Against this it is declared that a message
authenticated by the American code and
backed by the integrity of the officials
through whom it has passed must be ac
cepted as authentic until something better
than mere suspicion Is brought forth.
Later in the day several messages were
received from United States Consul Fow
ler at Chefu, all strongly confirmatory of
tho news that the foreigners were alive.
Unaffected by London's Pessimism.
It is assumed to Indicate that Tuan Shih
Kai has thrown the weight of his Influ
ence on the side of the government. Yuan
is considered one of the ablest, if not the
ablest, general in China. He has,
according to a statement made by
Lord Charles Beresford to a promi
nent State Department official when
he was here last fall, the best
drilled and equipped army in China
under his command. Some doubt was en
tertained as to which side he would ally
himself with in the present insurrection,
and the fact that he appears to be on tho
side of the government is accepted as evi
dence that his best Judgment is that
Prince Tuan's rebellion is destined to fall.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Like a
flash of sunlight out of the dark
sky came the intelligence at an
early hour to-day that United
States Minister Conger had sent
a cipher cablegram from Peking to the
State Department at Washington making
known that two days ago he was alive
and that the foreigners were fighting for
their safety. The Chinese Minister, Wu
Ting Fang, received the message. Within
an -hour the welcome intelligence that Mr.
Conger had been heard from, after weeks
of silence and evil report, was flashed
through the country, and indeed, through
out the world, dispelling the gloom which
had prevailed everywhere and bringing to
officials and to the public generally a
sense of profound relief. The dispatch is
supposed to be in reply to Secretary Hay'-J
cable of inquiry to Minister â¢ Conger -on
July 11, and as both messages were in the
American cipher code they were regarded
by the officials as above the suspicion of
having been tampered with In the course
of transmission through Chinese channels.
Mr. Wu promptly communicated the dis
patch to the State Department, where the
translation was made from the cipher
figures and soon all Washington was aatlr
with the intelligence.
Telegraphed to the President.
It was telegraphed by Secretary Hay to
the President, who responded with a
wholesome expression of gratification and
word of it was sent to the various Cabinet
officers. They gathered in Secretary Hay's
office and an impromptu Cabinet con
ference was held in the diplomatic cham
ber, mainly for the purpose of exchang
ing congratulations and of taking a sur
vey of the situation to see if it had been
materially changed by this important de
velopment. First of all, from the stand
point of the administration officials, the
most welcome feature of the message was
its assurances .that the American .Min
ister himself was alive two days ago. But
with this cheering news came the ominous
statement of Minister Conger that the
besieged foreigners were in the British
legation under continuous shot and shell
from Chinese troops, and that only quick
relief could avert a general massacre.
After the first flush of thankfulness this
graver feature of the message began to
Impress itself upon the Cabinet officials
most deeply. As one of them remarked:
"There are the poor creatures, penned
up under fire of shot and shell, and ap
pealing to us for help."
The consultation brought about no pro
nounced change of policy, for it was felt
that already every energy had been bent
toward meeting the situation and that
there was absolutely nothing more that
could be done. After all, the Cabinet of-
In this connection the message from
Consul Fowler that General Yuan Shih
Kai, Governor of Shantung province, re
ported that the Chinese authorities were
doing all in their power to cut down the
insurrection is exceedingly welcome Intel
ligence. It not only confirms the theory
of the State Department that the position
of the Chinese Government is correct, but
Fowler's Confirmatory IMspa'tches.
Secretary Hay says he attached no sig
nificance to the use of the words "Chinese
troops" in the message. They did not.
In his opinion, mean that the Chinese
Government troops were besieging the
foreigners. He seemed to entertain little
doubt that the Chinese Government itself
was doing all in its power to suppress the
Boxer insurrection.
"Of course," said Secretary Hay, smil
ing, "I am not omniscient and may be
fooled, but I cannot see how the authen
ticity of Minister Conger's cable can be
questioned."
Secretary Root sent a similar notifica
tion to Colonel Coolidge, the senior officer
ashore at Tientsin. This action was the
result of the conference of Secretaries
Hay, Long and Root. It was realized
that the land and naval forces of the
United States now in China could not
single handed push on to Peking, and the
other powers accordingly were appealed
to, on the basis of Minister Conger's
message, to co-operate for relief. Secre
tary Hay explained his reasons for plac
ing reliance in the authenticity of Min
ister Conger's dispatch, saying that It
-Â¦was a complete reply in code to the code
message sent to him and that its au
thenticity was vouched for by the Tsung
Li Yamen. â¢
This message. Secretary Long explained,
meant for Admiral Remey to himself
"use" and "urge" upon the commanding
officers of the other powers the use of
every endeavor for the j relief of Peking.
The Government accepted the message
as authentic, and Secretary Hay trans
mitted it to all our Embassadors and Min
isters abroad, with instructions to lay it
before the respective governments to
which they are accredited and to urge
upon them the necessity of co-operation
for the immediate relief of the foreigners
at Peking. A message also was sent by
Secretary Long to Admiral Remey con
veying the intelligence of the desperate
situation in Peking and instructing him
to use and urge every possible endeavor
for relief.
Europe Urged to Act.
flcials felt, and so stated, the message
was an evidence of friendliness 1 and good 1
faith of the pro-foreign element of the
Chinese, and wisdom dictated a course
which would continue to utilize this
friendship.
Rejoicing Washington Over the Peking
Cablegram Dammed by the Fear That
the Legations Might Not Be Able to
Hold Out U ntil the Relief Force
Reaches Them.
NO matter how painfully death may
have come to Mary Condit Smith,
the pretty Washington girl who. it
is now almost certain, was mur
dered by Boxers, it was sweet to
the living death she was suffering, says
the New York World. The Chinese may
have visited .ireadful tortures upon her,
yet death to her in any form was a relief,
for Mary Condit Smith was a martyr to
Washington scandalmongers and was lit
<ra!iy driven to her death by malicious
frnssip.
y...ry Condit Smith died in trying to live
down and forget that she had been ac
cused ot theft. No more Innocent, no
purer pirl ever lived than she, yet she was
rot proof against scandal and gossip, and.
horror-stricken, ashamed, cowed, she
sought to forget by traveling from one
*nd of the earth to the other.
It wes in Pittsburg that the seed of
scur.dal that led to Miss Condit Smith's
murder was planted. In Washington she
was known as "Polly" Smith. There she
was loved. Women cared for her because
ehe was sincere and sensible; men were
fond of her because she was pretty and
always agreeable. She was a laughing,
light-hearted girl, welcomed everywhere.
From every fide came Invitations for
"Polly" Smith. She was sought at the
"White House, at official entertainments, at
private houses. In fact, it may be said
that no girl in Washington society had
more invitations or was more popular than
Miss "Polly."
That Fated House Party.
When the invitation came for her to at
tend a house party given by her wealthy
friends the Mocrheads at 92S Ridge ave
nue. Allegheny City, last fall she accepted.
"Washington was gay enough at the time,
but particular friends of hers were giving
the house party, and she hated to disap
point them.
It was a gay house party they had in
Pittsburg. ';Po!ly" Smith was the gayest
cf all, and when the time came for every
body to go home she was the best liked of
*Â»;; the guests. .No one denied that she
had been the life of the party, and that
Â¦without her things would have fallen flat.
It was after the house party had broken
up that the scandal took root. The hostess
had missed jewelry to the value of more
than JL\Â»OO. Her guests were all persons of
the highest standing ar.d of unimpeach
able character. She called in detectives
ar.d told them their names.
She at that time suspected no one of
havir.g taken her jewels who was num
bered among her guests. But the police
are not rerpecters of family pride and
family names, so the detectives began to
pearch for the jewels among the guests at
the house party.
The Superintendent of Pittsburg De
tective?. John Glenn, undertook the case,
as the stolen jewels had been a wedding
present to his bride from Mr. Moortw-ad.
and aside from their intrinsic vaiue, \1~*Â«),
Â¦were more precious to Mrs. Moorhead
than any money. The eight servants in
the- farr.ilv were, after most careful inves
tigation, relieved of suspicion. Many
other dete-ctlves -were employed, and it
was through a New York jeweler to whom
pome unset fliamonds were sent for reset
ting, that the Jim clew to the lost perns
was r**cciv<?d. Whoever stole the Moor
head diamonds ha/1 pried the Jewels out
of their setting and then endeavored to
have them set in now fashion so that they
could never be recognized. Money, then,
uaj not the motive of the robbery.
Tbia ravi' to the Washington detectives
ths first dew to the Moorheads' guests.
Mr. r.r.d Mr*. MoDrhe.id could not be made
to believe in the guilt of any of them, but
a Washington dett-etive. following descrip
tions and circ-jmsia:itial evidence, finally
convinced the- Moor heads that the thief
actually was Mirs Condit Smith, the ac
complishpd and lovely girl whose talent
.inci popularity made her welcome every
where and who had repeatedly enjoyed the
honor of re-ceivins f!Â«3p by Fide with Mrs.
M'KinNn- m the White House. Of course,
the Lioorhcads refused to make the Wash
ington detective's story public. but.
Â«.-<}uÂ«lly. of course, it leaked out In that
exclusive Bet in which the young girl
rnow-d.
The Ptory we-r.t frem i *nouth to mouth,
from house to house. Pretty "Polly"
Smith was suspecte-d. In fact it is said
trat Bonn malicious perron even went so
far as to .iccuse t*e girl.
Crushed by the Scandal.
Thrn thÂ»Â»rÂ«? came a charge over '"Polly"
Smith. She was no longer the Ifght
1: carted girl. She had hoard the
scandal. 8he wss helpless. She â¢was in
nocent, but :he blow aimed" at her had
crushed ber. Invitations came in fewer
numbers and those that did come were
not accepted. The girl got paler and
paler. She waÂ» seldom seen outside her
own home. Her cheeks became sunken;
her so bright ar.d laughing for
merly, were reÂ«d from constant weopinjr:
s'ie never smilenl ar.d her sensitive nature
mado her imagine that the whole worid
suspected Iv?r of a crime of which she
was innocent.
Miss Smith's brother-in-law is Gover
nor General Wood of Cuba. It waa
thcusiu that a change of scene and
Lefi the National Capital for Peking, There
to Forget the Cruel Charge of
Malicious Scandalmongers.
' climate Â¦would help the g\r\ forget the
cruel gossip that had so sorely wounde.l
her. So Miss Smith was sent to Cuba
to be with her sister, Mrs. Wood. Cuban
climate and tho change of scenes did not
have tho beneficial effect expected.
The pirl tried bravely to overcome the
constant fear that she was everywhere
pointed at as a thief. She tried to meet
people as she had done before, but it was
no use. She became so weakened in health
an<l spirits that the every effort was bc
yond her rtrength.
So she settled down to a life of misery,
literally eating her own heart. It was
seen by the Woods that the girl would
eventually die unless some plan could be
devised to take her mind from the great
wrong that had been done her.
Nearly a year passed before the mys
tery was partially cleared up by finding:
the settings of the diamonds In a Penn
sylvania avenue shop In Washington,
where they had been taken undoubtedly
by the real thief. Xo one knows to this
day exactly how. when or by whom the
jewels were purloined. The discovery of
them came too late. An Irreparable in
jury had been done to the young girl,
without the slightest fa-ult of her host,
hostess or the detectives.
So Wa5hington accepted the finding of
the Jewels In a disinterested sort of way.
Washington had almost forgotten the ac
cusation made against "Poliy" Smith by
this time in the freshness of other gossip
â¢on which Washington feeds, but "Polly"
Smith had not forgotten.
Could Not Forget.
She came home from Cuba immedlately
after the jewels had been found, and no
doubt could have taken her own place
In society had she been able to forget,
but she was not of the forgetting kind.
She continued unhappy,- never speaking
unless she was spoken to, growing thin
ner and less like her former self every
day. Society had all but killed her by its
love of gossip.
It was when her family had almost de
spaired of ever making her well and hap
py again that the trip to China was pro
posed. The Congers were close to the
Condit Smiths. They loved the "Polly"
Smith they had known of old. The girl
left for China with the expressed purpose
cf staying there always. In China she
could at least be among people who would
not gossip. What if they were heathens?
What if they did kill her, as they perhaos
have done? They would at least maice
her misery shortlived.
So 'â¢Polly" Smith went to China. She
was a pitiful looking little thing when
she left Washington, the only home ehe
had ever known, where she had done so
much to make happy the lives of others.
It is paid that it was Miss Smith's pur
pose to eventually be a missionary in
China. She could never return to Wash
ington. It was urged upon her that Wash
ington had already forgotten the accusa
tion made against her and was only too
ready to right the wrong. The wrong,
however, was too great to her thinking
to ever be righted and she chose to go
from her home forever.
How "Polly" Smith met death has not
been made known' as yet, but, no mat
tor how she died, death was sweet to
her. There may be those In Washington
to-day who suffer a pang for the girl
whom they sent to her death. Xone can
deny that the calumny they helped to
give breath and life to made her a martyr.

HOMING PIGEON RECORDS.
The Pacific Coast record for young
birds on long distance flights was broken
on last Sunday by five birds of H. C.
Worth's loft. These birds were all hatched
between January 25 and February 20, and
were the winners in the Redding race on
July S. flying at the rate of 103G yards per
minute, arriving 55 minutes ahead of the
second prize winners.
After a rest of four days these young
birds were Jumped 100 miles, being shipped
to Siskiyou for the purpose of testing
their speed and endurance. '.
The birds were ail liberated at 5 a. m.
by. the Wells-Fargo agent and the Pacific
Coast Homing Society. Official timers
were on hand to register the arrivals. The
birds all arrived together at 1:30 p. m..
having flown at the rate of 1015 yards per
minute, the distance being 294 miles and
567 yards cm an air line. Since 150 milea
is considered the society's limit for, first
season young birds, this record for f\\ e
months old birds will undoubtedly stand
for a long time.

The question of paramount interest in
baseball circles this week is whether those
Teutonic pacemakers of the San Francis
co team are able to keep up their speed
on the Sacramento grounds. If they do
not break they should return with two
more victories to their credit, for they
hav<> been playing the quality of ball that
wins pennants. But to defeat Sacramento
they must BU*tain their speed, for the
champions are in good form. Pitcher
Hughes proved last week that he was
Etill in good fettle and that his arm was
by no m^jins dead. Manager Harris ex
pects to use Knfell in one of the games.
Knell did not make a satisfactory show
ing last Sunday, but it should not have
been expected In view of his long retire
ment. He complained of soreness in his
muscles after pitching three innings, and
asked to be taken out of thÂ«> box. During
the week he has taken considerable exer
cise and should be in condition to-day.
Within tho past week there have been
no defections from the Oakland team, and
no more princely offers have been re
ceived from the men in Montana who
have money to burn and who have carried
their political war Into the baseball field.
Though Manager Ewlng has been some
what embarrassed he is by no means dis
couraged. He has been negotiating for
two star ball tossers who have been play-
Ing In an Eastern minor league, and if he
succeeds In landing them he will still have
a strong team. He thinks that he has a
good man In Pitcher Jones, although the
lauÂ»r through nervousness did not show
urr well in the opening game. Held, the
new fielder, is a good one and will put
pingpr Into the teamâ an element that has
be-en badly needed.
Manager Harper has been complaining
of the poor stick work of his men. and
also of the hard luck which deprived him
of Lockhead's services in several games.
He has signed Joe McGucken. the fast
outfielder of San Jose, and will probably
release Morrow, who is regarded as the
only slow man in the team. The Stocktons
have undoubtedly encountered much hard
luck, but they have managed to keep
within striking distance of the leaders.
The Stocktons and Oaklands will pro
vide tbe attraction at Recreation Park
this week. The line-up for to-day is as
follows:

Coursing Men Getting Ready
for the First Day at
San Mateo.
The Ifcglesld.-; Coursing Association i3
I working hard to make the opening day at
! San Mateo Park an auspicious one. The
management has decided to commence its
Innings on Saturday, July 2S. and as the
Union Park date closes on Sunday next
there will be no midweek stake run next
week unless other arrangements are made
by the two associations. Two stakes are
on the card, and the doubling of the en
trance fee In both events will force the
owners to nominate only their best dogs.
The slxteen-dog champion event will be
the feature, and the coursing public will
have a chance to see the high class rabbit
chasers come together. The entries so far
are Luxor, Beacon, Palo Alto, Royal
Flush. Flora McDonald, Master Claire and
Spiteful. . ,Â¦
. The open stake is limited to sixty-four
dogs, with entrance fee fixed at J5. The
drawing for both stakes will be held at
Pythian Castl? on Wednesday night. Fol
lowing the opening day a midweek stake
will be run on Wednesday, and if the en
tries warrant four events will be run each
week of the meeting. Arrangements have
been completed for the same train service
as now given to Union Park, and passen
pcrs on the electric cars will be carried to
the entrance of the grounds on the branch
line.
Union Park natrons had a chance to size
up the recently imported dog John Doe at
the Thursday midweek meet. J. McCar
thy, the owner, listened to many nice
thing? said of his hound. Coursing men
were- not backward in expressing their
satisfaction as to the dog's appearance.
John Doe in color and marks resembles
the fast Palo Alto. At the Instance of
several of his admirers the clog was put
on the scales and he tipped the beam at
fifty-four pounds.
Harlean Gladys, the winner of last
Thursday's midweek stake, is a Futurity

The Corinthian regatta In cruising rig- held last Sunday was very success
fully carried out. During the racing thÂ«re was a fair breexe. which later on
stiffened into half a gale. The suggestion that the crencs should start in
their yawls at the firing of the signal gun, row out to the yachts, make sail
and cast off from the mooring3 was made by ex-Commodore W. A. Stringer.
and proved interesting and novel. In the Mosquito class J. M. Mattoon's
Doris II, the racing machine imported last year from Hongkong, where she
won the Commodore's Cup of the Royal Hongkong Yacht Club, beat thÂ«
vawl Kittiwake. which was sailed by Georgs Wellington. The two Utt.d
fellows, had a hard struggle against the rtood tide, the trip occupying tare*
hours and a half. In the 2S-foot class the Phoenicia made sail first, then the
Cupid, ar.d last the May. At the finish J. A. Breltzman's Cnpid led. May
was second and Phoenicia did not complete the course. In the 30-foot class,
which alwavs produces the most interesting racing, and bringa out tht
largest field" Frank Stone's Presto beat Carl Westerfeld's Aeolus by 4 min
utes 52 seconds: and Misnon beat Amigo by 4 minutes 57 second3. Anon?
the 26- footers E. F. Sagar's Edna and Short Brothers' Emma made a ctoaÂ«
race but the tormer won by 2i f-ecords. The sloop Queen -i!d not tirush.
In the M-foot class Mischief ran Harpoon very close, and. though she did not
finish first, her owner received the prize, as a protest made against W. H.
Toerkes Harpoon was allowed. .The yawl Nereid received the prize la tbÂ»
special* class for yawls. Harpoon covered the course in the shortest time.
I hour 3S minutes" 43 seconds. The first boat in each class won a pewter mug.
which will be engraved with name, date. etc. To-day the Corinthians cruise
to Sierra Point in the lower bay, returning to-morrow.
On Sunday nearly the whole of the San Francisco Ceet. except the flag
ship Ramona. cruised in the Upper Bay. The schooner Chlspa. the yawl
Phillis. the cutter Folly, and the sloops Rover. Thetis, Juanlta. Siren and

Perpetual Challenge Cup will take place on Saturday. August 4. The regatta
committees of the San Francisco ar.d Corinthian club3 met on_ Wednesday,
and arranged that a preparatory gun should be fired at 12:oo p. m.. and
that 1 o'clock be the starting time, the yachts being allowed ten minutes
within which to cross the line. The course will be. acres? an imaginary
line drawn from Powell-street wharf to a stake boat distant about *X> yards

PREPARING FOR
THE BIG EVENT
Cycling Men Anticipate a
Monster Meeting During
the Celebration.
The big meet planned by the local
wheelmen for September 9 at Ingleside as
a part of the Native Sons' celebration has
attracted unbounded Interest throughout
the entire State and now gives promise of
being a monster event. Next Tuesday
evening a special meeting of the Native
Sons' vehicle and bicycle committee will
be held. at the headquarters in the Palace
Hotel, which v,ill be attended by many
of the leading wheelmen of the city. Ow
ing to the absence of Chairman Frank
Kerrigan, Vice Chairman Eannan will
preside. It Is now planned to make this
meet one of the big features of the cele
bration. On September 9 there is practi
cally no counter attraction and on tnis ac
count both wheelmen and Native Sons an
ticipate an enormous attendance at the
bicycle races, especially as there is some
po?sibllty of a free gate on that occasion.
The programme as outlined will include a
fifty-mile relay race, several short distance
sprints and four automobile races. In
the fifty-mile relay event the competing
teams will probably be an follows: The
Reno Wheelmen ol Reno, Nevada, the
champions of the coast; Capital Clty
\\ heeimen of Sacramento; Garden City
Wheelmen of San Jose; Olympics and Bay
Cltys of this city. An effort is being made
to induce a team from Los Angeles to
come north for this event. If these teams
all compete it will mean an attendance of
sixty of the best racing men in this State
and Nevada. Next week Chairman Kerri
gan will appoint a sub-committee of
wheelmen to co-operate with the Native
Sons committee in handling this big af
fair.
On Tuesday night the Cycle Path Asso
ciation will hold a meeting at the head
quarters In the Parrott building, at which

who will commence active operations im
mediately. Everything is progressing
very favorably, and as planned now the
path will, be completed well into isan Ma
teo County this fall. The route will leave
the park in the vicinity of Strawberry
Hill and continue out Nineteenth avenue
the new street the city is opening: to the
Ingleside road. By this means the path
will cross the Trocadero Gulch over the

N'ETT YORK. July 20.â The second -day
of the national regatta over the Speed
way course on the Harlem River was
productive cf some excellent oarsmanship
and the sport generally was of a higher
class than on the opening day. The
weather was fine, but a strong breeze
blew directly against the crews and at
times the water, where not sheltered, was
rough.
The first event was the Paris single*.
in which Rumohr. Ten Eyck and Titus
ptartf-d. Ten Eyck and Rumohr caught
the water together. For the first minuta
both rowed forty strokes and their shelfa
were bow and bow. After this Ten Eyck
forged ahead, as Titus was well in the
rear, and b*>gan to wear over toward
Kuinohr'js water and gave him the benefit
of his wash. Thus they rowed for a
quarter of a mile, when Ten Eyck drew
away a little mire and was directly in
front of P.umohr's boat- At this point
Rumohr spurtt-d. The shells swm*^ to
tcuch ar.d Rumohr raised his hand, claim
ing a foul. Rumohr stopped rowing, but
on seeing the referee's boat did not
slacken spe*>d. rowed on and finished two
and a half lensrths behind Ten Eyck.
The referee. Walter Stimpson of Boston,
trhen asked to explain why Ten Eyck waj
not disqualified, said:
"There may have been a foul, but I did
not see it." Had the referee decided that
Ten Eyck fouled Rumohr the race would
have fceen rowed over again, for the re
gatta committee long- ago agreed thct
none of the Paris races could be decided
on fouls.

VALLEJO, July 20.â The entry of Wal
ter K, the mysterious and unknown side
wheeler, supposedly hailing from Ala
bama and susplcioned as a ringer, was
protested by L. D. Slocum, owner of Ted
dy the rtoan, previous to the deciding
of the 2:17 pace here to-day. It looks
very much now as if the stranger was
sailing under false colors. Before the
racing began Secretary Kelly received a
telegram from W. A. Goucher, secretary
of the National Trotting Association,
saying that Walter K, by Happy Pilot,
won a race at Elkh^m, Wisconsin, on
July 4, and Is owned by a Milwaukee
horseman. J. Brown, driver and .part
owner of the Walter K racing here/stated
to-day in the stand that he purchased the
pacer at Meridian, Miss., last October
from Milwaukee parties, paying 1300. Wuite
evidently there .is a broken spoke some
where.
In the swag-ger number on this after
noon's card Walter K started under pro

heats the Alabama horse would not
square away and pace, just getting inside
the red bunting on both occasions, the
winner turning up in Bob, driven by \V.

tamed down, taking the three following
heats in rag time.
In the lust trip around the oval King

The second heat of the Paris fours was

and for the same charge.
"Doc" "Weatherly was the first witness
examined yesterday. He said he had been
asked by Chretien to give the name of an
attorney in England to whom Chretien
could refer a matter, and he told Chretien
about Bennett & Walker. That was all
he knew of the case, he said. Then D, W.
Storror was called to tell of a cablegram
"Weatherly sent to Bennett telling him to
keep quiet and not get mixed up In the
business.
Rogers followed these two and declined
to answer, and then the testimony closed.
The Indictments for Chretien. Hansted
and I,atner are being drawn up by the
District Attorney. They will be filed Mon
day. Hansted Is in Nome, and the police
say they can locate Latner at any time
he is wanted.
The charge of obtaining money under
fal.se- pretenses will rest on the fact that
Chretien assigned the estate as a sort of
gold brick to Jake Rauer fcr the money
which "Young Dutchy" was to take to
Nome with him, but part of which went
into Chretien's pockets.
The third man is I-atner, who will be in
dicted in the same manner as "Dutchy"
Hansted, or "Dutchy," Is another can
didate for indictment. His charge will
be based on the general conspiracy to de
fraud, which under section 530 of the Penal
Code is larceny, and may be felony or mis
demeanor, according to the amount se
cured by the fraud. In the case of the
Sullivan estate the amount is well above
the felony mark, so It will be a State's
prison offense If ever "Dutchy" can be
brought down from Nome for trial.
and what Rogers had done could always
be construed as a compromise. The Jur
ors were not satisfied, however. Th*y
discussed the- matter thoroughly and this
conclusion was reachedâ that they will
hear Mr. Byington again on Monday. If
he can convince them that an indictment
under the present evidence could not be
made good before the court, they will
not bring one, but instead will draw up.
a memorial to the Bar Association setting
forth the facts In the case and ask that
some befitting action be taken.
The grand jurors have but one opinion
in the matter and their votes showed
plainly what that was. They refer back
to the time that Rogers swore before
Judge Troutt that he had received no
money whatever from any person or for
any purpose, in his whole connection with
the case, and yet the testimony shows
clearly that he received at least ?SCO from
f7^Â» NOTHER afternoon's session has

the Chretien matters, as it ad

without results, however, for three wit

for Indicting him anyway and letting the

Of the other men on the list, the
' jury decided to bring two indictments
i against Chretien, one for forgery and
the other for obtaining money under
false pretenses. The forgery charge
will be based on the utterance of papers
purporting to be signed by a true heir to
the estate of Joseph Sullivan. The signa
tures themselves may or may not be for
gery, for there may still be a question
whether or not there is a John Sullivan !

It seems to be conceded that/' Russia is strong
enough to play a lone hand in China and has a right
to try it. but all the same the other powers will ob

out by^ way of enjoying the game'and having a share
in the stakes.
The suggestion thnt none of the civilized powers

more valuable if accompanied by some plan for pre
venting enterprising men from setting up plants to
manufacture the goods in China itself.

THE CHINESE TERROR.
r\ S the great mass of information concerning
/ y Chinese matters given out since the terrible
outbreak of the Boxers at Peking is naturally
infused with the feeling of horror roused by reported
massacres, and so colored as to be subject to the sus
picion of misrepresentation, it is worth while to give
attention to such accounts of the Chinese as were
written before the feeling of abhorrence was aroused.
A valuable contribution of that kind to the subject
has just appeared in the \rork of A. R. Colquhoun,
who has made extensive travels in China and is
familiar with the situation that prevailed in Peking
up to the time of the insurrection.
He attributes much of the disturbance in China to
j the actions of the European nations in grasping for
j Chinese territory immediately after the war with
I Japan. After referring to the harmony which had
existed among the members of the foreign legations
at Peking up to the formation of the French and
Russian understanding, he says: "From that date
commenced a change. The happy family circle was
I broken up into cliques; mines and countermines were
I sprung; intrigues of all sorts spread bitterness and
! jealousy. The old-fashioned chronic questions of
j transit and audience gave way to fierce threats and
j demands for territory and special concessions. The
French and Russian Ministers alternated their daily
visits to the Tsung-li Yamen, and bullied, stormed
and threatened, until the Chinese â who looked in vain
for help from England â were completely cowed. > A
, rude awakening, indeed, from the old days of Sleepy
Hollow diplomacy. Concession hunters, syndicates
and adventurers flocked to Peking as vultures to a
carcass."
These aggressions naturally gave rise to discon
tents, which the Government was powerless to re
move or, to hold in subjection. The members of the

PERSONAL MENTION.
VICTORY in the first contest over the telephone
tax ordinance is with the people and the law
against the tax-shirking corporation. Presi
dent Sabin and Secretary Eaton having been ar
ie>ted as officers of the telephone company and
charged with violating the ordinance requiring a re
port of the number of telephone machines in use, and
al?o with failure to pay the license on nickel-in-the
slot attachments, met the charge by demurrer. The
case was heard by Judge Fritz. His decision over
ruled the demurrer and sustained the validity of both
the ordinances. The victory is therefore one of con
siderable importance, and will be so regarded not
only by the people but by the corporation that has
met with defeat in its efforts to evade the law.
In the fight against the ordinances the corporation
attorneys raised three points. First, that the ordi
nance imposing a tax on nickel-in-the-slot machines
does not apply to telephones: second, that it was re
pealed by the later ordinance providing that for each
telephone instrument a quarterly license of 50 cents
muÂ«t be paid: and. third, that the telephone corpora
tion has a license to transact telephone business and
that it cannot do so without the use of the nickel-in
the-slot attachment.
In overruling: each of these points the decision of
the Judge is clear, logical and consistent with the law.
He upheld the plain meaning of the original ordi
nance that nickc!-:n-the-?!ot machines shall be taxed,
declared that a slot attachment is not an essential
part of a telephone instrument and is therefore rightly
subject to a separate tax, and. finally, that the tele
phone corporation car.not claim that such slot ma
chines are necessary to the conduct of a telephone
business. On that point the Judge said: "The court
is very clearly of the opinion, as has been stated be
fore, that the nickel-in-the-slot attachments are not
ncccÂ«ari'y a part of the telephone business; that it
is of great ns? istance to the telephone company in the
collection of money, r.ut it is clearly possible that the
company can carry en its business without the as
siftar.ee of these nickel-in-the-slot attachments. To
cite an instance in that regard: A cigar dealer or a
saloon-keeper pays a license to conduct his business
as such cigar dealer or saloon-keeper: he is also
taxed and pays a license upon each and every nickel
in-the-slot machine he has in his place. It is no more
necessary for the telephone company to have nickel
in-the-slot attachments than it is necessary for the
cigar dealer or saloon-keeper to have nickel-in-the
slot machines in his place of business."
There will be an sppeal to a higher court, of
course, for tax-shirking is too profitable a trick to be
abandoned so long as it is possible to evade the law.
The telephone corporation will fight a long time
rather than pay taxes. Nevertheless the decision of
Judge Fritz is one on which the public can be con
gratulated. The Judge has done his duty in defiance
of all the influence and power of a giant corporation,
and merits the cordial approval of the people.
THE TELEPHONE TAX CASES
PROBATE REFORM.
OUT of the exposure, confession and punish
ment of the wretches who have criminally
worked the probate courts there should issue
a reform that will touch others who work the same
courts professionally. After all, Chretien took only
a cut across lots to the same result that is reached
by the regular road, as far as estates and rightful heirs
are concerned.
Indeed, it is probable that Chretien learned the cut
off by long following the regular road.
Estates remain in court, under deliberate and long
drawn out probate, their distribution is delayed and
tl.eir substance wasted, until the heirs find themselves
despoiled as effectually as if the victims of the perjury,
forgery and substitution of which Chretien stands
convicted.
The dockets of our courts are full of cases in pro
bate in which rich estates have dwindled down to the
size of the professional fees and court costs. â¢
The Judges themselves have been moved to rebuke
these abuses, and it :s time that the bench put a stop
to them.
Having exposed the criminal processes by which
cftatcs are robbed by fraud, we now insist that there
be reform in the mcar.s by which they are deplete-i
through regular proce=?es. This reform involves the
exposure of the system by which certain attorneys
search for ways and means to break into rich estates
and fracture wills thu dispose of them.
Trie history of the estate of Dr. Merritt in Oak
land may be taken as a sample. In such cases a sort
of joint stock attack is made. The lay promoters get
a certain percentage, and the professional adviser gets
another, the estate gets depleted, and the rightful
beneficiaries get tired.
ONE of the most attractive programmes ever put
forward by a contributor to the Merchants'
Association Review is contained in an article
in the current number on "A Park System for San
Francisco," by George Hansen. The project is alto
gether too extensive to be considered as a practical
proposition, at any'rate for the present, but none the
less ft merits consideration as a suggestion of a com
prehensive programme along which improvements
may be made for years to come.
As a first point of importance to be noted in plan
ning new parks and boulevards Mr. Hansen directs
attention to the lack of direct and commodious com
munication between different sections of the muni
cipality. He says: "Market street should have
swung into Mission at Eighth street, thence into San
Jose avenue, and should have widened into a grand
boulevard southward through San Mateo County.
Instead of that, the latter avenue narrows at one place
into a thoroughfare of sixty feet width. Montgom
ery avenue should have ended at the Ferry building.
The now proposed widening of Washington street, to
relieve the congestion of traffic in this overcrowded
district, will be as much of a makeshift as the unfor
tunate cut through Second street. The former will
not connect the* manufacturing districts with North
Beach any more than the latter opened traffic toward
the Potrero."
For the purpose of serving the double benefit of
parks and of broad avenues it is suggested that a
park area should be provided for the district south
of Mission street on lines similar to the panhandle.
These thoroughfares, Mr. Hansen says, would touch
the manufacturing districts, full room would be given
for trucks and traffic during the week, and they would
serve on holidays for use as boulevards, while at all
times they would afford shade on hot days and recrea
tion grounds in the evening.
for the rest Mr. Hansen would have the city save
as parks all the commanding and picturesque sites of
the city. "Every knoll of prominence, every piece of
ground expensive to build upon, should be set aside
for a reservation." Telegraph Hill is cited as the
most important place of that kind, but other points
of scenic beauty are also specified as localities that
should be saved for the park system.
Another interesting feature of the programme is a
suggestion for connecting the city with the country
to the south. Mr. Hansen says: "Neither Mission
road, with its severe artificial grade, nor San Jose
avenue, with a double line of car tracks upon its nar
row width, affords a desirable connection and outlet
to our neighboring county. The best way to overcome
this difficulty is to establish a grand boulevard en
circling the hills of the Potrero and swinging around
Bernal Heights, entirely ignoring the present line of
the abortive San Bruno road. This boulevard should
seek the contours of Islais Creek, with its grand suc
cession of noble outlines. In this creek San Fran
cisco, and more especially the Mission, finds the de
velopment of wonderful scenery. This boulevard
would traverse property which is now marketed at a
discount, and it would turn ever)' foot along its line
into desirable holdings."
It will be conceded that the programme is attrac
tive. There is a possibility of making San Francisco
the most picturesque city in the world and providing
for easy access to all her noble hills. How best .to
accomplish that is a subject that we cannot too soon
begin to study, for every year of delay will of course
increase the ultimate cost of any improvement under
taken.
A GRAND PARK PROGRAMME.
By way of a, pleasing summer variation from the
usual run of editorials on the political situation and
the war in China, the press of New England is en
gaged in discussing whether the girls of to-day make
as {?ood wives as those "of fifty years ago, and it is
satisfactory to note there is a consensus that they do.
GREAT MODERN^ACTIVITY 'IN THE EXTENSIVE BUSINESS OF FURNISH
ING READY MADE GOVERNMENTS FOR OTHER PEOPLES.
BY EX-SENATOR FRANK H. SHORT.
UNQUESTIONABLY one of the
most extensive lines of business
activity in modern times has
been and is the furnishing by one
people or nation to another ready-made
governments.,
This, business can hardly be called mod
ern except In so* far as it has Been car
ried on upon new lines and for alleged
new purposes; otherwise it is the most
ancient and primitive occupation of man.
There has hardly been a nation In all his
tory that has not engaged in this practice
and that has not also resented it when
there has been an attempt to force it to
take its own medicine. The Greeks suc
cessfully resisted it at Marathon and un-
I successfully attempted it at Syracuse. The
Romans successfully opposed It at Metu
rua and successfully upheld. and enforced
Hfcon a hundred bloody battle-fields. In
comparatively modern times it found its
â¢ most legitimate and successful fields in
partitioning and dividing among the
anointed of the old world the pastoral do
minion of the savage tribes of the newly
discovered Western world. In its original
stages this was hardly the furnishing of
government, but was merely appropriating
territory but little* occupied and indefinite
ly possessed; but It ripened into a wider
field, until It was high tide In the history
of colonial governments near the middle
of the eighteenth century.
The imperial system of government was
most complete, permanent and universal
under imperial Rome. It was most widely
diffused Just before the Revolutionary
war, when England. Spain and France
held undisputed dominion over the West
ern world. It reached Its Don Quixotic
and most absurd stage when two Kings
} by divine right divided the world between
j them. Why they divided it I can never
understand; it would have been so much
more sensible for each to have taken it
al L
] The policy originally was avowedly for
the glory and benefit of the conquering
power. In its later development it has
been largely changed to a policy claimed
for the benefit of the conquered or the
governed people. Nations and individuals
have done many noble and unselfish
| things. That one nation ever took and
l.governed another for the other's profit and
good nobody believes, but It has been so
pretended a thousand times, which shows
that we have not only advanced in many
other things, but have also greatly devel
oped in hypocrisy. The new world proved
a reactionary field in the line of govern
ment by the consent of the governing, and
very soon It repudiated the governments
so kindly furnished it by the old world
monarchs, and one by one the communi
ties of the Western world took their places
j among the "free and independent nations
i of the earth." This rendered It obviou|ly
necessary for those nations government-
I ally inclined not only to govern them
i selves but to govern others to look
I around for a new world to conquer. But
not finding any, they did not foolishly,
like Alexander, give up in despair, but
â¢ concluded to govern again the older parts
| of the old world. And It Is this new phase
j of an old subject that we are to consider.
I Not wishing to be theoretical, but prac
tical, v/e will consider, not. Is It rlght?'ls
it founded in principle? or la it just? but,
will It pay or has it paid?
It may be conceded that Imposed gov
ernments are not always worse than those
they have supplanted. That an Imposed
j government Is always a bad government
cannot be doubted, but in comparison as
to badness it may not be the worst.
Imposed, or carpetbag governments,
can only be excused on the ground of tem
porary necessity, or the existence: locally,
of Fuch a low and depraved condition of
men that any form of government will be
better than they will give themselves. It
may thus be excused; whether justified.
Is another question. A comparison be
tween carpetbag governments Is always
a comparison between bad governments.
The government in Canada, Australia.
( India and Kgypt may be pointed to with
| pride in comparison with the government
in Cuba under Spanish rule, or other mis
managed colonial enterprises, or even the
degenerate Oriental form of government
previously existing. But it Is not, and will
not be pretended that they are comparable
with any respectable form of self govern
ment, or that they are capable of develop
| ment Into really high or meritoriously
i good governments at all. We will not have
to argue with nny American who is an
American that the only form of govern
ment correct In principle or true In form
Is a Â«elf government, and local self gov
ernment at that. Such governments have
been demonstrated as capable of develop
ing the greatest national strength and
unity, and the greatest individual liberty
and advancement. Self government is not
tested by its form, but by whether it is
by one people for themselves, or by one.
people for another, un the one hand.
â¢ it may be conceded that Imposed Rovern
i ments are not always worse than those
they have supplanted, or immeasurably
bad. On the other iiand. it cinnot be con
tended that they are good governments.
1 or can ever become good governments In
| principle or in fact. We may, therefore,
discuss the question, do they pay ttwse
i who impose them? Not do they pay those
I they are imposed upon, because that
I would be a useless discussion. Whether
they pay the governed or not signifies
nothing because whether they wish such
a government or not they cannot escape
the benefactors of their loving but in
sistent fellow men. But does it pay one
people or one government to Impose ita
go\ernmcnt or authority upon another.
It is not our intention to enter into a de
tailed discussion of this matter, since thin
article is written for another purpose, and
the title and previous remarks are but a
j prelude to the consideration of another
| subject.
It may be admitted that England has
long pursued the policy of furnishing gov
ernments to those who did not object too
forcibly, and with moderate success: and
that England's wealth, prestige nnd power
to-day place them In the front rank of
nations. But she does not possess greater
wealth, prestige or iwwer than the I'nitel
States, and nothing like their national
unity or strength.- The conditions of .ill
other' colonial powers Is that they are
either weakened, dying or dead. With
the sole exception of England, the only
nations to-day possessing vigor, strength
or the elements of national greatness are
those whose characteristics are chiefly
central and national, and whose really Im
portant possessions are all contiguous.
To-day the nations of the world stand
contemplating the greatest problem In the
line of deciding to Impose or not to Im
pose a form of government upon a people
that the world ever contemplated. â¢ In
all things except military strength and
active governmental functions. China to
day has the right of all nations to be
called a nsijion. It was a nation before
the Egyptians, the Chaldeans or the Jews
had founded those governments, some of
which are now but dimlv traceable In
our histories of antiquity. Some of China's
greatest national achievements had been
accomplished, and some of her greatest
philosophers had taught and passed away,
before our ancestors commenced to run
wild in the woods of Saxony and Brittany.
Continuously and coherently wltbr a dis
tinct civilization, systems of religion,
philosophers and schools, the Chinese peo
ple have within themselves, nnd for them
selves, continued to maintain a govern
ment with greater length of years and
stability of character than any other
people-. So much so that they alone can
claim a contemporaneous existence with
all other races and all other nations, and
to embrace all history. But China admit
tedly has not progressed. She has been
content within herself and for herself to
pursue the even tenor of her wav.
Whether this was wise or unwise, ad
mittedly, according to the law of nations,
was nobody's business but her own. If
she wanted her own religion and nobody
else's that was a matter for her: others
could proffer her, perhaps should proffer
her theirs, but could not and should not
attempt to force her to accept.
If, Instead of modern Inventions and
modern Improvements she preferred her
own antiquated ways and methods, un
doubtedly the right lay with her to
choose. But being an existing nation, but
supposed to possess neither natural re
resentment nor national strength, nations
have for years treated her as beneath
contempt, not according her the respect
due the living or the dead. In fact, it !Â¦Â»
pretty near true that China as a nation
has been for a long time dead, but was
unconscious of the fact. The same as
sumption as to the Chinese people has re
cently proved to be quite erroneous. The
world stands amazed at what has hap
pened, horrified at what probably has
happened. If all that now appears to be.
true Is true, history furnishes no paral
lel to the awful disregard for the rlghfs
and comity of nations and of humanity
that has occurred in China. Nothing that
has previously occurred or could have oc
curred would excuse or palla*? it. That
it must be avenged, and that blood must
atone for blood, nobody doubts. The Chi
nese nation must pay for Its complaisance
If not Its connivance. But beyond that,
what then? It may be in the fullness of
time, and In the great aggregation of
things, it will work to a beneficial end.
But for us and for our children, what
good can come of this rousing of on>?
third of the human race, and the awful
blood atonement that may follow?
We are told there ore markets there.
What kind of markets and for whom?
The Chinese labor In Its skill, industry
nnd Imitations equals any other on earth,
as oil of- us who 'have observed It know.
That as a. producer by labor, it Is upon
an equality with all others. That as a
consumer. It is no more at the most In
the proportion of one to five is also evi
dent. Does anybody doubt that if China
is Â¦ opened up to competition with the
world's labor It will open up and com
pete? Docs anybody doubt that they can
acquire a* good machinery and operate
It as well as anvbody else? "Where, then.
Is tne safe and permanent market for
labor? Where the benefit to the rest of
mankind? The opening up of China for a
market for the worlds labor is about as
sane a proposition as cuttinjc the levy of
a reservoir with a water levee ten feet
above an adjacent ditch to drain the
water from the ditch Into the reservoir.
Some special commodities we may fur
nish China, but whenever the rest of the
world commences to supply China with
the standard products of labor and dem
onstrates that It can permanently hoM
the market. It will be time for the world
to take a rest and stop going round.
An American market for American labor
has proven pood In the past and la safa
for the future. But above alt thlnsja, we
should not think we can long sell the
products of American labor to the most
imitative and in time equally skillful anl
the cheapest and most servile In tm*
world. But China Is likely to be openel
up. Thousands of foreigners have beta
massacred, including probably the Mint*
ters, envoys of all nations. Doubtless a
great and" peculiarly deplorable war wi.l
follow. Hundreds of million? of dollar*
will be expended and thousands of guilty
men and thousands of innocent men, wo
men and children will perish
In summing up who Is to blame, can it
all justly be charged to the Manchurian
fanatics and assassins? Have the nations
accorded to the Chinese nation and the
Chines- people treatment comparable wit ii
what they exact for themselves and us-
Drily accord to each other? Since th*
opium war. which for diabolical commer
cialism stands unrivaled, ami by which
th-it deadVi- druif was forced upon the
Chinese nonatlol big or .little, has pre
tended to respect the plainest rights ot

THE Democratic platform this year contains
some features more objectionable to Democrats
than that of 1S96.
Certain features in it indicate the insidious invasion
of the party councils by those sinister principles
which, pretending the elevation of man, mean the de
struction of government.
At the close of our Revolution there were expressed
some extreme views on the subject of government.
The period of incubation of a representative Democ
racy, which occurred under the old Confederacy, had
by 1789 produced a public opinion that was the
matrix of the constitution. That opinion favored just
what 'Jefferson wrote into his first inaugural, which
was the Democratic creed until 1896, when the party
was inoculated by a strange virus, made up of a. mix
ture of the views of Fourier, Karl Marx arrcl the
anarchists, socialists and nihilists, who, while differing
in motives and methods, all focus and agree up ! on the
destruction of government in all its existing forms.
Inasmuch as the Kansas City platform accuses the
Republican party of imperial views and sounds the
alarm to rouse public fear over such a change in our
system of government as imperialism implies, it 13
well to see what change is introduced by carrying the
Democratic platform into effect. .
In i8\>5 the party was toying with the influence
which is against all government, and gratified it by
proposing to destroy the courts and take away the
judicial protection of property. That was gratifying
to all the nihilistic cults in the country, for, as
we have said, they all agree upon the destruction of
government. â
But the party in 1896 could not be persuaded to
adopt the phraseology of the destroyers, which they
have selected as a lure to the American voter, because
it flatters him by ascribing to him the capacity to act
executively, legislatively and judicially. At Kansas
City, however, this last step was taken and the plat
form demands "direct legislation." That is the refer
endum. It was proposed to the Populist National
Convention of 1892 by a small anarchist and socialist
group therein, but was rejected. The Populists in
1896 actopted it, however, and now, four years later,
the Democracy takes it from them.
Direct legislation means something, and what it
means should be inquired into. Its purpose was
amply divulged in the stormy discussion of it which
agitated the Populist party during the four years in
which that organization was falling under the in
fluence of the furies and fusionists who are now sup
porting Mr. Bryan. ,
It mean?, primarily, the abolition of Congress and
the formulation of legislation by direct vote of the
people. Its advocates found it easy to get converts
to the substitution of Congress, but they found that
even then the courts and the constitution were in the
way. The courts pass upon acts of Congress, and it
found obnoxious to the constitution they are void.
The real quarrel of the proponents of direct legislation
being with the constitution, they expanded their at
t;:ck so as to leave no check upon direct legislation.
It is to be sacred. No judicial limitation is upon it.
It takes the place of Congre??, the courts and the
constitution. If the courts survive it. their decisions
are not to stand unless ratified by direct popular vote.
In another respect an important constitutional check
is removed. The system abolishes the veto.
It will be seen that the Kansas City platform pro
poses to complete the work of destruction that was
outlined at Chicago. When its policy is in action all
judicial protection of the rights of person and prop
j erty will be destroyed, and these will be subject to the
I passions of an inflamed majority.
Mr. JcfTerson was a stout defender of rule by the
majority, but he by no means ignored the rights of
the minority,* lie recognized the fact that, by taking
sovereignty from one and conferring it upon the
majorit3\ there was no change wrought in the nature
of man, and that the" majority might act the tyrant
as the king had. Therefore, in the Declaration of
Independence, he set up the doctrine of the "inalien
able rights" of manâ rights sacred against kings and
majorities alike â and in his first inaugural he said
that the rule of the majority to be right must be rea
sonable. Under our system the courts, and they
! alone, rationalize the acts of the majority as these
I finally appear in the laws passed by Congress. But
j the Democrats propose to do away with the courts
I and leave no authority to rationalize, to make rea
1 sonable. the rule of the majority.
It is the most revolutionary proposition that has
; yet been made. Within its possibility anarchy
j marches, torch in hand, and nihilism sneaks with poi
j son in its fist for use in the springs whereat popular
I government has been refreshed.
The Democratic army marches to battle crying
I "Down with Imperialism," with its purpose written
! to substitute anarchy for government.
ABOLISHING GOVERNMENT.
Government made use of the usual tactics of '. the
.weak, and tried by various evasions to placate both
the foreigners and the turbulent element among the
Chinese. Like every one else who was in the empire,
Mr. Colquhoun saw -the alarming condition of affairs
and did what he could to arouse attention to the rap
idly augmenting danger.
Speaking of the situation he said in 1899: "Entire
provinces, especially in the Yangtse region, are seeth
ing with revolt, which meets with hardfy any opposi
tion. Nominally still alive and in full operation, the
organism of the Chinese Government is hardly per
ceptible, and is unable to cope with foreign aggres
sions, barely sufficing to keep in restraint the three
hundred and fifty millions of its own people. The
most cursory glance at any map showing the railway
schemes and spheresof interest or influence, or what
ever they may be called, of foreign powers must shat
ter any belief in a responsible or organic Government
in China. The trail of the foreigner is on the land
from north to south. The Western powers have come
to stay, and the extension of the present spheres is
merely a matter of time. Internally the forces making
for rebellion on a grand scale are daily gaining
strength, and once they realize that no power exists
to suppress them will usurp in vast regions the office
of government. In a word, China is being dismem
bered and broken up."
We are perceiving in a startling way the fulfillment
of those words. The Chinese Government has gone
to pieces. The "civilized powers have entered the
empire to stay. Whether they will divide it or at
tempt to govern it as a whole is something which
events will be more potent in determining than all
the plans of diplomatists. In the meantime it is to
be remembered throughout all the difficulties that will
confront civilized men in settling the enormous
problem that it was their own aggressions and greed
that precipitated the conflict.

TITLE OF STRATTON'S MINE
ATTACKED BY A SUIT
DENVER, July 20.â Edwin D. Chadick
and W. K. Trasher of Chicago submitted
to the executive council uf tne American
Federation of Labor to-day u plan which
they are confident will result in the speedy
settlement of the great building and
trades strike in Chicago. The council,
after listening to the propositions of th*e
gentlemen and reading the documents
they had brought to show that they rep
resented many of the wealthiest men in
Chicago, appointed Messrs. Kidd and Len
non to investigate the proposal thorough
ly.
Mr. Chadick and Mr. Trasher repre
sent a new company, known as the Labor
and Guarantee Association. Neither they
nor the members of the council will
divulge the plan proposed.
"All 1 can say in regard to the matter,"
said Mr. Chadick. "Is that the associa
tion proposes to act as an intermediary
between trr.i>loyers and employes, and
our method of procedure will be submitted
to the council In a full report by the sub
committee appointed for that matter. We
proceed on lines entirely different^ from,
anything btfore su^g-ested. We propose
to introduce an entirely new method of
dealing with labor troubles.
â¢â¢We want tne indorsement of the coun
cil." continued Air. tnaoicK, "tor without
It the plan and the purposes of the asso
ciation would fail. \V> are particularly
interested in the Chicago building trades
strike and cannot make known our plan
until we Ket the indorsement, for fear of
beinc forestalled in Chicago. Our lirsi
work, cf course, would be in Chicago, but
the association would, if successful, ex
tend its scope so as to make it national in
character."
Vice President Max Morris, who was
Instructed to confer with Superintendent
Dyer, of the Colorado and Southern Hall
road, in reference to the trouble between
the Order of Railway Telegraphers and
that company, reported to the council that
the superintendent had agreed to meet a
committee from the Railway Telegraph
ers" Union, but the committee must be
from men connected with his road. Mr.
Morris believes that the conference, will
result in the adjustment of existing diffi
culties.
The council took up the matter of the
American agents, whose charter was re
voked at the last convention of the fede
ration, and by resolution President Gomp>
ers was instructed to notify all local labor
unions that thpy will not be allowed rep
resentation in the federation as long as
they remain in any way connected with
the American agents, which the council
declares is not a bona fide labor organiza
tion. The tjboo in the association em
braces local sales agents of small manu
factured articles, insurance agents and
agents of all lines of that character.

PLAN FOR THE
SETTLEMENT OF
CHICAGO STRIKE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. July 20.â Drafts, on
Chicago and New York banks will be Is
sued to depositors in the mint at San
Francisco and the assay office at Seattle.
Director Roberts of the mint has Isaued
this order for the benefit of returning gold
miners. The ordinary course is to pay
gold coin in San Francisco and coin or
checks on the local depositories at Seattle.
When the assay office was opened at Seat
tle payments were made by Eastern
drafts exclusively, as the depositors there
desired, but the San Francisco commer
cial and banking interests protested,
maintaining it was discrimination in favor
of Seattle, since Eastern exchange on the
coast is usually worth about II 25 per
thousand premium. This attracted the
miners with their bullion to Seattle. On
account of San Fraacisco's objection this
plan was abandoned, although at some in
convenience to the CJovernment as well aa
to the local public. Now the two cities
have been placed on an equal basis.
The objection to doing this ordinarily is
that it amounts to a transfer of funds
from the sub-treasury of Chicago and of
New York to the sul>-treasury In San
Francisco. When a payment is made
there in gold coin for bullion received
there is no accumulation of money as
would ordinarily result were payment
made by drafts on Chicago and New York
For the present, however, the Government
will have to make such large disburse
ments in San .'Francisco on account of
troops equipping- for China that this ob
jection does not hold. Probably 520,ojo (KW
will be paid out there in this manner
within the next four months.

WASHINGTON. July 20.â It is under

Wood have agreed on September 15 as the
time for holding the election in Cuba for

On the return of General Wood to Cuba
he will confer with the leaders of the
Cuban people as to the detail? of the elec
tion and as to what restrictions, if any,
thoiild be placed upon universal suffrage
In the inland. It is now hoped that the
constitutional convention will be held be
fore the end of the year, and if possible
as early as October li" Thpre is no doubt
that any constitution that may be formu
lated will be scrutinized carefully by the
Pr^ider.t. and r-ossibly by Cont?resÂ«. be
fore it is allowed to go into operation, for
it is the wttled conviction of th* officials
that Cuba should not be permitted to make

through the I'nited States, nor should the
people be allowed to involve the island in

FLOUR FROM YOKOHAMA.
Is Produced Much Cheaper Then?
Than on This Coast.
PORTLAND, Or., July 20.â J. C. Robin
son, a well-known mill man, has received
a sample of flour from a mill in Yoko
hama. The flour was manufactured from
a cargo of wheat sent from here several
months- ago and to all appearances Is a
first-class article. Along with the sample,
over Mhlch the Japanese are 5Â«Â«emingly
quite proud, comes the statement that the
actual cost of the manufactured article
was on the basis of $2 30 per barrel at a
Pacific Coast point. As J2 50 per barrel is
the lowest figure yet reported for flour
sent to the Orient, it would seem from
this that the Japanese were in a fair way
to become active competitors for the flour
trade of the Orient.

cf J. A. McGrath of Santa i'lara and a
nephew of p. h. McGrath of the State
r.card of Examiners' Office, were drowned
in th<Â» waters of Monteroy Hay at Camp
Goodali. about five mikÂ« frum this city.
The drowned p* rsons, with many other?.
were bathing at the beach and shortly
fcofore the unfortunate occurrence Miss
Downing. Mis? Dunn. Miss McGrath. John
McGrath and Eddie McAuliSfe ventured
*j\it about ZC5 feet from the shore and
before they knew it struck a large hole
which had bÂ«Â«n washed out by the tide
and strong undercurrent.
La vary Renshaw went to their issist
ano-? and he nimself was soon in danger.
S. Shot well and his son of Riverside, who
had been to the beach clam digging, went
to the assistance of the drowninz people
and so<->ri hai Renshaw, McAiiliffe and
Miss McGrath safe on the shore. The
othfr three unfortunates were beyond as
sistance and boob sank out of sight.
Scon after the news was brought to
Watsonville many people drove tA Camp
Goodali ar.d began a patrol of the beach,
hoping that incoming breakers would
wash a?hÂ«:re the bodies of the dead, but
their wi?h<?Â« were in rain. .
To-night a large force of men is patrol
ling tTie beach from near Moss Landing
to ne.ir Apto?. It is not likely that the
bodies will be washed ashore, as the bot
t. :r. of the bay at this point contains
many deep gullies and shelves filled with
ee-aweed, which would block the passage
of the bodies to the shore.
Your.g McAalUXe and M!fs McGrath had
a very narrow escape from drowning an-1
Dr. Wfctlera and his assistants worked on
them pome time before consciousness was
restored.
M:?s Downing was raised at Camp
Goodali. her parests having managed the
resort for rr.at#- years. The McGrath
family, with their cousin. Miss Dunn, had
recently come from Santa Clara to s;x?nd
a fÂ«w weeks at the seashore.
There are spots along the Camp Goodali
beach which have bee,n considered dan
gerous for many years, and the cr.e where
the drowning took place Is the most dan
gerous of them all. Th<p =ad accident to
the young people ha? caused a eloom to
spread over the entire community.

LIVES LOST
IN THE BAY
OF MONTEREY
LEXINGTON', Ky., July 20.â The Dem
ocratic State Convention adjourned short
ly before 4 o'clock this morning after an
all-night session, near the close of which
Governor Beckham was nominated for
Governor to - fill the unexplred term of
William Goebel. who was assassinated
last February. During the night the com
mittee sent word to the convention re
peatedly that they could not report until
to-day, but the delegates refused to ad
journ. Finally the reports began to come
in, after midnight.
It was 2 a. m. when Senator Blackburn
presented the report of resolutions, which
was adopted.
The resolutions indorse "The magnifi
cent platform adopted by the national
convention at Kansas City, and also the
splendid ticket nominated by said conven
tion." declare that the Democratic party
â¢"has always advocated and still does that
all elections shall be fairly conducted and
the results, honestly ascertained," and
continues:
We r*-comnÂ»end that the election law of 1S9S
(known as the Goebel law), which was en
aeterl to prevent the repetition of well-known
Hepublican frauds in certain districts of this
.State and which was a marked Improvement
upon the then existing law, but which has not
proved sufficient for that purpose, be amended
to secure this end so thoroughly that the most
hypercritical can find no excuse for charging
fraud or unfairness to our party !n the con
duct of elections. Until such amendments can
be enacted by the General Assembly, we de
clare that the Republican party shall have rep
resentation en both the State and all the coun
ty boards of election commissioners. We de
clare to the world that the mob and the as
sassin shall not be the arbitrators of the rights
of citizens of Kentucky, nor ahall the penalty
of an appeal to the !aw and the regular con
stituted authorities be death at the hands of
assassins. Law and order must and shall pre
vail in Kentucky.
At 2:15 a. m. the order for nominations
for Governor Was reached. Congressman
Wheeler presented the name of Governor
Beekham. A wild demonstration of en
thusiasm followed. When order was re
stored the names of Judge Black and
Judge James P. Tarvin were presented.
The names of Judge McCreary, Lewis,
Smith, Pryor and Garnett. who "had been
pressed hard as candidates, were now
presented.
When the call of counties was almost
completed Charles Metcalf withdrew thÂ«
name of Judge Black and moved that the
nomination of Beckham be made by ac
clamation. Judge Tarvin withdrew his
name and seconded the motion. Beckham
was nominated by acclamation.
Then followed a wild scene in the hall,
while Beckham was being escorted from
the rear of the platform to the footlights.
Resolutions Indorse the National
Ticket and Recommend the
Amendment of the Goebel
Election Law. x

CALL HEADQUARTERS. CAMP
O'RYAN. SAXTA CRUZ. July 20.â But
two more days remain of the camp and
the cadets are making a great ef
fort to crowd all the pleasure they
can in what remains of their va
cation. The life In camp and the
many pleasures enjoyed by the cadets
during the past week have had such bene
ilcial effect on the boys that they woul'd
be willing to extend their stay in this city
for another week. It will be with regret
that they return to their work and
school, but they will do so with the
knowledge of having spent a delightful
week in the country and the expectation
of renewing their fun next year. *
To-night a dance was given in the Dol
phin boathouse under the auspices of the
Lrst sergeants of the regiment. The floor
was crowded with dancers who tripped
the light fantastic until 11 o'clock. Ser
geant Glennon'of Company B was floor
director; W. Carey of Company N, First
Sergeant J. T. Ltonohue, Company D,
First4Â£ergeant Fitzgerald of H and First
Sergi-ant Fitzgerald of C were his assist
ants.
Lieutenant F. McCarthy and First Ser
geant Jack Donohue and Bob Laydon of
U drove a party of ladles to Capitola and
Del Mar yesterday afternoon.
The baseball game between the field and
staff and the line officers is still a matter
of discussion /in camp. The adherents c
the former team are loud in their de
nunciation of Lieutenant Al Hanley.
who i they charge was prejudiced in
favor of the line officers because he was
of their number. According to many the
decisions rendered by Haniey were "atro
clous. He had eyes only for the good of
the line officers' team, and a c ; a result
the Held and staff suffered defeat. The
game did not reach a conclusion. In the
nfth inning, when Hanley called Colonel
Power out after the latter had made a
brilliant slide to rhird; retired Major Duf
fey on strikes before that player had had
time to lift his bat; declared Rev.
Father Kennedy, who was playing a hot
game at left field, out because "he did not
tag first while rounding the bases on a
three^base swat, the field and staff could
stand it no longer. Led by Dr. Morrlsey,
the members of that team made a rush
for Hanley and the latter had to beat a
hasty retreat. As no one brave enough
could be found to assume the vacant po
sition of umpire the game was closed. The
line officers' score was 13 to the field and
staffs 4, thanks to the good work done
by Lieutenant Hanley. The teams lined
up as follows:

The doctor played ball to-day and while

not be able to play the national game for

The "five deserters from L" enjoyed &
ride yesterday to Watsonville and wW
entertained there by Mrs. Donnelly
Captain Hopper was succeeded by Cap
tain Westplear a? officer of the day and
Lieutenant Al Hanley succeeded Lieuten
ant Dixon as officer of the guard. The
latter had forty prisoners to clean up
streets and the camp presented a tidy ap
pearance when their labors were con
cluded.
"General Funston" Farrell of L lodged
a complaint with the commanding officer
because his entire staff, which consists of
C. \V. Scanlon. A. Butler, J. Flynn, "Lieu
tenant" Watson and Ed Doling, were
thrown into the guardhouse. The gen
eral thought his staff was Immune from
street-cleaning duty.
Company A held another entertainment
in their street last night. Music, song and
recitations were rendered by the clever
members of the company. Refreshments
were served and the affair wag highly
successful.
Company D enjoyed a. very pleasant ex
cursion to Ben Lomond. Rowardennan and
Boulder Creek this afternoon. L^avlnp the
camp In two large buses, which were
hardly large enough to accommodate the
boys, they proceeded by a scenic road to
Boulder Creek, where they partook of a
hearty .lunch., which was arranped for
them by Rev. Father Cullen and JPrivaU
James Welsh.
The members of Company H held an
"at home" last night. The affair was
strictly invitational and was therefore ex.
elusive. Pies and soda water were served
in abundance and the young men Bang
themselves hoarse trying to be heard
above the harmonica playing of "Gunner"
Reilly. The programme consisted of
danctn? by Charles Quinn, songs by Mc-
Bearity; the rock-rollers' quartet, com
posed of Captain "Fighting Jack" Keit
ing. First Lieutenant O'Connor. Spcond
I-leutenant "Boss" Beasley and First Ser
geant Reilly, and remarks by Comedian
George Quinn. After the "shindii?" the
boys proceeded to make "rough house."
The corporal of the guard was called out
on three different occasions to subdue the
cadets, who were a? effervescent as the
soda water they drank. A number were
thrown into the guardhouse and cleaned
streets this morning as a penance for too
much exuberance. ' ,

MONEY LOANED ON
GRAIN IS TAXABLE
Decision of Yolo County Supervisors
Sitting as a Soard of
Equalization.
WOODLAND, July 20.â A question of
much Importance affecting the taxation
of money loaned on grain was to-day de
cided by the Yolo County Supervisors, sit
ting as a Board of equalization, in effect
that such money is assessable.
The Bank of Woodland was cited to ap
pear and show cause why It should not
be assessed for about $100,000 on promis
sory notes Secured by warehouse receipts
for grain. It was contended that such
notes are not taxable, for the reason that
by virtue of the provisions of section 4, ar
ticle XIII, constitution of the State of Cal
ifornia, the notes in question are obliga
tions by which a debt Is secured, and for
the purpose of taxation deemed an interest
In property given as security for their
payment.' and should not be separately
taxed.
The Deputy District Attorney, A. C.
Huston, to-day submitted a written opin
ion in the matter, in which he said:
This decision affects several hundred
thousands of dollars In this county, as the
other banks have filed applications for re
ductions from their assessments of such
property. Â«
If such notes are within the meaning of this
section, they are still, in my opinion, aJtess
able, for the reason that It is provided by this
section that when a debt, mortgage, deed cl
truFt, contract or other obligation by which a
debt la secured shall for purposes of taxation
be deemed and treated as an Interest in the
jiroperty affected thereby, the property affected
by such moragage, deed of trust, contract or
other obligation, less the value of such secur
ity, shall - be assessed and taxed to .the owner
of the property and the value of such security
shall be assessed and taxed to the owner
thereof.

ST. LOUIS. July 20.â A special to the
Post-Dispatch from New London, Mo.,
says:
George W. Roudebush, one of the special
examiners of the Pension Bureau, was
placed on the stand in the Jester trial to
day. He Identified the certificates and ap
plications for pension made by Alexander
Jester, alias W. A. Hill.
B. F. Wilkins of Norman, O. T., clerk
of the Second District Court, testified that
he knew the prisoner as W. A. Hill and
had assisted him in getting a pension and
also a divorce.
When first arrested at Shawnee, O. T.,
Jester claimed he was not Alaxander
Jester, who traveled through Kansas and
Missouri with Gilbert W. Gates.
The attorney for the prisoner made a
fight to keep out the pension papers, as
they prove conclusively that Jester had
been known under two names. The Judge
admitted the evidence and 'Â¦ the letters
Jester had written to the Pension Depart
ment and the application he made.
It was a decided victory for the State
and made the olu pri.sover look very sad.
In the following letter to the .Pension
Department, Jester explains how he as
sumed the name of Hill:
"Hill was nay own father's name. Jester
was mv stepfather's name. 1 was about
one and one-half years old when my
mother married Jester, andl went by tho
name of Alexander Jester until after tho
war closed, when I took up my own name.
Kespectfullv, W. A. HILL." -
Taken in connection with a divorce suit
In Oklahoma, it appears from the pension
papers read that Jester was married to
lielilah Jester probably in the fifties. She
went to Kansas and died In 1878. However,
on June 18. 1870, Jester swears he was mar
ried in Texas to Julia Reynolds, who bore
him three children. From her he secured
a divorce at Norman, O. T., on November
24. 1894. On May 24, 18CÂ«6, he was married
to Margaret E." Brown.
In a series of questions submitted to
Jester by H. Clay Evans, the Commis
sioner of Pensions, Jester claimed that he
had three children, while In fact he had
at least eight at the time the statement
was made. In the same series of ques
tions he made mention of only one wife,
while the court records show him married
three times at least.
J. E. Roark. W. S. Copp and Charles
Bates of Denton. Texas, testified that
they knew Jester In Texas under the name
of W. A. Hill.

With Absolutely Noth

LOS ANGELES, July 20.â There will be
no peaches or prunes exported from this
part of the State this year, according to
the statements of deciduous fruit growers.
President A. R. Sprague of the Southern
California Deciduous Fruit Exchange, in
an Interview says:
"There will be very Httle dried fruit in
this section this year except that which
comes from the north. There will be no
shipments of peaches or prunes.
"The apricot crop also Is very short;
only here and there is there a locality in
which the apricot crop approaches tho
average.
"This shortage, for the most part. Is
caused by most unseasonably warm
weather in January, followed by cold, but
not frosty, weather. The same weather
conditions exist in Arizona also.
"This condition of the deciduous fruit
crop is most disastrous to the Southern
California growers, because many of them
will have absolutely nothing to sell this
year. But the trees are now leafing out
and getting their usual appearance, so
that with a good rainfall during the com
ing season, we may hope for full crops
another year, except in such orchards as
have been killed or seriously Injured by
three years of drought."

The guests lost very little. The tavern
was constructed with wide verandas and
numerous hallways, so that escape from

G. W. Dearborn, the cashier, removed
all the books and valuables from the safe.
One of the fine pianos which was carried
out and placed' over forty feet from the
ployes worked heroically to save the
building, but the fire apparatus was out
of order and nothing could be done. The
fire locomotive of the Southern Pacific
was sent down from . Dunsmulr, but ar
rived too late to be of any service. "When
it was found that nothing could save the
tavern the manager and employes turned
their attention to assisting the guests in
removing their clothing and other effects
to a place of safety. While thus engaged
in looking after the property' of theÂ»guests
a number of the employes lost nearly all
their own clothing and personal effects.
burning building caught fire from thÂ« in
tense heat and was destroyed.
The tavern was a three-story brick
building and had 250 rooms and was fur
nished In the most elegant and costly
manner. The silver and china service
alone was worth a fortune and none of
these were saved.
It is not known how the fire originated,
as there had been no heat In the wash
house. It is thought, however, that an
electric wire may have started the blaze.
There were about seventy-five guests In
the tavern.
The tavern which was the property of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
was under the management of E. B. Pix
lev and has had an unusually successful
run this year. The guests have scattered
to Various neighboring resorts and a few

REDWOOD CITY. July 20.-The prelimi
nary examination of the suspects in the
Colma murder case held here to-day re
sulted in the defendants being h*ld over
without ball to appear before the Superior
Court to answer for the murder of Eliza
beth Mitchell and David Mitchell.
At the close of the testimony the court
made the following remarks:
The court has noticed during the holding of
these proceedings that a spirit of levity was
manifested by some of the parties connected
with this alleged murder, as 11" the fact of the
taking of a human life v.as a matter of email
moment not to be considered a thlnu worth
while. Now this court has no sympathy what
ever with any persons, be they black or white,
who will deliberately and wiUtully take human
life, and this continuous killing that has
U-en coinc on at Colma must be stopped, and
the court believes that the evidence warrants
the holcine of these defendants.
Mrs. Inisand Takes the Stand.
The most interesting testimony of the
day was that of Mrs. Antonia Imsand.
Attorneys Bullock, Fitzpatrick and Walk
er were several times at loggerheads, the
most exciting moment being when Bullock
asked Mrs. Imsand what the conversation
was that she had held with Leinascher
and Ehlers on July 3, the night before the
killing. Hardly were the words out of
his mouth when Attorney Walker sprang
to his feet and said:
"May it piease the court, Mrs. Imsand
has called upon me as an attorney at law,
to be instructed as to her rights, as a
witness in a criminal or other proceed*
ings; from what she has stated to me it
appears, it has appeared in public print
many times, that she is to be arrested for
complicity in the killing of Mrs. Mitchell
and the boy; I have advosed her, as
an attorney at law, that it is her abso
lute right as a witness t& refuse to testify,
or decline to testify, or answer any ques
tion which might In any ,way tend to
criminate her. or subject her to punish
ment, and that she has an absolute right
to decline to answer any such question;
and I ask the court to so instruct her."
The examination then proceeded as
follows:
The Court â Do you mean. Mr. Walker, that
che will claim her rieht?
Mr. Walkerâ She has a right to so claim, if
6he chooses to do so.
Mr. Bullockâ Mrs. Imsand, what conversa
tion, if any. did you have with Mr. Lemascher
and with Mr. Ehlers on July 3 of. this year at
your house In OVlma In this county?
I decline to ansv.er that.
On what ground?
On the ground that the newspaper reporters
have had too much to say about It.' I'm afraid
it will put me In trouble.
What the reporters may say hasn't anything
to do with it, it cannot injure you.
Mr. Walkerâ The lady is not familiar with
our rules of law and she has manifested by
her laniruac what hÂ»r obJ*?cMon Is. and the
court will consider that.
Mr. Uullock <to the witness)â Mrs. Imsand,
is it upon the ground that if you should answer
this question you are afraid that it might tend
to incriminate you?
Widow Fears Incrimlnation.
I told you that I declined to answer the ques
tion. ,
I want an answer to the question.
The Courtâ She probably means that.
Mr. Uullock <to the witness)â Do you refuse I
to answer that question upon the ground that
it may Incriminate you: that is, may get you 'Â¦
into trouble In connection with this case. Is
that the reason that you refuse?
I don't understand that; I ran only talk a
little Kiieli.'-h. and I don't understand what
you rnean by It.
Tell me why you refuse to answer the ques
tion?
I have told you already.
Tell me ar.-.ln.
For fear that it puts me In trouble.
Now, did you. on the morning of July 3, 1900.
at Colma. In San Mateo County. Cal.. and at
your house In Colma. give to Mr. Frank Le
maschÂ«r a twenty-dollar gold piece with whlca
to purchase two rifles?
I decline to answer.
On the came cround and for the same rea
son?
Tes. *!r.
Did you. Mrs. Imsar.d, on the morning of
July 3, 1901 at your house at Colma, tell Mr.
Frank Iymascher to take twenty dollars and
purchase a, rifle for himself and for Mr. Caesar
Ehlers?
I decline to answer that.
And fcr the tame reason?
|Y*>s. sir. .
This closed the examination of lirs. v Im
sand. Prior to this the widow had re
turned vague a"nd unsatisfactory answers
to all Important questions. When asked
at T.hat time I.emaseher returned to the
hog ranch on the night of July 3 she re
plied. "I don't know." The witness stated
that on the night of July 4 she had slept
on her return from San Francisco with
Mrs. Tassi, as she had been warned by
them not to go near "the 'niR-Ker,' who
â¢was shooting a rifle Instead of firecrack
ers."
" How She Heard First News.
Mrs. Imsand claimed to have first heard
of the shooting from a Mrs. I.areromar
sina's brother-in-law, who knocked on the
â¢window of her bedroom at 1 o'clock on the
morning of the 5th of July.
"What did he say?' 1 asked Bullock.
Fitzpatrick attacked this question and
Bullock withdrew It.
Mitchell was an Interested spectator of
the nrocf-edtnijs. The courtroom was
crowded with people from Colma and the
neighborhood. â¢
Bachtnan, the San' Francisco gunsmith,
and Lemascher, who purchased the rifles
of him the day before the shooting, both
identified the rifies with which the shoot-
Ing- was done and which were offered in
evidence. The sympathy of the town Is
Â¦with the suspects, and their detention Is
causing much adverse comment here.

I did not want to serve under him. Dixon

asked Powers how long this was going on.
He said not much longer, as Goebel would
be killed and that would settle It. That

A Convenience That Business Men
Will Appreciate.
SPECIAL SLEEPER .
FOR BAKERSRELD
The rapid increase of the oil interests In
and about Bakersfield has occasioned
such unusual traffic between that city and
San Francisco that the Espee has found
it necessary to increase the sleeping car
facilities of the "Owl." Arrangements
have been made for that train, leaving
this evening and in future, to carry a
special Bakersfield sleeper, so that the oc
cuuants may be permitted to remain un
disturbed till a comfortable rising hour in
th* morning. a
The convenience of this will be keenly
appreciated by business men, as the arriv
ing time at Bakersficld. either of the
"Owl" or Express, is in the dead of night,
when a fellow doesn't like to be hustled
out.
The plan Is equally convenient from
Bakersfield. "While.the "Owl" doesn't pass
tlil two hours after midnight, passengers
may enter the car at pleasure and get a
full" night's rest.

SCHEPER'S HOUSEHOLD
CONDITIONS ARE AIRED
v Mary A. Manley, an attractive, well
dressed young woman, was arrested last
evening on a warrant sworn to by her
father, who Is Postmaster at Penryn,
charging her with' insanity. She was
taken to the detention ward of th6 Re
ceiving Hospital and locked up in a
padded ceil.
If the unfortunate woman be mentally
deranged the doctors at the hospital have
failed to discover it. She converses in a
rational manner and does not exhibit the
Â¦slightest symptoms of a tottering: mind.
Miss Manley arrived here about six
weeks ago from Penryn and went to work
for the telephone comoany. She soon
erew tired of her employment and re
ei&ned her position. Since then she has
been living at the "Winchester House on
Third street, frequently goins hungry m
order to pay her room rent. Her sad con
dition appealed to a Mrs. Durrell, wno
lives in the house, and she did all In her
power to hrighten the life, of the mis
erable woman.
Yesterday morning: the father of the giil
appeared In the Superior Court and after
stating that his daughter was mentally
Irresponsible swore to a complaint agalnÂ«t
her tor insanity. Policemen Coghlan and
Tracey were sent to the Winchester
House to arrest her. but in deference to
her wishes they allowed Mrs. Durrell to
escort her to the hospital while they
walked on behind them.
After being placed in a cell Miss Man
ley became hysterical and amid tears she
declared that her arrest was part of a
conspiracy engineered by her father to
get her out of the way. To Matron An
drews the woman said that her father
had driven her away from home after
telling her that she would have to sup
port herself. -
This is denied by Manley. lie daim3
that at times the girl is mentally irre
sponsible and that he Intend? to have her
sent to some private asylum in the hopa
that her health will be restored.
Mrs. Durrell." who accompanied the
young woman to the hospital, character
izes h$r arrest as an outrage.
"If her mind were impaired." indignant
ly remarked Mrs. Durrell when discussing
the case. "I would know it, as I have
frequently conversed with since she
has been stopping at the Winchester
House. She always appeared rational and
was the last person in the world that I
would take to be mentally weak. I . am
thoroughly satisfied that she Is perfectly
sane and intend to do all in my power
to have her released from the hospital
to-morrow.'.'

for his dear and honored name. We sha'.l
remember him longest because of the
largest thing which he did for us. and
what that Is ;t is not possible to doubt.
He gave us the music of human freedom,
of human brotherhood, of passionate hu
man purity, of an intimacy with nature
more widely comprehensible than that of
"Wordsworth and scarcely surpassed bv

something beyond all this; he gave U3

There is, in fact, so positive a religious
character to the poetry of Whittier as to
partake of the nature of sacredness and to
call for the reverence due to sacred
things. Some of his poems suggest in
spiration of a quality and a degree not
to be considered on a level with the ex
pression of a less dedicated genius.
A young student of hi3 writings will
bear in mind that for this very reason a
certain claÂ«s of critics will find It possible
to adopt a tone toward the poet and his
art which they would never be tempted
to us? in treating the poetry of a man
equally genuine but less devout.
It used to be the fashion among critics
not in sympathy with the religious nature
and aims of the Quaker poet to recognize
him reluctantly. His stately fame came
to him slowly. But it came rlrmly. It be

a number of their San Francisco
"cousins" who are banded together under
the dignified title, "The Shew Hing Be
nevolent Association," are getting evi
dence together by which they hope to col
lect J2Q.O0O damages from ex-Chief of
Police Lees aJid Sergeant Thomas S.
Duke.
Some of Lees' men under the leadership
of Sergeant Duke became convinced on
the night of October 6. 1*99, that the rat
tle of dominoes told the story that the
Ehew.Hing Association hod temporarily
rented from its benevolent labors and was
engaged In seeking needed relaxation in
little games' of "'pi gow" and "tan."
Duke"s ax distributed the splinters of the
association door in the midst of the in
terested Cantonese and the duty of in
definitely postponing the g-aine was soon
completed.
Incensed at the uninvited intrusion, the
Ehtw Hing Benevolent Association filed
suit yesterday to recover $20,</>0 damages
from Lees and Duke. As cause of action
thÂ» plaintiff corporation sets â¢ forth the
facts stated and, following the allegation
that Duke's visit rendered the associa
tion rooms untenable for some time, the
plaintiff maices its demand for remunera
tive and exemplary damages In the sum
named.
The case will be watched with Interest,
not alone by the Chinese, but by the
police. If these associations are exempt
from the law prohibiting the playing of
pi gow and fan tan, the police will find

Two Jurors Out of a Venire of Forty
Passed in Conlan's
Court.
A start was made in the trial of the
poolroom cases yesterday afternoon In
Judge Conlan's court. A venire of forty
had been issued Thursday In the case of
Joe Peckerman of Zick Abrams' rooms
and at 2 o'clock the case was called. At
torney Coffey appeared as special prose
cutor and Attorney George Collins repre
sented the defendant.
Some of those summoned were under
or over age and others were excused for
various reasons. Out of the first twelve
only two had been accepted, and the
Judge ordered them to stand up to be
sworn, asking Collins if he had any chal
lenge to make. Colliris said he would re
serve his right to challenge till the twelve
had been passed upon, but the Judge
warned him that he had better use his
right then, but he still declined, and the
jurors were sworn. Shortly afterward one
of the other veniremen said he believed
the ordinance against poolselling was a
good one. and Collins at once challenged
him to the amu^ment of the spectators
in court. )
The two jurors accepted were John
Whiting, stove packer, 14 Second street,
and James Fortune, grocery clerk. 732
Green street. The case was continued till
July 24, and another venire of forty was
issued.

searchlight on the bridge followed the boat
in all its wanderings. Not a trace of Sul
livan could be found, and once more the
Hancock had to stand on her course.
On June 27 Private Gas Morse took It
Into his head to jump overboard, and then
was seen as smart a piece of seamanship
as has been recorded In manv a day. At
2:09 p. m. the signal was given t'o the
bridge and a second later the engines were
reversed. The Hancock was going through
the water at the rate of seventeen knots
an hour, yet at 2:11 p. m. a boat was in
the water, manned and on the way to the
rescue. At 2:1S p. m. Morse was picked up
and secured In the bottom of the boat and
at 2:25 p. m. the cutter was back in the
davits and the Hancock was once more
going full speed ahead. This Is a per
formance that the officers and crew of the
Hancock have every reason to be proud
of.
On June 19 both wind and weather were
against a rescue. On June 22 the darknes-s
prevented the rescue of a man determined
to die, but on June 27 both officers and
men could see what they were doing and
the would-be suicide was rescued. The
Hancock will dock at Folsom street wharf
on Sunday and will sail for Manila this
day week.
work of getting the transport
I Hancock cway for China is going on
[ day and night. Strange to say. the
Chinese who form her crew are the
most eager of all aboard to hurry up the
sailing day. They are anxious to get the
American troops to Taku p.? quickly as
possible in order that the Boxers may re
ceive a lesson and peace and order be re
stored in China. It seems an anomaly to
eee a Chinese crew on an American trans
port that is to sail July 2S with soldiers
who may have to wage a bitter war
against the Chinese surrounding Peking.
But such is the case, and firemen, coal
passers ar.d bailors on the Hancock are
doing everything in their power to expe
dite the sailing of the vessel.
The officers of the Hancock have noth
ing but good words to say about their
Mongolian crew. The Chinese are obe
dient, sober and hard-working, and to be
depended upon in an emergency.
Cm June 1*. when the transport was only
a short time out of Manila; Private J.
Gavin jumped overboard. It Â¦was raining
hard and a heavy squall brought all hands
on deck. It was 6 o'clock In the evening
and so thick that an object 200 yards away
could not be seen from the bridge. A boat
was lowered, and although it was In con
stant danger of being swamped the crew
of live made a diligent search for the
missing man, but no trace of him could be
found.
Three days after this episode Private
Joseph Sullivan Jumped overboard. This
was at 10 o'clock on the night of the 22d,
when it was pitch dark. There was not a
star in the sky and the moon had not
risen. As soori as the cry "A man over
board!" was raised a "flare" buoy was
dropped from amidships by order of Cap
tain Harry Struve. This kind of a buoy
is so constructed that when it reaches the
water it rights itself and the impact with
the water ignites two flares that are fixed
to the buoy. These throw a glare for a
great distance, and not only enable tha
drowning man to see where he can reach
a support, but also guide the boat that is
out on the search.
A few minutes after the flare buoy was
thrown over it was nearly a mile astern,
but In that time a boat had been lowered
and was belnÂ»ar rowed back to the scene.
For thirty-four minutes the men of the
Hancock kept up the hunt, while the

The Pacific Mall Company's Walla Wal
la was to have got away at 11 a. m. for
Pugei Sound yesterday, but was delayed
through the blowing out of a manhole
gasket. She had only just got away from
â¢the wharf when the accident happened,
and no time was lost In getting her back
to the dock. The passengers a n remained
aboard and were v/t-H cared for by the com
pany. The steamer was to have sailed
again at 5 p. m., but it was early this
morning before she finally got away.
The steamer W. H. Kruger put in here
yesterday morning to land the crew of the
steamer I^aguna. In the latter part of
April the Laguna went ashore on the spit
at the entrance to Tillamook. Later she
was got off. and although waterlogged it
was decided to tow her to San Francisco
for assistance. Captain Genereaux and a
couple of men were in charge of the
waterlogged craft, and on July 15 the Kru
ger took her in tow and a start was made.
Two days later a northwester sprang up
and the men on the Laguna were taken
off. That night the hawser parted and
the Laguna wag lost in the thick fog. This
was ten miles southwest of Crescent City,
and the Laguna is now floating around

Improved crop conditions furnish the keynote
of the trade and price movement. As a result
of them, nearly all staple agricultural products
are lower In price and at the same time a
perceptible livening up of demand for fall de
livery Is noted at the West, Northwest and
South. The beginning of fall trade â¢ is conse
quently more clearly visible In the sections
mentioned, while at the East the markets are
slow to experience this Improvement and are
consequently seasonably dull. Bank clearings
as yet fall to reflect any* perceptible Improve
ment In distribution, and railway earnings,
though of large volume, are, owing to compari
sons being made with exceptionally good re
sults last year, showing less notable Increases
both In ctops and net returns. An Increased
cost of repairs, betterments, fuel and wages
are unitedly responsible for this latter feature,
because gross receipts for later periods reported
show continued, though small, gains.
Hog products have gone lower with corn,
as has also wheat, in which continued liquida
tion'has been noted, with the result of induc
ing partial return of the export Inquiry ban
ished from the market by the recent heavy
rise. On the basis of a crop of {Â£0,000,000 bu.Â»h

poor appreciation of the advance here yester
day and her receipts for three days, 872.000

Following the opening dip, however, a reac
tion set In. The Chronicle estimating the Cal

tons to 550,000 tons, or 18.430,000 bushels, com
pared with 83,000,000 bushels a year ago. The
estimate was rather startling. The talent had
been paying more attention to other points and
the announcement sent shorts to cover. Later
in the day gloomy reports from North Dakota

advance. The market during the forenoon

NEW" TORK. July 20. â Bradstreet' s review of
the New York etock market to-day will say:
The stock market has been strong In the face
of dullness and of the Chinese situation and
other adverse factors of external origin. The
renewal of gold exports and the appearance
of hardening tendencies In money caused, how
ever. Bomewhat a weaker tone to prevail in the
last few days and the market seemed more
disposed to pay attention to the grave Interna
tional complications which may result from
the trouble in' China.
The reactions which were occurring In Rus
sian and other governmental securities, as well
as those of China, have again unsettled the
foreign markets and led to London being a
heavy seller of stocks here. The advance In
the Bank of England rate from 3 to 4 per cent
on Thursday and the shipment of $2,000,000 gold
from New Tork to Paris points to the tact
that Kurope is preparing for financial pressure
and will use all efforts to attract gold from
this country. Our market Is certainly Inclined
to regard the gold exportatlons without fear,
particularly In view of the large Influx of the
metal from Alaska and the news of heavy
specie- shipments lh progress or In prospect
from Australia to Ban Francisco. It Is recog
nized that American money Is relatively too
low and that higher Interest will be but the
proper protection against European demands,
although with the abundance of capital In the
country there Is no apprehension on the part
of Wall street regarding any serious disturb
ance of money rates, even If European borrow
ings here should assume much greater propor
tions. The news from Peking on Friday an
nouncing the safety of the American and other
Ministers, had a favorable effect on the market
at large and caused advances throughout the
list, with a strong tone at the close.

Harrison's circular says: "During the weÂ»k
there have been three arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 71C0 tons; thr#e from British
Columbia." 12.7^ tons: one from Australia. 2yJi
tons; total. 22.97S tons. There were five deliv
eries here of Australian last week, amounting
to 13,735 tons; this has not happened for several
years; they went directly to consumers, as tha
ccal was badly needed. Seldom before In tha
history of the trad* have the yards looked aa
they do now with such slim stocks on har.d;
and the cutlock Is most discouraging as to fu
ture supplies. In former years we recjlved
from Australia and Great Britain an average
of 30.000 tons monthly, whereas this year W9
shall not receive to exceed 10.C-00 tons: the defi
cit has to be made trood by increased shipments
from the coast collieries and crude oil. Our
fuel consumption Increases annually, and our
sources of supply are becoming more prescribed.
Our position to-day- would be a most serious
one If oil had not come to our rescue. At last
our colliery proprietors are availing themselves
of the present depleted condition of our yards,
and have marked up prices. There Is a limit
to the advance on domestic coal, as housekeep
ers w'.H drop Its use an.l consume gas for econ
omy. Australia will cease to become one of
our sources of supply If the Chinese war be
comes general, as the war ships centered there
will draw their fuel supply from the colonies."

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, July 20.â R. G: Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The midsummer vacation bas already disposed
of the prophets who gave It a "week or two,"
but there are few signs to Indicate its prob
able duration. The compact of lake ore pro
ducers, in order to . sell standard Bessemer
ore below $5 50 at lower lake ports this year
with coke held at $2 DO, much lessens the prob
ability that the market will wait for Bessemer
pig to mo far below $15. and some Â¦ increased
buying has already appeared by makers of Im
plements, not as yet In season contracts, but
enough to give hope. Not much beyond wait
ing Is probable until wages for the coming
year can be settled. The same extensive build-
Ing strikes which have cut off the use of much
structural steel have prevented a vast use or
lumber, which was, like Iron, extraordinarily
advanced in prices. The Eastern association
tried without avail to hold prices a.nd the
North Carolina Association caused extensive
curtailment of output, while the Lake Asso
ciation two weeks ago resolved to maintain
prices, but the needed market does not yet
appear.
When cotton had been easily held above 10
cents and then had dropped sharply a Liver
pool speculator again showed howeaslly Amer
icans are induced to accept higher prices for
the quantity they have left for sale. The dry
goods market, quite embarrassed at the best,
is not helped by such vagaries and the closing
of Important mills was the more meritorious
because it gave occasion at the end of a sea
son, with an oversupply here both of goods
and material, to rest until Europeans have
settled their affairs. Without formal agree
ment the woolen industry adopted in part thj
same course, many mills having stopped or
reduced force so that experts believe that less
than half the capacity is now at work because
the nature of the next season's demand does
not yet appear. There has resulted more will
ingness to sell wool, especially where ware
houses are not plenty and prices average fully
2 cents lower than In February, but manu
facturers are inquiring more earnestly Just
now to find out what Roods they can sell rather
than where they can^jet materials.
Further Important changes, the exact nature
of which may not be fully reported, are ap
pearing in the heavy decline of packer hides
at Chicago, ranginar from a quarter to half R.
cent.' with sales said to be from 40,000 to oO.OOO,
and also In heavy sales of leather to manu
facturers. â j
The sharp fall of 2 cents In wheat and 4
cents in corn appears to reflect public con
clusions, after hearing much evidence, official
and unofficial, regarding the extent of injury
to both grains. The shipments go on at a
quiet and moderate pace, in three weeks from
Atlantic ports S.661.501 bushels wheat, flour
included, against 6,f>05.393 bushels last year:
from Pacific ports, 1.691.597 bushels, against
1,278,648 bushels last year, and In corn, 9,6.0,obS
bushels, against 9.2S9.999 bushels last year
Failures for the week have been 231 in the
United States, against 145 lost year, and it
In Canada, ngainst 23 last -year.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS
CLOSING
Minister Conger had been heard from on July
ih. American securities were the chief bene
nclariee of the better feeling engendered by the
news. Bills wer<\ steady and quieter than yes
terday. The bank bought Â£3S.0O0 in gold bars
and lost Â£7000 to South America.

checked export trade in brown cottons and a
summer shutdown of mills producing these
goods and print ! cloths is looked for.
The crop is emerging from the "grass" In
good condition. An encouraging feature is the
rather better Inquiry for raw Wool at Boston,
but manufacturers will not apparently do much
until the lightweight season opens. Advices
from the London sales are that the market has
regained most of the loss shown earlier In the
eeason.

Cannot Monopolize the Eiver.
A decision of great interest to the people
cf Fresno and Kings counties was ren
dered yesterday by the Supreme Court.
F<>r rr.any years a number of Irrigation
companies ha\ - * drawn their supply of
â¢water frotn the Kinjrs River in Kings
County, each taking i-ufficient for Its pur
p< *-e and leaving enoujh for Its neighbors
farther down. In 1S?4 the Emigrant Ditch
Company opened a canal and put in a di
vfr;::.p dam in Fresno County and with
drew the bulk of the water from Kings
Ii:ver. This was productive of a number
of actions to restrain the up-river com
pany from diverting- the water from its
r-.aturai flow. These actions were brought
by the Last Chance Water Ditch Com
pany, the people's Ditch Company and
the Lomer Kings River Water Ditch Com
pany. In the lower court Judgment Â¦went
;:Â¦- Â¦..-.â¢". the Emisrrant Ditch Company and
the latter appealed to the Supreme Court,
vhich. has affirmed the Judgment In each
case.

OIL PRODUCERS OF
KERN TO ORGANIZE
Special Di.Â«patch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. July 20.â Oil producers
of Kern County are moving to look out
for number one. Representatives of all
the leading producing companies of this
county met in a mass-meetin? this after
noon and started the ball rolling with a
view to forming an organization to handle
and control the marketing of their' pro
duct.
The time is drawing near when the opt
put of this county will cut a big- figure
In the petroleum market. Before this
event arrives it Is proposed to pet ready
to provide against Its calamitous fluctua
tion, which oil men think will follow if
Individuals are permitted to throw their
product on the market at will. Hence the
meeting.
A committee consisting of C. A. Can
field. J. M. Keith. W. G. Kerehoff. W. E.
Knowies. H. A. Blodget. E. L. Doheney,
W. H. McKenzIe. Bert Green. B. F.
Brooks. O. Scribner. H. H. Blood and
Dave Ewlng was appointed to formulate
a plan of organization and report back at
some future meeting. Much Interest was
displayed and the meeting was largely at
tended. It Is proposed to make the or
ganization a business one. possibly a stock
company with lots of coin behind itâsuf
ficient to completely handle the entire oil
product of Kern County, which it is pre
dicted will be 50.000 barrels a day before
many seasons. Large- tankage facilities
and pipelines will be established in all
districts, and also tankage at markets,
where consumers can come and purchase
direct from the association. When an indi
vidual wants to sell he will turn his oil
into a tank and get a certificate for It.
which will be as good as coin. The mar
ket will be kept supplied as consumption
demands, and r.o more. In this way oil
men feel sure the market can be kept up
all right. An effort will also be made to
cultivate a demand for petroleum, which
some oil men think can be made reach
100,000 barrels a day in California.

BLUE AND THE GRAY NOT
ABSOLUTELY RECONCILED
General Gordon Takes Exception to
Some Portions of General
Shaw's Speech.
ATLANTA. Ga.. July 20.â John B. Oor
don. commander-In-chief of the United
Confederate Veterans, disobeying his
physicians' orders, was present with the
ether distinguished veterans and Gray
Veterans at the barbecue this afternoon,
end sat by the side of General Albert D.
Shaw, commander-ln-chlef of the Grand
Army of the Republic. All the Invited
guests made speeches, but the second on
the programme, that of General Shaw,
did not please General Gordon, and for a
time reconciliation was forgotten. General
Shaw's speech was for the most part
conciliatory in tone and was well re
ceived, yet his reference to the manner
in which ail memories of the great strug
gle should be blotted out In the families
of the South was not received with favor.
In his speech he uttered these words, and
they went deeply Into General Gordon's
"The keeping alive of sectional teach
ings as to the Justice and rights of the
cause of the South In the hearts of the
children is all out of order, unwise, un
just and utterly opposed to the bond by
which the great chieftain. Lee. solemnly
bound the cause of the South In his final
surrender." . â .
At the close of General fehaw s speech
General Gordon came forward. He had
spoken briefly before and his appearance
again caused considerable surprise. The
enthusiasm quieted Instantly. General
Gordon said he could not teach his chil
dren that he fought for what was wrong.
He entered battle for what he believed
was right, and. said he, "Only the Judg
ment day and God himself will ever de
cide who was right." **' . ,:
General Shaw responded gracefully to
the general's exception. He stated that
he had prepared his speech with care and
much of the material therein was gather
ed from speeches made by General Gor
don In the North.
"Our children should be taught," paid
General Shaw, "the true glory and sub
limity of our one country; their fathers
will teach them this. Let them be so
alike, the children of the North and of
the South, that no difference will be per
ceptible."
The Incident closed with three cheers
for the Blue and . the Gray.

George Hayden, two years old, son of
Mr. and Mrs. William Hayden. residing at
5*6 Caledonia avenue, was attacked by a
pet raccoon at the house to-day, and ter
ribly bitten about the head and face be
fore the uply animal was b*atÂ«*n off by
clubbing. The baby was rescued by the
mother, who heard the child's screams
and, arming herself with a heavy stick,
fought the raccoon off and dragged the
little boy out of reach.
The raccoon was killed by the child's
father as soon as he arrived home and
learned of the narrow escape of the baby
from death.
Th<* Haydena had been taking care of
the residence- during the absence of the
Gregorys, whose home it is. The raccoon
was owned by ClydÂ«* Gregory. For a lon^
time the animal had been a pet and it
was supposed was harmless ami domesti
cated. It was kept chained near a ken
nel in the back yen!. Mr. Hayden had.
however, been careful to keep the chil-i
away from the animal, but this afternoon
while the little one wap toddBner about the
yard he tot too near tho raccoon. With
out warning- the creature sprang upon the
baby, knocking him clown, scratching and
tiling with ugly ferocity. The sharp teeth
and claws w<=r<Â» buried in the infant's ten
dor fl>Â«h. tearir.g and gouging with all the
m'ar.rc" of a v.-'ld animal's attack. The
baby lay helpless and screaming from
fright and pain when the mother rushed
to save her little one from the angered
ThÂ«Â» bal>y"s= head was badly torn and tile
ears and scalp were seriously lacerated.
Medical treatment was speedily at hand,
but the severe shock has left the child in
a. dangerous condition.

1113 Broadway, Julr 2u-
The first train over the little Califor
nia and Nevada Railroad made a round
trip to-day and brought a load of hay out
of the fertile but neglected San Pablo
Valley.
This fact is Tf interest mainly as being
one of the moves that are being made on
this little road. *il of which :nerely con
firm the stor. published in The Call of
some weeks ago that the California and
Nevada Rail/oad had passed Into the
hands of the Santa Fe system, and It
v.*as only a question of time when the
great railroad system chose to absorb the
smaller road and utilize it for an entrance
Into On and.
From the movf that are being made on
the California and Nevada system It Is
becoming more and more evident that e
absorption will take place the moment
that the litigation now pending over the
bonds ts settled.
The reopening of the road is bein. con
ducted by Santa Fe Railroad officials.
First of all A. A. Grant, who built large
sections of the Valley road and near./
all of the Santa >'e lines in Southern Cal
ifornia, is the receiver of the road. A. S.
Stuart, who has been connected with the
Santa Fe system for years, has been ap
p:ln;ei superintend. nt of the r Â»i and
is directing the reconstruction 1 1 me line.
The other employes of the little road,
while few In number, have been drawn
from the Santa Fe at Point Richmond.
The roacoed of the little line Is being
repaired, brldgres ~.aeed and a consider
able amount of wor.c done thereon. Tnls
work would not be lost were the :oad to
be reconstructed this winter. Though the
new management of the road declines to
discuss the future, the indications â¢
that the road will be operated during 1 the
summer, hauling produce out of the San
Pablo Canyon, and that the conversion of
the road Into a broadgauge will take place
this winter when the litigation is finally
settled.
The recent decision of Judge Heacock,
Commissioner of the United States < ir
cult Court, that the F. M. Smith bonds
against the road were illegally issued, and
that ti - Captain J. W. Sirlth bonds, row
held by ciarles H. Smith and A. A.
Grant, were thÂ« only legal lien against
the road, but that these bonds belonged
to the estate of Car tain J. '.V. Smith, has
done much to clear the title 9t the road.
The only struggle now on Is to pet the
bonds out of the estate of Captain J. W.
Smith.

BEF.KKI.EV. July 20. âBenjamin Ide
Wbeeler. president of the University of
California; returned to-day from his East
ern 'rip. He has been looking for new
3-atÂ»na! for the university faculty and
wctO recommend Â« l!st c* names to the R<>-
F- Dti at their t:Â«Â»xt meeting. He declines,
however, to. give out the natnes of those
candidates or the positions they will fill.
Ftatfng. however, that they are micor po-
Eitions.
"I have no plans for the future." sa!d
President Wheeler, "except what I hai
before I vent away. My trip was tak-n
witb the view of looking over the field fcr
rr< r. whom we cannot find among our own
praduates to rake positions of instructors
fe:.i assistants. There will be no new
jiaces created in the faculty."
President Wheeler left here about the
middle of last month, jroinff directly to
Chicago. Â» lime he called upon several can
ci tetÂ«c for positions in Berkeley. Fr^m
there he wrr.t to Providence. R. I., and
attended the rjpper given at the twenty
fifth anniversary of the graduation of his
Â«~la?F. He received from his alma matÂ»r
e* Hr<:wn the honorary dejrree of LI*. D.
The same degree was conferred on him at
Harvard.
1 r. \V)vf*;er visited Salem. New Hamp
f~:re. th<Â» orijrina! home of his family;
Harvard University. New Tork City, Al
bas?; Cazenorla and Chautauqua. At the
JÂ»ft named place he remained two days,
j. â¢â¢r;r a lecture on "Greek Religion."
From ChautAUQca he returned to Al-
I ujjt. whore be met Mrs. Wheeler. The
n -v was then made to Chicago and
:: m tnert to Berkeley.
Pr. Wheeler :< particularly well pleased
Ti.-h rhÂ« view Eartern people have of the
1'aiieifelty of California. "We arf kr.o-wn
a~>i appreciated." ho said. "The people
; - c Interested in California and I have
:r t many Etudests who wish to come here.
â¢ rtudy. We would have no difficulty in
- tttss p"oÂ«l Eastern men in our faculty
i.- California is now r*=c<igr.iaf-d as one of
:: Â¦ foremost uriversities in the country."
Pr^sid^nt Wheeler wishes to create a
f.- j-.p.r'rs^r.r of irrigation. proviÂ£ir<Â« the
5 incea of the university will warrant It.
}â¢"â¢ :r3"':cs Is not taught here, and Presi
dent Wheeler, who has beer, looking up
;V subject while East, will interest the
r- gents ir. it. "We ar<:- making 3v<> cents
iio what a dollar should do." said Dr.
Wheeler in speaking of th* finances. "I
rn giad to state, however, that we closed
this year without a def.cit as against a
342.000 deficit last yea-."
President Wheeler savs that the political
r::ua:ion in the East is unusually quiet.
*Â«einÂ»r overshadowed by the trouble In
China.
IÂ»o New Placfs Are Created in the
Faculty and the Positions
to Be Filled Are

An Illegal Contingent Fee.
Some time ago Mrs. Ada M. Freltas de
cided to apply for a divorce from her hus
band, Manuel T. Frietas. * She entered
into a contract with Attorney J. II.- Long
by which he was to receive one-third of
all tho -community property awarded to
her. The case was carried to the Supreme
Court and as Mr. Long had no license to
practice before that tribunal he had to
secure the services of Delmas & Short
ridgre to attend to the matter. The Supe
rior-Court pronounced the contract be
tween the attorney and the divorcee il
legal, but as Long had performed valuable
services In the lower court for his client
he was allowed $1100 as a fee. After the
settlement of the case Long assigned' the
contingent, fee contract to Samuel New
man, who sued Mrs. Freitas. In the lower
court he lost his suit and this decision
was affirmed yesterday by the Supremo
Court.

There has been no love lost for some
years between Judge Conlan and Frank
JCane, secretary of the Pacific Coast Soci
ety for the Suppression of Vice. Yester
day morning the Judge took occasion to
express in open court his opinion of Kane
In language that could not be misunder
stood. Â¦ >'',â¢*:
It all arose out of the case of Masuji
Miyakawa. the Japanese charged with ex
torting money from Japanese saloon-keep
ers and proprietors of disreputable houses.
He had been ordered into custody by
Judge Fritz till he furnished bonds for
f2000. Judge Fritz having left on his vaca
tion Miyakawa with his bondsmen ap
peared before Judge â¢ Conlan yesterday.
Ex-Judge Graham, representing.Miyaka
wa, asked that the bonds should be re
duced to 5500.
Chief Sullivan was In court and the
Judge, addressing him, said:
"\ou have the wrong man In custody on
this charge. The right man Is that unmiti
gated blackmailing' scoundrel, Frank
Kane, who should be in the State's prison
along with his predecessor. I am satis
fied this Japanese was merely a tool of
that rascal to collect backsheesh from
Japanese saloon men and keepers of dives.
If .this man Miyakawa. would, tell the
truth you would flnd that I am right."
"Will you issue a warrant for Kane's ar
rest?" ask<>d Graham.
"Yes, I will, if you will write It out."
replied the Judge. "It ia time his star
was taken from him as ho uses It simply
to blackmail people." Â¦' â¢Â¦.
"1 am anxious for the truth." said Chief
Sullivan, "cjtul if Kane has been using this
Japanese as a tool I Fhall soon take his
star from him."
Miyakawa was ordered into custody by
the Judge, but later was released on 52OW
bonds accepted bv the bond clerk. On
learning this the Judge instructed ex-
Judge Graham to bring Miyakawa into
court this morning along with his bonds
men as h* desired to question them as to
their qualifications.
"I would advise you meantime," said the
Judge, "to make an effort to elicit the
truth from your client, and If you are
successful the warrant for Kane's arrest
can be issued."
During tho hearing before Judge Fritz
a letter compromising Kane was read, but
Kane denied its authenticity
Accused of Being an Un
mitigated Blackmailing
Scoundrel.
FRANK KANE IS
EXCORIATED By
JUDGE CONLAN
Representatives of the. Market-street
Railway Company admitted to the mem
bers of the Board of Public Works yes
terday at a conference that they had
acted without authority in stringing elec
tric wires and running cars on Bush
street, between Kearny and Sansome.
They expressed ability to show that they
had rights on Battery and First streets,
but made a i.lay for time, and the hear
ing was postponed in order that they
might prepare their case. In the mean
time Acting Mayor Tobin, not to be
caugWt napping, has repeated his orders
to the police not to permit employes of
the company to erect any poles on First
or Battery street**.
Attorney J. E. Foulds appeared on be
half of the railroad company. He was
supported by H. H. Lynch, superintendent
of construction of the Market-street Com
pany. Coionel Mendall. president of the
Board of Works, and Commissioners
Manson and Magulre were present, and
were advised by Attorney John B. Gart
land of the Street Department. Â¦
Attorney Foulds stated blandly that
while it was admitted tb,at the company
had proceeded without authority Jn
stretching wires on Bush 'Street, the ne
cessity of such action seemed necessary
at the time, and would be fully justified
later. The company would, at an early
date, he said, petition the Board of Su
pervisors for the necessary permission
to operate cars on Bush street, and did
not expect to meet with any opposition.
Attorney Gartland made the point that
the Market-street Railway Company, un
der the charter provisions had lost all of
Its rights on Sansome and First streets
b/ failing to run cars on the tracks there
during a i eriod of over six months. For
many months the one bobtailed horsecar
on First strt-et was discontinued, but dur
ing the past two weeks it made the trip
daily over the line. Mr. Gartland deemed
that the company had forfeited all rights.
The railroad people asked for time in
which to supply data to show that they
had a iepal right to erect wires and ope
rate cars on Sansome and First streets.
The time was granted.
Mean while the Board of Works will
keep an eye on the shifty construction
methods? of the Market-street Company
to see that no. further street grabbing
goes forward.
Valentine Trainor Is Charged With
Stealing Jewelry From Mrs.
Maggie McCarthy.
Valentine Trainor, an actor lately with
the Daly stock company, appeared in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday to an-
swer to a charge of petty larceny pre
ferred by Mrs. Maggie McCarthy, 33 Fifth
street. She accused him of stealing a
pair of diamond earrings and a diamond
ring valued at $40. When the case Â¦was
called Mrs. McCarthy refused to testify
ag&inst Trainor. '
She confessed that Trainor had sent her
a letter from the City Prison that hÂ«
would live again with her if she would
get him out. She acknowledged she was
a married woman and her husband would
not return to the city for at least two
months.
Trainor told the Judge he wanted his
character cleared of any imputation
of wrongdoing. The woman had given
him the jewelry to pawn, and because he
had gone to live with Gertrude Wood, an
actress, she had him arrested.
The Judge said he was amused at the
defendant's understanding of a- man of
good character.
"You live with a married woman," said
the Judge, "and you leave her to live
with another woman. I think you are a
man of very bad character."
He continued the case till to-day.

Bubonic Doctors Decide to Enlighten
the Man Who Demanded Their
Resignations.
The Board of Health In regular session
last night refused to listen to the reading
of Supervisor McCarthy's reply to thefr
demand for an explanation of. his attack
upon them in the Board of Supervisors.
Somebody suggested that as It had already
been printed in the papers e\"ery one was
familiar with it. and so It came about that
the communication was merely read by
title.
Dr. Bazet suggested, by way of reply,
that a challenge be issued to Supervisor
McCarthy in this manner: That the pres
idents of the two great universities in this
State be authorized to appoint world
famed bacteriologists who should bo
brought here to act as referees. To them
the proofs of p!ague should be submitted
and by their decision the matter should
be finally settled. If they should support
the Board of Health's opinions then Su
pervisor McCarthy should pay all ex
penses; if against the board, the Individual
members of the board should pay every
thing.
Chief of Police Sullivan suggested that
the entire matter be dropped, as It was
thus giving too much importance to Su
pervisor McCarthy's statements, and the
Board of Supervisors as a body had al
ready backed up the Board of Health Dr.
McCarthy wanted the Supervisors advised
that they might Indict the members of the
Health Board if they saw fit to do so.
President Williamson took still another
view. He thought that the Supervisor
might have erred through misinformation,
and that he ought to be advised as to the
true facts.
Dr. Buckley moved that "Supervisor Mc-
Carthy be enlightened, if possible." and
the motion was carried. The chair said
that he would not appoint a committee,
but that the individual members might
do as much missionary work as they saw
fit. -
The board decided to discontinue the
Chinatown Morgue through lack of funds.

were found in Calnan's barn as having

McMillan Loses a Diamond.
J. A. McMillan, the owner of one of
the horses Policeman Timothy Calnan Is
charged with stealing, was robbed of a
plaint.
Yesterday afternoon one of the other
horses in the stable at Calnan's home
was identified as having been stolen from
George H. Bayley's sale vards, 1623 Mar
ket street, which was also on Calnan's
beat, during the night of June 14. He will
also be booked on the charge of stealing
this horse. The third horse is supposed
to be his own. as he has had it for over
a year, but the detectives are Inquiring
about It.
Calnan joined the force December 4. 1S93.
He was at that time a plasterer. Septem

told him he had that morning purchased
a splendid saddle hor^e from a man named
James Collins of Nevada for $30, a great
bargain. McMillan was shown the horse
and he at once recognized it as the one
stolen from his stabies April 21. showing
Stewart a brand to confirm his statement.
Stewart and McMillan hunted up Maher,
the expressman, ard be told them where
he had taken the cart and harness and
they called at 901 Sanchez street. Calnan
was on hi? beat and they went to see him.
Stewart asked him to return the $30 and
nothing would be said about the stealing
of the horse, but he waxed indignant and
denied having seen Stewart before. Al
though his whiskers were off and his hair
cut Stewart reeognizf-d him at once and
as he could get no satisfaction from him
he went to police headquarters. Calnan
was asked to call and made his appear
ance about 10 o'clock at night. He again
denied flatly to Chief Sullivan and Captain
Seymour that ho was the man who sold
th*- horse, but he was locked up in the
tanks.
Detectives T. B. Gibson and R. F. Gra
ham were detailed on the case and they
learned enough from Mrs. Calnan and
Louis Berperot. landlord of the house
where the Calnans live, to satisfy them,
that they had the right man. Bergerot
told them that up to Thursday morning
Calnan had three horses, but that day he
had told him he had sold one for $30 or
$35. He said he had bought two at auction
and had one at pasture In San Mateo
County. He saw the expressman bring
the cart home.
Yesterday morning George. F. Lyon
treasurer, and J. S. Graham, secretary or.
the Standard MJlk Company, called at the
prison and positively identified Calnan as
the man who as James Collins got the
check for $30 for the horse. To confirm
their identification, cards of the company
which had been given Collins were found

A CLEVER TRICK
David B. Henderson, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, accompanied
by his wife, son and daughter, arrived In
San Francisco yesterday and is registered
at the Palace. The party also included
United States Judge Smith McPherson of
Iowa and his wife. In the afternoon the
Speaker, and his party were driven
through the Park to the CliflJ, Sutro
Heights, the Presidio and other points of
Interest. The leader of the Republican
forces in^the Lower House of Congress
was the guest of John. D. Spreckels at the
Pacific Union Club in the evening, where
dinner was partaken of. Congressman
Metcalf and ex- United States Senator
Charles N. Kelton were also at the ban
quet board.
Mr. Henderson is here on a pleasure
trip and will visit the Yosemite Valley
prior to his departure for the southern
part of the State, where his wife's rela T
lives reside. The Speaker has very pro
nounced ideas as to the duties of Repub
licans and good citizens generally In the
current campaign.
"Providence 4n Its wisdom," said he.
"has thrown open the Orient to the world,
and it Is also provided that California
shall be the natural gateway to the trafllc
of that mighty empire. This Is a chosen
spot If there Is one on the globe, and
if its voters are true to themselves and
the commonwealth they will send to Con
gress a solid delegation of seven Repub
licans. DeVries, a Democrat, was elected
in a Republican district because he ' ad
vocated Republican tariff principles. He
has been appointed by this administration
to a splendid life position and Is out of
the running. Put up some good man In
his district and the Democrats will help
to elect him.
"It is California's bounden duty to come
In solid this year, because 'there Is ,\o
State that will receive so much benefit as
this. The Republican party has fulfilled
every promise i it has made and is the
party of progress and good times. Presi
dent" McKinley Is a typical representative
of that party and has the confidence ot
the nation. Roosevelt is the typical youn?
American, full of the spirit of sturdy
young Americanism, well /supplied with
brains and admired of the general public
from Maine to California. The combina
tion is a great one and the. party is
thoroughly enthused and going forth to
victory. . .. . '
Â¦ "On the other hand comes William J.
Bryan, with his rotten, old thrashed-over
straw, sixteen to one, and asks the voters
of the United States to make their bed
In it. But they will not do so. They have
found that the solid gold standard given
to the country by the Republican pariy
is the foundation of genuine prosperity
and they will leave Mr. Bryan in the rear
of the procession to sing his old song that
makes a majority of the people of this
country weary.
"As to the work of the next Congress
I can say nothing In advance, as It would
be presumptive; but I will declare that
its labors will be for the honor and good
of the American people. President Mc-
Kinley will be in the chair to guard the
country's interests and David B. Hender
son will be doing his best to assist him
as Speaker of the House." .
â¢ 'This morning at 9:30 o'clock Speaker
Henderson will be the guest of Congress

cursion to Mount Tamalpals. The party
will number about twenty-five and will

P3LJCEMAN Timothy C. Calnan of
the Mission district is locked up in
th<- city prison on a charge of
1^-iriR a horsethiof and although
i*- strenuously proclaims his innocence the
evidence is all against him. The worst
feature of the oaÂ«e 1? that the stables
from which the animals were stolen were
on his beat.
Calnan left on his vacation about two
weeks ago and returned last Tuesday
bringing a horse with him which he had
out at pasture near Holy Cross cemetery
fince last April. There is a stable In the
rear of the house where Calnan lived with
his wife at SiOl Sanchez street and the
horse was put in the stable, Â¦where two
other horses owned by the policeman Â¦were
aiso kept. Thursday morning Calnan put
on his camping clothes, consisting of
trown overalls, blue shirt, dark sack coat
and pair of heavy storey shoes, and hitch
ing up the horse be h.td brought with him
from the country drove away. He had
Bllowrd his whiskers to grow while camp-
Ir.s: and his hair was long. Before he re
turned home- the cart and harness had
been brought back by Thomas llaher, an
expressman. Cainan had shaved off his
whiskers and had his hair cut. He told
his wife hp had sold the horse.

Â¦ But for the prompt action of deckhand
Manuel Pinero of the California North
western Company's steamer Tiburon, a
second boating disaster, involving four
lives instead of two, might have been
added to last Sunday's tragedy at Belve
dere.
On Thursday night the four young
daughters ot Airs. Mary Wooll of San
Francisco rowed across In a frail boat
lrom the wharf belonging to Airs. Spring,
wltn wnomUriey are staying, to the Tibu
ron ferry slip, witn the intention of mwt
nig tneir brouier, who was expected borne
on the 8 o"clocK p. m. steamer. As he
tailed to come the young ladies put off
from the 1'ioneer whan, to wnicn they
had tied their boat, intending to row bacK
to .Belvedere. A few yards lrom shore the
swift tide caught them and despite all
their efforts to make headway against it,
drew them rapidly toward tne terry slip
in whicn lay tne big steamer Tiburon, her
great side wheels revolving. Panic at the
prospect of being swept under the beating
paddles seized tne occupants of the skill,
and, as they drifted rapidly past the end
of tne slip one of the young ladies caught
hold ot the timbers. The bout gave a
violent lurch under the sudden movement
and the next moment two young women
we-e struggling in the water, while the
two, >ft in tne skiff screamed for aid. One
of the girls in the- water managed to
catch the gunwale of the skiff and hold
on, but the other when she came to the
surface clung to one of the slippery piles,
while the swift current threatened every
moment to drag her from her hold to a
horrible death.
At this juncture Manuel Pinero appear
ed on the stern of the big ferry boat and
hurried to the rescue. Taking in the situ
ation at a glance he dived from the deck
and, coming up, grasped the almost sense
loss girl and placed her. on an adjacent
iloat, where she promptly fainted. In the
meantime Krik Hellstrum, another deck
hand, had appeared. He slid down a pile
and helped the three ladies In the boat
ashore, and they walked uptown with
their companion, while Hellstrum rowed
the boat to the Pioneer wharf.
The accident, coming as it did while
launches were at work dragging for the
bodies* of the victims of Sunday's catas
trophe, has caused the wildest excitement
In Tiburon and many declare that the
town is hoodooed. On Tuesday niKht two
other women were saved from death by
Fred Lewis, of the launch Norwood. They
were trying to board a boat at the Tibu
ron float when a sudden lurch sent them
both into the water. As they came up for
the second time Lewis grabbed them and
dragged them into safety. They refused
to give their names.
