NORTH GERMAN LLOYD STEAMSHIP BREMEN; BURNED IN THE HOBOKEN FIRE.
While .the loss to. the; North German Lloyd Company, is a tremendous one in money and three of their vessels are
destroyed, Mr. Capelle, the resident agent, says that there will be no interruption of their service, and that passen
gers who had secured berths on the vessels destroyed will be provided for as if nothing had happened.
NEW* YORK, July 1.â The loss on the
steamship properties and other
companies estimated to-night is
approximately as follows:
The steamship Main of the North
German Lloyd line cost $1,500,000 outside of
the cargo, fitting and stores. The less is
placed at $1,290 ,000 for the vessel and about
$400.0ij0 for the fitting and stores and the
cargo that was aboard of her.
The steamship Bremen of the North
German Lloyd line cost $1,250.00!) and her
fittings and cargo were valued at $300,000.
The c.irRo and stores were entirely con
sumed und the loss to the vessel proper
will amount to at least $750,000. She ia
benched oft We'ehawken to-night and still
smoldering, apparently destroyed ex
cepting her machinery.
The Saale. the steamship which wili
have the most horrible story of death to
unfold when the divers go down In her.
cost the North German Lloyd Company
$1,250,000. and the fittings and cargo jvere
valued at ?.">GO,000. The Saale Is beached at
Ellis Island and still burning. The dam
age to the vessel proper is placed at about
$S0O,POO. / Â¦
The damage done to the Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse is estimated at $23,000.
The three docks of the German line,
which were burned to the water's edge,
are estimated to have cost $300,000. The
decks were filled with merchandise ju3t
received from abroad and valued at $350,
000.
The Thingvalla pier, which was entirely
consumed, was valued at $50,000. counting
the stores which were on__it. The Ham
burg-American line dock, which had Just
been completed as an extension to their
great pier and which was destroyed in
order to prevent the spread of the names,
was damaged to the extent of $15,000. This
was the only loss they sustained, as the
steamer Phoenicia, contrary to reports,
was not even scorched.
The warehouses of Palmer Campbell,
houses K, F. G and H/were burned. Mr.
Campbell said to-night that he could not
give a definite estimate of his losses, but
the damage to buildings alone would
amount to at least $00,000 and the Contents
to $1,250,000. Had the fire occurred at any
other time in the year, he said, the loss
would have been much greater, as just at
the present time the imports are very
lignt and the houses ,were not well filled.
This statement accounts for the compara
tively small loss on the three piers of the
North German Lloyd line. One lighter
containing 5000 bags of sugar was de
stroyed, the loss being $27,000.
Barges and Canal Boats Lost.
Eight barges and eleven canal boats
were either burned or sunk with their car
goes. Total valuation, $123,000.
The Hoboken Shore Railroad had a num
ber of cars burned and other property
damaged. Loss $7000.
Minor losses on floating property, burned
at the fire proper or set on fire by burning
driftwood, will amount to about $20,000.
The personal losses sustained by those
aboard the steamships can simply be sur
mised, as there is no way of ascertaining
this at the present time.
Freight Manager Bonner said to-night
that the Main had about 5000 tons of cargo
in her hold. Of this there were- 2000 tons
of grain, 1000 tons of slag, about 3000 bales
of cotton and general merchandise. The
Saale had a full cargo. Including copper,
and general merchandise, but the. Bremen
had hardly any cargo. aboard. .' ; ~ .'
"I believe," Mr. Bonner said, "that tha
loss to the car^o on the three ships will
exceetl $1,000,000. Aa to the loss of cariro
on the piers, it is difficult to estimate,
for there was both inward and outward
bound cargo there.
"The greatest damagvs_0n the careo of
the Saale. will be that done by the wa
ter. I believe the hull of the Saale below
the waterline is all right and also her
engines. In a visit to the Bremen we
found that whi^e the hull is in good shape,
apparently, the cargo is lost. The Bremen
has a list to port and there is some dan
ger that she may break if she Iist3 fur
luer. ThÂ« Alain, like the Bremen. waÂ»
still burning when I was there."
Gustav Schwab, the agent of the North
German Lloyd Stemshlp line, said:
"Things are Jn a very unsettled condi
tion as yet and I have been hard at work
to-day gathering up the end3. I nave
been on a tour of inspection this morning
and In a tug visited all three of the
wrecked vessels, as well as the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grosse. She will leave on
her regular trip Tuesday at 10 p. m.
"The Saale was the first vessel we vlÂ»-
Ited. From there -we went to the Bremen
and the Main. Both of the vessels are
still burning. I should not say that any
of tlie vessels would be a total loss. They
look worse from the outside than they
really are. After they are pumped out
we can tell better what the loss will be.
Both the Bremen and the Suale are. how
ever, pretty badly damaged. "Wrecking
companies are working on the Saale and
she will be pumped out as soon as possi
ble.
"I will not give any figures, nor can I
estimate what the amount will be. The
loss on the ships will be estimated by the
home office. We received a cablegram
from them asking for Information. The
home office knows the value of the shifts.
I can only guess roughly at â e cost. Tho
piers In Hoboken are all insured in local
companies, but I do not feel that I can
give the names of the companies.
"There was on the pier a quantity of,
car^b. TYhlch, of course, was destroyed.
we are not responsible for the carico,

"The cargo on the pier comprised cot

said to-day that there was nothing now
to do but to follow out the course the
State â¢ Department has already . adopted,
namely, to have the United States Con
suls ,nut themselves into communication
with the Viceroys of th'e province?, treat
ing the central government at Pekine as
incapacitated for administrative work,
end meanwhile doing all in their power to
protect the . foreigners in their respective
districts. The signs of amicable disposi
tion on the part of these Viceroys is
probably the basis for the hope that they
c:in be kiduced at least to stand neutral
and keep their own provinces in order
i< it shall be necessary to direct hostilities
energetically against the Peking Govern
ment.
This Government has not yet regarded
the developments as demanding the as
sembling of Congress in extraordinary
session to declare war, and it is possible
that the dispatch of more reinforcements
to China from Manila and the United
States may not require Congressional ac
tion, as long: as the object is strictly to
succor Americans in distress and danger.
While there was no formal Cabinet
council to-day. Secretary Hay had with
him iit various times members of the
Cabinet for the discussion of the condi
tion of affairs in China. It is understood
no change of policy was determined upon.
Minister Wu said to-night that he had
not received anv dispatches during the
day from any part of China.

text is withheld, but the Consul states In
substance as follows:
"It is rumorpd in Shanghai that the Ger
man Minister to Pekinp. Baron von Ket
teler, was killM at Peking on the l?th of
June. On the 23d of June three of the le
gation buildings were still standing. The

June a dispatch was received at Shanghai
I from Yung Lu (believed to be the Viceroy
I of the province. of Chi-Li, where the prin-
I cipal troubles h*ve occurred) stating that
'the other Ministers were safe."
Dispatches to Shanghai from different

' cf the heir apparent, seems to be absolute
j ly in control at Peking-, and that his atti-
I tude Is the worst possible and most hostile
I to foreigners. It is even said that he is

VICEROYS EXPECTED f
TO REMAIN NEUTRAL
Plan to Deal Directly

Carried Out.
WASHINGTON, July l.-To-day's ad
vices to the State Department, made up
Â«.f two cablegrams from Consul General
Goortnow at Shanghai, brought the For
eign Ministers nt Peking along one day
further In safety, showing- that they were
all : live with the probable exception of
the Merman Minister, who/lt seems like
ly, ha* been murdered. Some encourage'
mem is 5*rawn by the officials from the
fact that the other Ministers were alive
on the latter date, for the officials believe
that the diplomatic corps at Peking could
not have been preserved through the fury
of the first stages of the outbreak only
to fall victims to sober second thought.
There 53 a!so at least the indication that
the Chinese Government itself was pro
tecting them. On the other hand, the
statementthat the notoriously anti-foreign
Prince Tuan was in complete control at
Peking was rogardod as an exceedingly
grave development, and as tending to fix
clearly the responsibility for the hapoen
lngsÂ» of the past three weeks directly upon
the Peking Government. An ameliorating
condition Is the refusal of the great Vlce
royp, themselves of almost absolute Dow
er In their provinces, to be controlled
from Pekine In their attitude toward for
eigners.
A high official of the State Department
S~\HA.NGHAI, July i. â The British Consul at Chcfu tclc-
V, graphs that Baron von Ketteler, German Minister at Pe
\^_J king, was murdered by native troops on June 18. Three
Itgatians â it is not stated which â were still undestroyed
on June 2$. The American Consul )iere says that Yunh Lu telc
;grafhe'd on June 26 that the other Ministers were safe that
morning. The situation zias desperate and he doubted zvhether
the Ministers could hold out twenty-four hours longer, as he and
Â¦ the. Empress could not longer give protection.
LONDON, July* 2.â Official dispatches received by the con
sular body at Shanghai, an Express cable dated Shanghai, July
j, says, confirm in the fullest manner the report of the butch
crx of Baron von Ketteler, the German Minister, on June 18.
Â¦.The Embdssador was riding in Legation street zi'licn he was at
tacked by Chinese troops and Boxers, dragged from his horse
and killed. 'Â¦ His body zvas hacked to pieces zvith swords. The
German legation and six other buildings were burned and a
number of servants of the legations killed and their bodies thrown
hit 0 .'the flames.
m
Official confirmation of this ghastly business has created
:':c utmost consternation among the Consuls General of ihe
powers. zJho expressed fears that z<ar a 1' out ranee zvill be dc
rtcrca against the Peking Government. The Consuls entertain
little Jwpic ikat any foreigners arc left alive in the capital. There
zvcrcioO: foreigners connected zi'ith the legations, fifty in the
'Â¦Custom-house, English and American tourists and others to the
Â¦ number of Jjd, and nearly 500 legation guards.
A disfiztcli to the Express from Nankin, June 30, says:
"French priests here have received reports from Peking that
public executions of foreigners have been in progress since June
2d... The nezi'S comes by runners from French priests at Pe
king^ z'vho state that they administered the last rites to the con
demned men."
: Nankin cables, dated Sunday, say that Viceroy Liu Yun
Yifi rcceiz'cd a telegram ftom General Yulu on Saturday stat
ing that the German Minister had been murdered at Peking.
Yulu, who escaped from^Ticntsin to Pao Ting Fu, also wired:
"Position desperate. Implore your help. Foreign troops of

GERMAN MINISTER WAS
SLAIN BY CHINESE TROOPS
TO ~T ElV YORK, July I. â The losses sustained in the fire at
I \ / * ne docks of the North German Lloyd Steamship
C 7 Company in Hoboken yesterday arc to-night conscn'a
tiyely placed at nearly ten million dollars; the loss of life
â merely guess zcork at even this late hour â will reach; proba^
My as high as 200, and there arc over 300 men in the, hospitals
in this city, Hoboken. and Jersey City badly bunted. ! .
Up to 11 o'clock to-night eighteen bodies had been recovered.
Eleven of these were placed in a rozvat the morgue in this city
and numbered, this being the only means the authorities have of
maintaining any sort of identity over the corpses, as they arc so
badly charred and dismembered that identification zvill be made
only by trinkets or pieces of clothing that were found about the
bodies. The only way the steamship officials have of approxi
mating the loss of life is by comparing the list of those reported
safe with the list of the employes on the steamships. ;.- "-..'
Late to-night Gustavc Schwab, the general agent of the
North German Lloyd line, gave out a list showing what; men on
cad: zrsscl had been missing up to that hour.
i, On the Saale 2jj men zverc employed and only 13 7 of these
had been accounted for up to 11 o'clock, leaving 128 men actual
ly enf ployed as officers, sailors, stczvards, engineers, coal pass
ers, oilers and trimmers to be accounted for. ": .
The Bremen had 204 men on board, but only 12 7 of these
have been found. The Main had 137 employes on board at tlie
time, and of these only seventy-six have been reported safe..'.
>* -. A spectacular but horrible sight zvas presented to-day.
Where, ''two days ago, piers reached hundreds of feet out into the
river and rose like great hills alive zi'ith outgoing and incoming
commerce, lay a great zcastc of burning and smoldering beams,
zi'ith here and there a remnant of a high brick wall. The three
immense piers of the North German Lloyd line zvere burned to
the waters' ripple, the Thingvalla pier lay smoldering, and a
part of the Hamburg-American pier, which had just been add
ed to their great piers,- were in ruins. Four large storehouses
of the Palmer Campbell Company are wrecked, and they, with
the piers, zvent to make up the appalling mass of debris, smoking,
sizzling and steaming. It covers over four city blocks and
reaches out into the river for over a thousand feet.
The loss of life will probably prove greatest when the wreck
of the Saalc has been searched. Already a number of bodies
have been taken off, and as soon as the fire in the hold has sub
sided there is cz'cry probability that many bodies will be found
belozv decks. Various tugboat captains claim to have seen
thirty or forty persons in one compartment just before the
Saalc went down.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July I.â Confusion reigns in the Democratic camp to-night and the issue of David B.
Hill's visit to Bryan at Lincoln to-day is awaited with expectancy by the public and with some anxiety
and apprehension by various Vice Presidential candidates. Hill arrived here to-day dramatically, but.
after a brief stay, made his exit so quietly that even his associates of. the New York delegation were un
aware of his absence until the train was speeding on its way to Lincoln. Hill was called by an urgent telegram from
Bryan. On this visit momentous issues depend, viz., shall the platform be modified to placate New York? -And
as the price of this, will Hill consent to be a. candidate, for Vice President? :
The hotel lobbies are fullof this sort of speculation to-nighL ' Dispatches quote Senator White of California as
having said he had received authoritative advice ;to the effect Hill would be a candidate provided an absolute i6-.to-i
plank were avoided by the convention. Senator White is not here to deny this report, for the California delegation. will
not arrive until to-morrow night, but those best posted declare with great positiveness' that Hill would under no cir
cumstances consent to accept the nomination for Vice President; He is looking forward to 1004, when he hopes to
lead the Democratic hosts to victory. Others declare with equal positiveness that Hill's personal disinclination is a sec
ondary consideration; that he will be nominated nolens volens, like Roosevelt, and that Hill will be compelled to stand
by his famous declaration, "I am a Democrat." State leaders in all directions appear to have determined that Hill
shall be nominated. The stampede of Republicans for Roosevelt at Philadelphia is fresh in the minds of the -.
Democracy, and they hope to instate this Republican performance and stampede the convention to Hill, who will be
too good a Democrat to decline.
Will Bryan consent to a modification of the platform? If so, will Hill accept the call of the Democratic hosts
and accept the Vice Presidential nomination? Some politicians who have the confidence of Bryan and others who
are close to Hill declare with positiveness that Bryan will under no circumstances consent to anything short of a
16-to-i declaration, and that Hill would not agree to accept the Vice Presidential nomination, even if 'Bryan should
consent. The Call's correspondent -received to-night from a prominent politician who visited Lincoln within a day
or two most reliable and definite information that Bryan will force the 16-to-i issue and wants Towne for his running
mate. There is no doubt of this. If any confirmation were needed, the action of the Nebraska delegation favorable
to Towne would be sufficient. Bryan scarcely hopes to carry New York or any other Eastern State, while he feels
confident that States like Michigan, Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas and others in which Populists hold balance of
power can be carried for Bryan and Towne.
â¢ Senator Jones agrees with him in this, and so do many other Democratic leaders, but ex-Governor W. J.
Stone of Missouri is a dissenter, and' for this reason the New York and other Eastern delegations threaten to de
pose Jones as chairman of the National Committee and boost Stone into his place. This promises to be one of the -
warmest fights of this convention. If Bryan turns Hill down, as predicted by the knowing ones, the question then
arises, Will the Democratic convention defer to the wishes of Mr. Bryan" and nominate a Populist as his running
mate? >
"Yes, declare rampant Bryanites.
"No," yell the New Yorkers. "The East wants no anarchistic ticket. Democracy must not be hitched up with
Populism."
The Call correspondent is enabled to state on authority that Hill's candidate is Elliott Danforth of New York,
and the New York delegation is declaring with emphasis to-night that the convention is not only wild for Hill, but if
the latter declines and wants Danforth nominated the convention will do his bidding.
Thus there are three anxious factions awaiting news from Lincoln â the Bryan and Towne men, the Hill
(or Danforth) crowd and the fellows who hope that Shiveley of Indiana may be selected as a compromise candidate.
But the most interesting gossip of to-night is heard around the headquarters of the Eastern delegations. It is
nothing short of startling expressions of doubt whether Bryan, seeking to dictate both platform and running mate,
will not be himself turned down by the convention. The Bryanites pooh-pooh this suggestion, but the New Yorkers
truthfully point to the fact that underlying Bryan's great personal popularity is the prevailing doubt of the wisdom of
nominating Bryan on a i6-to-i platform.
"It means certain defeat," declare the New Yorkers. "You can't hope to win without New York and other
Eastern States."
"Will Bryan. weaken? No." Representative Richardson of Tennessee, Democratic leader in the House of
Representatives, brought this positive information from Lincoln to-day. He and Chairman Jones and other leaders
went into a conference. Various modifications of the silver plank were proposed, but to each Richardson declared "16
to I or nothing." Angry expostulations were then heard. and declarations were made that unless Bryan would stand
on the platform of the Democratic party he could not be its candidate for President.
It is stated on most excellent authority to-night that Bryan sent word to-day he would not accept the nomina
tion unless the convention declared unequivocally for 16 to i. Governor Thomas of Colorado saw Bryan and
brought his ultimatum to Kansas City.
"I am not in a position to say what ac
tion the Wisconsin delegation will take "
said he. "1 have had very little communi
cation with the members of the delega
tion, and until we get together and talk
over the situation It would be useless for
me to nay whom we will support for the
nomination. The full delegation will not
'1 he Senator went on to speak in the
most kindly terms of Mr. Suizer, saylnjr
that ho would be a (rood candidate
The advance guard of the Wisconsin
delegation, headed by Mayor Rose of Mil
waukee nnd J. M. Clancy of Madison, who
holds National Committeeman Wall's
proxy, arrived to-day. Mayor Rosa was
non-committal on the question of ,the
Vire Presidential nomination.
As to the candidacy of Mr. Suizer, the
Xew Yorkers take the same position thev
do regarding every other New York man
who is mentioned for Vice President.
"If the convention wants him," said
Senator Murphy, "New York will support
him.
If he does, asserted one i,cw Yorker,
"you will see Hill rhalrraan of the com
mittee. But that -will depend upon the
result of the conference at Lincoln."
During the day there was some talk
about the differences between Croker and
Hill. Some of the pronounced anti-Hill
men Sn the New York contingent are said
to be urging Croker to turn Hill down for
everything, not even to give him one of
the minor committee places. Van Wyck
and Hill are both anxious to represent
New York on the resolutions committee.
Van Wyek has already drafted a plat
form, which he has been showing to dif
ferent delegates. In case of a clash be
tween .these men it Is said that Croker
could control the delegation for Van
Wyck, but the belief is that in the Inter
est of harmony he will erive Hill what he
wants and that the ex-Senator will serve
on the resolutions committee.
The New York leaders who are known
as the Croker faction did not meet ex-
Senator Hill after their arrival in the city.
Mr. Croker, ox-Senator Murphy and Judge
VanjWyck had conferences with Senator
Jon*? and other Democratic leaders dur
insrihe day. but little developed regarding
either the platform or the Vice Presiden
tial candidates. <;, .
"Will New York support Hill for Vice
Pn^Mont?" Mr. Murphy was asked.
"Yes. if the convention wants him, and
he would be a strong candidate, too. Up
has strenRth throueh the State and would
poll a good vote. The organization would
give him hearty and loyal support If he
should be named. New York is not pre
senting any candidate, but will support
any one the convention wants."
Mayor McGuire of Syracuse passed
through the city early to-day en route
to Lincoln, Nebr.. to call upon Mr. Bryan.
Before he left Syracuse he received a
telegram from Mr. Bryan requesting him
to come to Lincoln before he went to the
convention. Mayor McGuire favors the
nomination of former Governor Hill for
Vice President. <- V.:
"As to the platform," continued Mr.
Danforth in response to Inquiries, "the
position of the New York Democracy was
very well defined in our State platform.
Our people, by the attitude of their rep
resentatives in that convention, are not
in favor of having the platform adopted
by the Kansas City convention emphasize
a declaration that the money issue is of
paramount importance. Personally I gave
cheerful and cordial support to the can
didates and platform of 1896 and. I will
gjve the same earnest support to the can
didates and platform of 19oO. To my mind
new issues of vital importance not alone
to the Democratic party but also to the
people of the United States, without refer
ence to party affiliations, have arisen.
These issues will be pressed to the front
in the approaching campaign, not so
much, perhaps, because they are set out
In political platforms aa because they are
the issues in which the people themselves
are most deeply interested."
"In the 'ordinary acceptation of the
term," said 31r. uanfortn, "1 am not a
candidate for the Vice Presidency or for
any other office. Our delegation is not
here yetâ at least all of the members are
notâ and as no conference has been held
by the delegates no course of action has
been mapped out. I should bo pleased to
be a candidate, for Vice President with
Mr. Bryan, but 1 am not seeking the nom
ination and shall not, believing that the
convention will do that which is wisest
and best.
Klliott DanforUi of New i'ork was one
of the early callers to-day at the apart
ments of former Governor Hill. He dm not
see Mr. Hill, as the latter already had left
for Lincoln.
So far as the free silver issue was con
cerneu. Dr. Cosby saic!. the platform had
not been discussed and he uid not know
Mr. Croker's opinion on that matter.
"les, benator Will. 1 Know these are
Mr. Croker's sentiments. The platform,
as adopted by the convention will be our
platform."
"Tammany rather favors the nomina
tion for the Vice Presidency of a man.
from a ciose Western State, say Ohio or
Indiana," said Dr. Cosby. "But whoever
the convention in its wisdom sees tit to
nominate will receive loyal support and
we will expect to win with him. Benja
min Shiveley of Indiana would make a
nrst-class man. But any one, so long as
he is a good Democrat."
"Senator Hill, lor instance?"
KANSAS CITY, July 1.â Richard Croker;
Dr. Cosby, Health Commissioner of Xew
York City; former Senator Murphy, An
drew Freedman and other leaders of Tam
many Hall were the tirst of the New York
delegation to appear. They arrived this
morning fatigued from the long railway
ride and remained in their apartments
most of the day. Mr. Croker and Senator
Murphy, however, visited the convention
hall during the afternoon. Neither would
talk on politics.

DELEGATES AT SEA
ON THE MAIN ISSUES
! "Will 'Mr. BÂ«-yan be consulted as to_the
I Vice Presidential candidate?"
"I think not. Any one selected by the
i convention will be acceptable to Mr.
Bryan."
Prince David was asked to-day by an
Associated Press representative what rec-
Lbgnftlon the.Hawaiians expected at the
i hands of the convention.
"We certainly expect the convention to
i follow the precdent set by the Republicans
I at Philadelphia, where the island dele
! gates were .permitted to sit among those
from the States," replied the Prince.
"Has your organization any special pur
> pose In- sending a delegation to Kansas
City?"
"We wish to be generally recognized by
i'the people as a part of the United States.
, 1 don't know that we have any spjecial
. purpose other than tliat. The Republicans
| organized and sent delegates to Philadel-
I phia. so those of us having Democratic
Â¦ tendencies did likewise."
Delegates Stop Over at
Pueblo Instead of Going
to Colorado Springs.
PUEBLO.. Colo., July l.-The California
end Hawaiian delegations to the National
Democratic Convention, arrived here over
the Rip Grande at "p. m. and left by way
of the Santa Fe at midnight. They are
due to arrive at Kansas City at 6:40 p. m.
on Monday. - ;"'Â¦â¢"Â¦'
Owing- to the lateness of the train the
delegation decided to stop over at Pueoio
Instead of going to Colorado Springs. The
rest of five hours was welcome to the par
ty, the time, beinsr devoted to serenading
the city under the guidance of prominent
local Democrats.
Former Congressman Jam<s G. Magulre,
delegate at large from California and rec
ognized as one of the sta richest admirers
of \y. J. Hryan on the Pacilic Coast, was
asked to-day as to the probable action ol
the platform committee at Kfinsas City
concerning a speciric mention of 15 to 1.
"I -would not hazard an opinion on the
FUbjcct." said Mr. Maguiro. â¢'That is
t-oxnethirg which will come prominently
before' the committee at an early meet
ing."
"Do you think Mr. Bryan's wishes will
be considered in this connection?" was
asked. â¢
"I. do not" believe Bryan will attempt to
Influence the action of the convention in
the slightest, manner." was the reply.
"The committee on platform will be free
Trithcru regard to outside influences."
"Has California any choice of candidates
for the Vice Presidential nomination?**
"No; California will be in favor of the
candidate: for Vice President who can
command, the strongest. . support in the
Middle Worn, as w* believe the States of
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois will be the great
fcattlosTouhd tn this campaign."
"On what grounds do you base that the
ory?"
"On ' the fact, that these three States
have" a' very â¢ strong German vote, which
â¢will be cast against the Republican candi
dates next November. The sentiment of
the .Germans of this country has beon
arouecd in; opposition to the administra
tion's policy in dealing' with the Boer vAr.
Â¦ Furthermore', the imperialistic .policy of
the Republican party is unpopular with
the German voters, a great number of
â¢whom came to this country to get away

Indiana made great strides to-day. He
has a respectable boom. That of Hill,
however, eclipses all others, and he is. th"

boom a great boost to-day when all but

are the admissions of ex-Senator MurphT

Regarded Among the
Strongest Men.; i]
KANSAS CITY, July 1.â The Democrat
ic .Vice Presidential nomination, is still
for anybodyâ that is, anybody who can
reach it. Here is' a list to choose from:

these are "mentioned." Some are avowed
candidates and otht-rs are not and same'
do not even expect to be presumed to tftd '
convention. : .. Â¦ .â¢ Â¦ Â¦ .â¢ .. -. â¢ :
The foremost are Suizer and Towne.
Others expect a complimentary vote, but
both of these gentlemen want the nomina
tion, and their friends are working for
them with much earnestness. Friends
of Shiveley are also pressing him, but
the Indiana man Is discouraging. Shiveley
has his eye on a seat. in the Senate, which
is more attractive to him than a, nomina
tion for the Vice Presidency. He does, noc
care to offend his Indiana friends by be
ing churlish regarding the Vice Presi
dency, but he is doing what be can to Â¦
discourage the talk about, himself. The
friends of Towne say Shiveley Is not. and,
will not be a candidate. Another man
who is strongly mentioned is Carter H.
Harrison of Chicago. Illinois men say he
prevented the State convention from nam
ing him for Governor or instructing for
him for Vice President. It i3 expected he
will come here and make It plain that ho
does not wish to be a candidate.
Among- the incipient booms launched to
day were those of ex-"Senator Gorman and
Governor McMlllin. Henry D. . Clayton, .
member of the National Committee from
Alabama, talked about Gorman : as an,
available candidate, while BucJc Hinrlch
sen of Illinois was sponsor for McMlllin.
Mr. Clayton said the South would take
very kindly to Mr. Gorman and; although
he was not a sliver man, there was no
doubt about his earnest support of the
party. Hinrichsen and McMUlin' had a
record of twenty years in Congress which
could not be touched and that he was a
vote-getter in other States besides Ten
nessee. - .
Quite an interesting and unknown quan
tity Is the suggestion about ex-Senator
Hill. He seems to have considerable
strength in different parts of the country
and several delegations intend to vote
for him. When ilr. Hill arrived here 'to
day and was taking his breakfast In the
Coates House a man experienced in con
ventions sajd: â¢ '
"Hill is poing to be nominated for Vice
President." . - : Â¦ .
KANSAS CITY. July 1.â The plat
form to be adopted by the Demo
cratic National Convention will
contain a declaration for the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 1*5
to 1, unless Mr. Bryan changes his
attitude, and each fresh arrival from Lin
coln brings renewed assurances that the
foreordained nominee of the convention is
maintaining his position in favor of the
declaration.
Occasionally a delegate can be found
who will take the position that not even
Mr. Bryan can be allowed to dictate the
party's platform, but a majority agree
that as all the delegates are practically
instructed for the renomlnation of the
candidate of 1SD6 he has an exceptional
right to ask to have the resolutions har
monize with his views on any or all sub
jects.
However, while it is true that the indi
cations point strongly to the specific ut
terance here outlined, there is still a very
determined opposition to such a course.
This opposition apparently originated with
former Senator Hill of New York and his
following, and it has been taken up by
other leaders in various sections of the
country. The Tammany interest of New
York appears to be entirely reconciled to
any silver plank, however extreme, but
other factions unite in opposing it. Judge
Van Wyck; Elliot Danforth and J. Brisben
Walker al! unite with ilill in this posi
tion, though disagreeing with him as to
motives. Mr. Uanrorth agrees with Judge
Van W'yck that there' are other questions
more important for consideration, and
while still professing the utmost loyalty
to the white metal he contends that in the
interest of the party it should no longer
be given the place of, paramount* impor
tance in the declaration of principles.
Many Conflicting Views.
Senator James K. Jones, chairman of
the National Committee, and ex-Governor
Stone of Missouri, both of them recog
nized as stanch leaders of the silver senti
ment, are of the opinion that a reafflrma
tion of the Chicago piattorm is uii tnat
.Is necessary. Governor Stone said to-day
that he considered the differences that
have manifested themselves a mere quib
ble, but he declined to say whether he
would be . willing to stop with the re
aftirmatioh of the declaration of 1SI.J.
Many Southern delegates express them
selves as indifferent on the point and>ure
inclined to make the concession demanded
by the Hill sentiment. National Commit
teeman Campau is also inclined to subor
dinate the question of ratio to other sub
jects of current importance.
On the other hand, George Fred 'Wil
liams announces that he considers the fin
ancial question still of the greatest im
portance, and says he feels confident that
the New England delegates are practically
solid in that position.
"The free coinage of silver at the ratio
of 16 to 1 was the touchstone of the con
vention of 1S9*V' he said to-day, "and its
reiteration will add strength to the cause
in the coming campaign."
James Kerr, a delegate at large from
Pennsylvania and secretary of the Con
gressional Campaign Committees, takes
a somewhat different view, but he would
not stop at a mere declaration for the
Chicago platform. He holds that new
conditions will render it necessary to add
something to what we said on trusts in
lS9tj. and he says to make an addition on
that subject and not make it on the
finances would be considered as invidious,
and would result injuriously. He, how
ever, would not use the phrase lt> to 1,
but would declare for free coinage at "le
gal ratio."
Silver Republicans' Attitude.
It is expected that the Silver Republi
can party will ask to be consulted upon
the question of the tinancial plank. The
representatives of that party already
here express a strong preference for a
positive declaration for the old ratio, v. .
"We want 16 to 1," said former Senator
Duboi3 of Idaho to-day, "but if they will
put Towne on the ticket with Bryan we
will be willing to make concessions on
the money plank. If, however, such a
man as Hill Is to be nominated, we want
an iron-clad sliver platform. Thus you
see," the ex-Senator added, "the person
ality of the Vice Presidential candidate
may have a decided influence upon the
platform, and vice versa. Bryan and
Towne would be a platform in them
selves."
Mr. Bryan's position, as outlined by
those close in touch with him. is this:
He holds that the popularity of the Dem
ocratic ticket in 1S96 wag due very large
ly to the positive posttion taken on tne
silver question, ana that to take a back
ward step at this time would be an evi
dence of faltering, and would weaken
the ticket In its own strongholds "with
out strengthening it where there is no
hope of winning. He even goes so far
as to say that he regards the platform
of more importance than the ticket. He
thinks, also, if he should take any other
position he would be accused of vaccilia
tion, and that, in short, everything is to
be lost by making a change, while noth
ing is to be gained by It.
Silverites Arc Confident.
Those who agree with Mr. Bryan on
this point contend that there is no pos
sibility of his changing front before the
time arrives for the party's official dec
laration, and they consider It preposter
ous that the convention should disregard
h'.s wishes on this point. Hence they con
tend with great confidence that whether
the Chicago platform is reaffirmed or not
there will be an unequivocal pronounce
ment for the old ratio.
Kor the rest, the resolutions will de
nounce the gold standard and the Porto
Rican .legislation of the last session of
Congress. It will condemn trusts in un
measured terms, and at the same time ac
cuse the Republican party of fostering
and maintaining them. The administra
tion will come in for a strong censure for
its policy In the Philippines, and it will
be recommended that the Philippine arch
ipelago be placed upon the same footing
as Cuba. In the same connoection there
will be planks denouncing militarism and
Imperialism, and there will also be planks
on the Income tax, good roads, civil ser
vice, pensions, etc., and a strong resolu- '
tion of sympathy with the Boers.

KANSAS CITY, July l.-The Vice Pres

BRYAN HURRIEDLY SUMMONS DAVID B. HILL
TO SECRET CONFERENCE AT HIS LINCOLN HOME
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALLj MONDAY, JULY 2, 1900.
Continued on Third Pagre.
Regarding the Vice-Presidential matter.
Mr. Gahan t said that his , State had not
yet taken any stand. It is known, how
ever, that Illinois Is In favor of .the nom
ination of . . Carter H. Harrison, and be
lieves that we can secure the second place
more Hotel. Judge Johnson, delegate at
large, from Peabodv. Kans., said soon
after the delegation had arrived:
"We have, not really organized as yet,
and we are hardly In a position to make
any declaration of principles. We are, of
course, for the reafflrmation of the Chi
cago platform, and desire the insertion of
a plank in the platform calling for 1G to 1.
We have as yet made no formal canvass
of the delegation, but I know that it is the
way in which the Kansas men will stand
on the silver proposition.
"As to the Vice Presidency, we have no
particular choice as yet, and as we feel at
present we will without doubt follow the
lead of the State of New York and suppn^t
any man Â¦whom It may decide upon.- We
feel rather friendly to all of the Vice Pres
idential candidates, however, and really
have no particular favorite. The Vice
Presidency is largely a matter of expe
diency at the best, and we will be â¢ dis
posed to go for the man who can throw
the most strength to the ticket."
The Illinois delegation will not arrive in
force until Tuesday, but several members
are on the ground. Including National
Committeeman Gahan. In discussing the
stand to be taken by the delegation on the
silver proposition, Mr. Gahan said to-day:
"What Illinois adopted in its platform
is known all over the United States, and
we have seen , no reason to change our
position. We said at our State Convention
that we were In favor oi the reafflrmation
of the Chicago platform in spirit and let
ter, and we made no mention of figures in
discussing, the silver plank of our plat
form. We stand in just that position,to
day, and the, chances are that we will stay
there until the end." , .
be here until to-morrow night probably."
"How about Hill?"
"Well, Mr. Hill has friends wherever
you will find Democrats," he replied.
Committeeman Clancy was very pro
nounced in his advocacy of the nomination
of Hill.
"We want a man who can carry New
York against Roosevelt," said he. "Hill
can do that. He will bring more votes to
the ticket than any man we can put up,
and I believe he will be nominated. There
is a very strong sentiment in i his favor
among the members of the Wisconsin del
egation, with whom I have talked, and I
believe there will be a regular Roosevelt
boom developed for Hill before the con
vention is called to order. Among the Wis
consin delegation the nomination of
Charles A. Towne was not regarded with
favor.
"We want a Democrat, not a Populist,"
said Mr. Clancy. "Towne is an impossi
bility. Don't you think so?" he asked,
turning to Mayor Rose. The latter nodded
assent. A specific free silver plank in the
platform did not find supporters, in the
delegation, most of those who Â¦â¢ cared to
say anything at all favoring the simple
reafflrmation of the Chicago platform.
The Pennsylvania delegation, 100 strong,
under the leadership of Colonel James M.
Guffcy, reached here to-day. One of the
delegates at large is ex-Governor Robert
E. Pattlson, who has been spoken of as a
possible Vice Presidential candidate. The
delegation, however, favors D. B. Hill,
and unless the situation changes greatly
the sixty-four votes of Pennsylvania will
go to the New Yorker. As outlined by
Colonel Guffey. the delegation also favors
a.blmetalllst plank In the platform with
out reference to a specific ratio. The ut
most harmony prevails throughout the en
tire delegation.
The Kansas delegation arrived In force
to-<Jay and took up quarters at the Balti-

HILL'S SUDDEN pip
TO iRif^ HOME
the Kansas City convention, hut he is
here as a representative of the New York
Democracy, and will support both the
ticket and the platform agreed upon after
such mature deliberation as the conven
tion will give both."
"Is I fill a candidate for the Vice Presi
dency?" General McEwan was asked
bluntly.
"He is not." he replied with emphasis.
"You understand, or course, that I do
not speak fcr Senator Hill further than
that.' r
"Then he would accept the nomination
for Vice President if it were tendered to
him?"
"That is a question which* only Hill
himself can answer." said General Mc-
Ewan, cautiously. "He alone knows what
he would do in any given set of circum
stances. He is not a candidate, however."
The summons received by Hill from
Bryan created the first distinct sensation
of the ante-conventlon proceedings. While
few people saw Hill before he left for
Nebraska, the fact that he had gone at
the request of Bryan was soon noised
about the hotel corridors and was the
principal topic of, discussion. Opinions
varied widely as to the object of the con
ference, but nobody had any really defi
nite Information: the gossip was spec
ulative purely. In some qupartes It was
suggested that Hill's visit was not In re
sponse to a summons from Bryan, but
was prompted by a desire on the part of
the Xew Yorker to - have a talk with the
Democratic leader regarding the financial
declaration to be made in the platform.
It is known that Hill does not desire a
distinct declaration In favor of 16 to 1,
and it will be his effort to induce not only
Bryan but also the convention to accept
a modified llnancial plank. which,
while not specifically declaring for
the free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to I. will be such- a
tcafllrmatlon /ot the Chicago platform
on that subject as will prove satisfactory
to all elements of the party.
Later in the day it was suggested that
Hill might not return to Kansas City be
fore to-morrow. His conference . with
Bryan, It was said, was to be of such
importajacQ-tliat It. could not be deposed
that he r.as much fatigued from his long
trip from Â»w York. Hill felt that he
must obey the summons from Bryan and
in a few "minutes was on his way to the
railway station. The only train for Lin
coln was composed of day coaches, but
Mr. Hill boarded tt, expecting to arrive
at Lincoln about 7 o'clock this evening.
He hopes to get a late train out of Lin
coln to-ri1ght and reach Kansas City to
morrow morning.
While declining to be Interviewed on the
political Fituation, Mr. Hill said as he left
the hotel:
"I am much f&tlgued after my long trip
tnd ol my own accord, would not feel dis-
V' s ed to do more traveling at this time,
t>ut a summons from Mr. Bryan in the
''.circumstances is a call to duty and I am
j XWing to Lincoln by the first train that
twill take me there."
Tly. telegram calling Hill to Lincoln
conytyed n o intimation as to Mr. Bryan s
object in summoning the distinguished
New Yorker. Mr. Hill WmFClf disclaimed
{ any knowledge nf the purpose in Mr.
BryanV inind when he sent the telegram
and a<2d*(] that, even if he knew the ob
ject of thÂ«. visit, it would be Improper for
him to (lisrups it.
General McEwan, who is one of Hills
cl-opest political friends, having for many
year? Icpii one of his right-hand men in
the Empire State, did not accompany him
to Lincoln.
VI have no knowledge." paid he. "of
the reasons which Impelled Bryan to call
Hill to Lincoln. To me; the telegram from
Bryan was not a surprise, as he desires,
doubtles?. to be in close touch with peo
ple from all parts of the country."
"Do you think J3ryan desires to discuss
thÂ« platform with Hill?"
"Possibly," replied General McEwan.
smilinglv. "It would be quite natural
that they should have some confidences
to exchange on the subject." \
"It Is reported that Hill has a draft of
the planks of the platform that will be
sati5factory to the New York and Eastern
Democrats generally." was suggested.
"Oh. that is newspaper gossip," replied
General McEwan, evasively. "The Gov
ernor quite naturally has his Ideas of
what ought to bÂ« thÂ» declarations - of
of in time to enable the Governor to leave
Lincoln to-night in time to reach this city
to-morrow morning.
PROBABLE RESULT
OF THE CONFERENCE
?
Special Dispatch to The Call,
LINCOLN. Nebr., July l.-David Ben
nett Hill reached Lincoln to-night at 7
o'clock, and was met by Mr. Bryan and
taken at once to the home of the latter,
where they remained in conference until
nearly midnight. Hill came to Lincoln at
the request- of Bryan, who has up to to
day very successfully acted the role of
candidate and public dictator. Whether
the New Yorker is to be a part of his po
litical machine to follow instructions
rather^than his own ideas depends en
tirely upon to-night's conference, at the
conclusion of which each refused to be
interviewed. The only indication of what
transpired was contained In a telephone
message from Mr. Hill to the group of
newspaper men at the Lincoln Hotel,
which was:
"The Supreme Court Jias been sitting
two hours, and has not changed Its In
dividual opinion." ..
Previous to the conference both men
entertained widely different views on the
advisability of adopting a new silver
plank, and there is every reason to be
lieve they- still adhere to their former
positions. This being true. Hill will prob
ably not secure Bryan's cordial supixirt
for the Vice Presidency.
The feature of the day In Lincoln aside
from the .visit of Senator Hill was the re-
Eort that a draft of the' platform. Bald to
ave the indorsement of Mr. Bryan and
meeting, the approval of his friends in
nearly, half the States of the Union, has
been made. According to the rumor -it
makes the three leading Issues of the cam
f&igu imperialism, militarism and trusts*
in the order named. The financial plank,
according to the present draft, will be sec
ondary. There will be. It is said, a brief
plank reaffirming the Chicago platform,
and in that plank is the reafflrmation of
16 to 1. income tax. repeal of the current
laws and minor issues. ; â¢
BRYAN UNSHAKEN
IN HIS OPINION
Special Dispatch to The CaI1 -
NEW YORK. July 1.â The World has
this from IJncoln: Bryan said to-day:
"I am in favor of reaffirming the Chi
cago platform in general; also the adop
tion of a plank explicitly renewing the
pledge for free sind unlimited coinage of
silver and gold at the ratio of 16 to 1. An
explicit plank on the money question Is.
of the highest importance. If we are to
have a dodger for a platform then let us
have a dodger for a candidate: but if we
are to nominate a man who believes In
being explicit in pledges to the people,
thnn let us adopt a platform that will be
consistent with the character and record
of the candidate." v;
New York-Indiana Alliance.
KANSAS CITY. July l.-Three of the
delegates at large from Indianaâ James
Murdock, G. V. Menzles and Hugh Dough
erty â called on Richard Croker this after
noon to propose an alliance, offensive and
defensive, between the States of Indiana
and New York. The proposal is said to
have pleased Mr. Croker. and he told the
Indiana men that he would be glad to take
it under advisement

H. Ostrander, a stock-raiser from Mer

He is 74 years of age, and when but 7
years old made one of the first trips on
the railroad constructed in 1S33 between
Schenectady and Albany, New York. Os
trander stated that the opening of this
road produced scarcely less enthusiasm
than that with which the people of the
valleys hailed the advent of the new
Santa Fe system.
Most of the officials traveled as far as
Stockton and returned on the first over
land train that arrived at Point Richmond
last night. This last named train was in
charge of Conductor H. H. Sturgill, with
L,. Baker on the engine. It had been made
up similarly to the train that departed in
the â Â«rnlng. The patronage the road may
expect is evidenced by the fact that near
ly 350 passengers were carried from Stock-
ton to this city.
Chief Kngineer "W. B. Storey, who super
vised the- construction of the road, ex
pressed delight at the successful trips of
the initial passenger trains, and said that
within two weeks the depots and tracks
along the route would be In perfect con :
dltion.

Boxes of choice fruit were given every
passenger. The train was given a grand
ovation. People cheered, shouted and
waived handkerchiefs and hats in honor
of the occasion. A brass band was In at

dispatches." '
At the same time the Secretary is hope
ful that the next twelve hours will bring
a message from Captain Wilde. He point
ed /Out that the department's cablegrams
from the East usually come early In the
morning. It Is believed that both the Iris
and the Zaflro have by now reached the
Oregon and are probably lightening her
bv removing her coal and ammunition.
Naval constructors here point out that
the longer the Oregon remains Impaled
on Pinnacle rock, the greater damage she
will sustain. The tremendous rise and fall
of the tide at the point where she lies and
the swift current that runs there must be
reckoned with, they say. in considering
what shall be done to float the vessel. If
the Oregon should be freed from the rock
which holds her fast she probably will be
hauled to a harbor in one of the i3lands
of the Mlaotao group and repaired suffi
ciently to make the voyage to Port Ar
thur.
The Russian Government has not yet re
plied to the request of Secretary Hay for
permission to dock the battleship at that
point, but there Is no doubt that It will
be granted.

THE SiLK PETTICOAT.
DR. ANDREW WILSON, F. R. S. E., is not an
authority on woman's dress, neither does he
know enough of the latest fashions to make his
opinion worth anything to a society dame, but none
the less he has thought it worth his while to con
tribute to the Edinburgh Scotsman a hearty approval
and general commendation of the colored silk petti
coat. He declares it to be a beneficent institution, and
expresses the hope that it will be a permanent fea
ture in feminine garmenting.
The doctor's admiration for the colored silk petti
coat is due neither io the richness of the fabric nor to
the beauty of the color. He commends it simply be
cause its presence among her garments inclines and
induces a woman to lift her trailing outer skirt high
enough above the ground to show the gleam of the
.-ilk. It is in the uplifting of the outer garment that
thft benefit comes, for according to the doctor a skirt
NT O sane man values property at the rate of human
J life, or would balance the worth of any inani
1 mate thing in the scale against that of a human
being; and yet there are some things of material con
struction, some works of human hjnds, that are so
associated with sentiment and feeling that their de
struction seems almost like the loss of a friend. The
heart itself is affected under such circumstances, in
spite of all cold reason can say, and men and women
sorrow as sincerely as they would over the death of
some great leader of the nations.
To the Anglo-Saxon race no other object of human
construction appeals so potently and so universally
as a ship. Ruskin, indeed, has said that a ship under
full sail is the most beautiful and the noblest of the
works of man. We all kno'w with what patriotic
pride Americans have cherished "Old Ironsides," and
how the British have kept the hulk of Nelson's brave
ship, "The Fighting Temcraire." All people of our
race at least sympathize with these feelings; and here
in California there has been growing up something
of the same sentiment regarding "The Peerless Ore
gon." Therefore, there is a deep anxiety felt con
cerning the extent of the disaster which has befallen
her at the mouth of Pechili Gulf, and shoud it, prove
to be her utter wreck there would rbe a widespread
sense of loss throughout the whole Pacific Coast.
It is truethc Oregon holds no such romantic place
in history or tradition as do the famous ships we have
named. She is of our own period, and romance has
not had time to spread a halo around her fame.
Moreover, she has done no such hard battling against
equal foes as other great warships have done. None
the less she has won her place among the craft that
nations delight to honor. Before she struck upon the
rock she was the foremost battleship in the world, the
mistres* of the seas. She had in her voyage, around
the Horn achieved a feat that startled the seamen of
every country into an outburst of admiration, and in
the battle off Santiago Bay had demonstrated a fight
ing power of the first magnitude.
Constructed in our own shipyards and bearing the
name of our sister State, the achievements of the Ore
gon have been naturally of the highest interest to the
Pacific Coast. There arc many good ships in our
new navy, but not one that holds such a place in
popular estimation, or is so associated with patriotic
sentiment. It i3 not in idle boast that to her name
has been prefixed the title "Peerless." She has mer
ited the distinction such a title confers, and it is to be
hoped she will be able once more to demonstrate her
stanch superiority by riding safely from the rocks that
threaten her destruction.

At the battle of Colenso he witnessed the

gallant effort of Lord Roberts' son to re
take them, and was subsequently under
fire during the entire day's operations. At
tnat time he received injifries whic.i neces

ports) withdrew from the I!oer army to

Since that L time the very same Stryn,

When General Uoberts was rt-nsured by
the English press several montns ago for

tian Dewet is conducting the most suc
cessful guerilla warlare in that State.
Two weeks ago. after his reported cap
ture by the Untish general. Dew. t T\nh
2000 Iioers destroyed twenty-five miles of
British railroad,* broke the British com
munications, killed and wounded i'JJ Brit
ish and captured 700. among them repre
sentatives of the blue blood of Grvat Brit
ain, captured a great British convoy with
provisions, clothing, blankets, etc.. <\nd
nearly captured General Kitchener, who
only escaped by a narrow margin on uw
horse. Two days later General Dewct at*
tacktd the British again forty miles from
the first place, destroying the railroad
there, captured GOO British, one cannon,
munitions of war, etc., and then disap
peared. As the British came in over
whelming numbers, they saw the clouds
of dust where the Boers disappeared, and
captured their laager.
That the British line of communication
has been broken for at least three weeks
proof has been given again by the famous
General Uewet, as he on June 24. near tlie
Zar.d river, captured several trains wlm
30W mall bags containing $2l).000 worth of
British postage stamps, together with rjp
plies for the army; on this raid 150 High
landers were also captured. Dewet, Botha
Steyn and other Boer-generals will b>? able
to carry on this war for two years to
come. The Boers suffer, but the British
suffer more.
General Koberts admits that he has D000
sick and wounded in Pretoria, and the
number of his sick and wounded south
of Pretoria down to Cape Town may per
haps be &0.000. Why docs he not pursue
Botha instead of marching back to the
Orange Free State under the pretense o*
trying to capture Steyn. Tho Boers have
again adopted their own natural warfare
assembling, attacking and defeating the
enemy, then disappearing" again as craick
\ ]y as they came.
The Boer war has continued now for
nearly nine rronths. the British losses as
admitted by them, number more than 40 -
000 men. besides an enormous loss from
sick soldiers. The financial loss is enor
mous, and Great Britain has gained noth
ing but the hatred of all civUized nation??
The situation in China requires the pres
ence of strong British reinforcements but
Lord Roberts is not willing to send mare
than lO.flOO of his men to China, because
he needs all of 24Q.0QQ British troopa in
South Africa.
The re is a strong probability that Rob
erts mav be attacked and driven out of
Pretoria before Ions:, but in any case the
situation at present is most satisfactory
to the Boer*.

I I AD any warning been needed to put the Ameri-
I I can people on guard at this season against the
ever menacing danger of fire it would be found
in the appalling disaster which has swept the steam
ship piers at Hoboken, and in addition to destroying
millions of dollars' worth of property caused an awful
loss of life. This calamity following so closely upon
that at Ottawa gives the year a dreadful record of
fire losses and ought to deeply impress the people
with the need of greater carefulness in handling any
thing likely to produce a conflagration.
In San Francisco we are not exposed to such immi
nent danger from fire as that which impends over
Eastern cities during the whole summer season. We.
have not the hot, dry days and nights that render
all sorts of inflammable material almost like tinder and
ready to catch fire and blaze out from the slightest
spark. Our fogs and cool winds are a blessing to us
in that way as well as in others; and, thanks to such
natural advantages and to the vigilance of our fire
men, San Francisco has thus far escaped anything like'
such fires as have devastated the cities of the East.
Still we arc not absolutely safe. Good luck may not
attend us always. The best fire department in the
world cannot check a great fire under certain circum
stances. That much was shown at Portland, at Chi
cago, at Boston, at Ottawa and now at Hobokcn.
The best safeguard against fire is that wise precaution
which prevents an outbreak.
We have already begun the celebration of the
Fourth of July. Yesterday the sound of firecrackers
was heard in almost every part of the city, and the
popping will go on with increasing frequency and
magnitude until the holiday is over. Experience has
proven that form of celebrating the day to be dan
gerous. Each succeeding year brings a long list of
fires following the Fourth. Hardly a single city or
town of any considerable sire in the United States
has escaped heavy losses in that way. A single fire
cracker may start a blaze that will destroy a block of
buildings before it can be checked. The Fire Depart
ment and the Police Department combined cannot
guard against such possibilities. There is needed a
general vigilance and carefulness on the part of the
public. Each householder should look carefully to
his own premises. That is his duty, and precautions
against fire should be a part of all preparations made
for the celebration of the Glorious Fourth.
BUSINESS CONTINUES QUIET.
\ 7 -HEAT and iron were the interesting staples
\ XI hit week. The former receded from its high
Â¦'*.".. mark and fell off steadily for several days
â¢ heavy realizing by large speculators who were
! â¢ d to take their profits, and by those operators
-rtiVJ thought that the rise had been overdone. There
v to news, however, to justify any marked decline,
;. reports, Governmental and private, corrobor
: Â¦Â¦ he earlier intelligence of the crop disaster in the
. .west. Toward the close of the week a reactior.
.1, foreign orders were to buy, and while there
*v-5 less excitement the tendency was decidedly
towzrd higher quotations again. Saturday's close,
however, was lower and dull.
:"-.:is crop failure in the Northwest cuts more ways
Â¦: one. Besides reducing the exportable surplus
it] American wheat it diminishes the earnings of
â¢ b't e railroads which tap thai country, advances
ri cs for minor cereals, and thus incidentally the
j:rUe of pork, which in turn gives provisions an up
v d tendency. In addition it affects the California
': ;d fruit trade, for the Northwest has been one of
e_; most generous customers in this line, and a wheat
failure there may mean smaller shipments of our dried
fruit thence.
Iron continued to drift downward. All associations
DOW recognize the market as an open one, with every
man for himself, v. hicii, of course, engenders more or
less cutting all along the line. Offerings are now in
excess of the demand, and prices are steadily declin
ing. Over thirty furnaces have gone out of blast, and
the reduction in quotations for structural iron has
proven disappointing, for the expected increase in
ihc demand has not appeared. The outlook for iron
is t.ow unfavorable.
Other great staples are also languishing. Groceries
ar>- an exception, su;Tar being higher, with a good
canning demand, and tea having been forced up by
tiie Chinese disorder. An advance in raw cotton,
owing to heavy rains in the South, has not prevented
a further decline in cotton cloth. Woolen mills are
closing down here zr.'l there, the demand having
failed to reach expectation*. A good deal of closing
down is also reported in the boot and shoe trade,
which is very dull, with a weakening and depressed
market for hides and leather.
The decrea:-e in the volume of business is shown in
continued loss in national bank clearings, those for
the week being io.6 per cent les^ than for the corre
sponding week la?t year. The failures were 207,
against 181 last year. All indications point to a dull
iriidsunmier. and as it Is a Presidential year no great
activity in trade need be expected until the election
is over. Every foar_years there is a stoppage in trade
on account of a Presidential election; and when it i*
considered t!tat this stoppaarc begins about six months
ahead and continues over the usual quiet winter sea
son, there is. a break of almost a year in business,
(imply because the American people arc electing a
Prc*i<!cr.t. There iÂ« something in this condition that
needs correction. Even in non-Presidential years
there is always a slackening of trade about the 1st of
December, which continues until along in February,
but lo aggravate this partial suspension into an inter
val of nine or ten months is a little too much. Re
duced to figures at least eight out of forty-eight
tnoi'ths arc quadrennially iosl. or partially so. to the
"-juntry's business. If the suspension were total it
would amount to a loss of 16 2-3 per cent: but as it h
only partial, the loss is smaller. Still, it is a sinister
condition at best, and when regarded closely carries
v.ithin it certain signs provocative of serious thought.
Trade in California shows no pronounced change
from last week. The State is quietly harvesting i
lar;:c and profitable crop of fruit and farm produce,
and it sending it av/ay by the steamer and train load
in satisfaction of a rapidly increasing demand. It is
nnqr.cnion.ibly a good year here, whatever it may be
in other parts of the country.

SOME OF THOSE WHO HELPED MAKE THE LETTER-CABRIEItS' OTJTHTG A SUCCESS.
TROUBLE 0T THE FUNERAL.
BY a natural, and, it seems, an irresistibly per
verse, instinct Democracy takes to faction fight
ing as a duck takes to water. When there is
nothing else to fight about every Democrat in camo
is perfectly willing to fight about nothing. Even the
crowds now going to Kansas City, on what is clearly
an errand to attend a political funeral, are diligently
seeking out occasions and causes for disagreement.
There is no possible chance to make a fight over the
nominee for the Presidency, so they are trying to ar
range for a shindy over the platform. It never oc
curs to them that if. they do not put Bryan on a silver
plank they will put him up a tree; and it would hardly
make any difference if it did occur to them. Lf they
cannot have a ruction on the platform there will be
no chance for a ruction at all, and so the platform
battle goes.
The only men of any eminence in the party who
appear to have a desire for peace are those two old
fellows, Morgan of Alabama and Watterson of Ken
tucky. They have been red-hot scrappers in their
time, but are not willing to waste their failing lung
power in a scrimmage over any such game as Bryan.
Watterson has declared that the platform will mean
nothing anyhow, and that it will make no difference
what is put in it. Morgan, on the other hand, advo
cates-the rcadoption of the Chicago platform in full,
and says: "The people will understand us if we do
that. A new alignment will lose us more than we
gain."
Morgan's statement is mild and fairly reasonable,
but the anti-silver men are rabid against it. One of
them says: "But it is not Senator Morgan's spurious
interpretation of the Chicago platform that gives an
evil distinction to his utterance. It is his shocking
confession that an appraisal of the loss and gain deter
mines the true course of the party. The votes, the
votes, he cries; throw principle to the dogs, but get us
the votes! And such votes! The votes of hairy,
bawling Populism, of debt repudiation, of anarchy -
breeding socialism, of all the March hares of politics
and of the shouting, headlong, mindless Bryan idol
ators who lately sought to throw him out of his seat
in the Senate that they might put in one of their own
stripeâ these are the voters Senator Morgan weighs
in the balance and finds them worthy to be courted
and kept, even at the cost of losing the support of the
voters who make up the bone and sinew of American
manhood."
The length of the step from the mildness of Mor
gan's statement to the fury of that reply shows the
rapid decrees by which the factions are hastening to
the scrapping point. When the fellows who rage
about "hairy, bawling Populism" run up against some
vigorous Bryanite shouting damnation to anybody
opposed to 16 to i the fun will begin, and we shall
have a circus at the funeral that will make Rome howl.

LETTER CARRIERS HAVE A
MOST ENJOYABLE OUTING
REPUBLICAN C0MP CLEANING.
PON the members of the executive and the
I I advisory committee of the Republican County
{_) Committee rest the responsibility or revising
the rolls of the Assembly district clubs and rectifying
any wrong that may have occurred, either by fraud or
by mistake, in making them up. The articles of the
plan adopted for the organization of the clubs are
explicit on that point. Article 4 declares: "Any com
plaint as to the fairness or justice of enrollment, and
any complaint as to the organization of any club as
hereinafter provided, shall be made to the joint execu
tive and advisory committee, or to a sub-committee
chosen by the same, and shall be promptly decided by
said joint committee, such decision to be final."
Under that rule honest Republicans who have rea
son to believe that frauds have been practiced by the
Kelly and Crimmins crowd in any district have a
means of relief at hand. It is their right and it is thei r
duty, to file complaints of any wrongs of which they
have knowledge, and thus enable the joint committee
to purify the rolls of stuffers and enable the honest
Republicans of the district to organize the club and
elect officers.
Even before a thorough investigation has been
made it is known that frauds have been perpetrated
in some of the districts. As was pointed out in The
Call yesterday proof can be produced that in certain
districts persons were permitted to enroll themselves
who are not residents of the district. There are other
districts where the saloon element, with all the toughs
and bummers under the control of the bosses, appears
to have so packed the rolls that the gang will be as
sured of control of the clubs unless a thorough purg
ing of the rolls can be made. Thus it will be seen
there is much work before the joint committee and
that the responsibility resting upon its members is
grcr.t.
It was reported in the Chronicle yesterday that
"compromises will be made in some of the district 5
and the delegates divided between the conflicting in
terests. The Kelly and Crimmins people say that if
they are not given satisfactory representation they
will start opposition clubs in the districts that are sub
jects of contention.'
If that report be true, and the Republican party be
required to compromise with the saloon bosses or to
fight them, there will be no hesitation about the
choice. Honest Republicans will have to fight Kelly
and Crimmins under any circumstances. There is no
compromising that issue. The only question if.
whether the disreputable bosses shall be permitted to
sneak into the Republican camp and fight honesty
there, or whether they shall be driven out and com
pelled to take the position of open foes instead of that
of treacherous and pretended friends.
It should not be left to these job hunting, roll
stuffing be sses to begin the contest against honesty
'"if they are not given satisfactory representation."
1 he fight should be forced on them. Wherever there
i? a Kelly and Crimmins ticket put up in the primary
election the honest Republicans of the district should
put up a clean ticket in opposition. There should oe
vo compromise whatever with bosses whose very
presence in the Republican convention would be a
disgrace that would discredit its actions and weaken
its influence with the voters.
There is no u?e piling up arguments on this issue.
1 he experience of the past has shown that the people
are intolerant of the saloon boss power in politics.
Any compromise with Kelly and Crimmins will en
danger the whale campaign. The time has come for
the Republican party to clean up the camp.. The
whole breed of reptiles that have crawled into it to
profit by its victories, or to strike a poisonous blow
at its true champions, must be driven out of it.
that trails along the street is not only a collector of
dust and dirt, but of disease germs as well, and is a
menace to public health.
In expounding his doctrine Dr. Wilson says: "The
main contention of the sanitarian is that a large
amount of septic dust (that is, dust liable to induce
disease) is brought indoors through the medium of
the sweeping skirt. Among the organisms thus liable
to be introduced into our homes is the bacillus of
consumption. It exists in a dried state almost every
where, and is certain to be gathered up by the skirt
off the pavement as a more than likely place for its
presence. Dusted off within doors, we then introduce
it to our houses, where it may infect us in due course.
Many other germs, harmless and the reverse, are thu3
brought within doors by long skirts, and of the pos
sible state of underclothing produced by this habit the
less said the better. The woman with a trailing dress,
however, is a nuisance to others as well as. to herself.
She raises a maelstrom of dust as she wends her way
along the pavement, and those who come after her
and those who meet her have to encounter the mi
crobic breeze to which she has given origin."
"Microbic breeze" is a good phrase for a bad thing.
It is sad to think that lovely woman should cause it:
but since it is so we can sympathize with the statement
of the Edinburgh scientist: "When women have to
lift their dresses in order to show forth the rainbow
hues of the petticoat, one may be able to proclaim the
old saying about Solomon in his glory, while we at
the same time thank heaven they are keeping their
skirts off the ground."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 2, 1900

Bobert Trewln Badly Injured. Â»
Robert Trewln, ex-steward at the Re
ceiving Hospital, met with a serious ac
cident Saturday. He was on an electric
car ln the Poterero and signalled it to
stop. Before he reached the ground the
car started and he was thrown violently
forward on his face. His right arm was
broken, â¢ his teeth knocked out and his
face cut and bruised. He was taken to
the railroad company's hospital for treat
ment.
Battered His Father.
W. W. McNeill. a printer in the rail
way mall service living on Fillmore street
near Waller, was arrested yesterday by
Policeman Haley on charges of using vul
gar language,- disturbing the peace and
battery. The complaining witness is D.
W. McNelll. his father. The father called
upon the son yesterday to collect some
money he had loaned him and a fight en
sued. The young man was. taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where a contusion of
his right hand was dressed, and ho was
then taken to the prison. He said he in
jured his hand by accidentally striking
it against a door, but it is alleged he
gtrucK at his father's face and landed on
the wall.
FDURTH OF JULY is beginning
early this year. The Injured small
boy is In evidence at the Harbor
Hospital even st'this date and is
sure to grow more numerous as the days
go by. Sidney Smith tested hl3 toy pistol
peveral days ago and is likely to lose his
life in consequence. Eric Everson also
tried his toy gun and if proper attention
is not given him he will lose hi3 right
hand. W;; ; '
Doth cases came to the Harbor Hos
pital yesterday morning while Dr. Dray
was on watch. Sidney Smith is about
12 years old and his parents live at
COO Davis street. The lad was getting his
gun " ready for the celebration on tho
Fourth and in order to test the weapon
put a blank charge in. It went off and
the powder and wadding lodged in the
palm of his hand. Sidney concealed tho
wound from his parents and went about
the house as usual. The hand began to
fester and some simple remedies ' were
used.
Yesterday morning the boy went' into
convulsions and nothing gave him relief.
His muscles became rigid and his jaws
locked so that nothing could be passed
into his mouth. The Ha'rbor Hospital
was notified and In a short time th^ boy
was removed in the ambulance. Dr.
Dray found all the symptoms of tetanus
and used all the means at his disposal to
save the boy'a 'life. When the palm
of the hand was cut open a quantity of
powder and wadding was found imbedded
in the flesh. This was removed and as
the patient showed no signs of recovery
he was sent In a hurry to* the City and
County Hospital.
An hour after Sidney Smith had been
sent to the City and County Hospital.
Eric ErlcKson was brought in from US
Tchama street. The lad hal been play
ing with a toy pistol and an accidental
discharge sent the contents into the palm
of his right hand. Dr. Dray had another
hour's hard work in getting all the pow
der and wadding out of this hand. With
the memory of Sidney Smith's case in his
mind the physician sent a note to little
Eric's parents warning them to have a
physician attend to the hand as the
wound if not .properly treated might re
sult in death.
Alec Fraser will not make the great
showing on the Fourth that he expected,
lie' was training a monkey to represent
the Goddess of Liberty, in a pantomime
he was to give at the Adams House on
Sacramento street next- Wednesday. The
monkey objected to the dress and bit
Fraser in half a dozert places yesterday
morning. Hi3 wounds were dressed at the
Harbor Hospital.
Robert Anton, aged 11 years, yesterday
undertook to emulate General Shatter in
his famous Santiago battle. He loaded a
mlnature cannon with black powder and,
unlike the artillerymen, instead of pulling
the string at a safe distance he placed a
match to the vent. The discharge wa,s
entirely satisfactory so far as the cannon
was concerned, but unfortunately for the
hov his right hand was badly lacerated.
A trip to the City and County Hospital
followed, where the wounded member was
dressed, after which the young patriot
was taken by his mother to her residence
at 714 Potrero avenue.
John Banker, a Friendless Boy, Ar
rssted Because He Was Watch
ing the Game.
rollceman John II. Colen. whose record
for peculiar arrests is ahead of any other
m"mber of the department, atrain distin
guished himself yesterday by arresting an
Innocent boy on a charge of playing cru
soe. The boy has no friends in the city
and had to remain in the City Prison
among men charged with all sorts of of
fenses. Â¦ .;Â¦-
Several boys were playinp cruson on
William BtreetJ and Cole:'., who Js always
aching for an arrest, saw them. They all
ir.fcde their escape except John Banker,
a boy !â¢> years of Pge. who was looking
on at the came. He did not attempt to
run and Co!en grabbed him. He marched
him to the patrol box corner of Ellis
and Taylor streets and rang in for the
wagon. A crowd gathered and wondered
what desperate criminal Colen had
caught. The officer on the wagon was
astonished when he was told to book
th* 1 Jif.y for playing crusoe.
"I -was not playing crusoe," said John
nie, wh#Â»n pf-en in the prison. "I was sim
ply looking on at the other boys play,
and toirl the policeman so. but he insisted
on arresting me. I came from San Jose
hist nisht to try to set- a job. I used
to worn for Morton's special delivery in
this city. I have no friends to bail me
out and I suppose I will have to stay in
jail till to-morrow."

| SOLDIERS ON SUMNER
! ' . MAKE LOUD PROTEST
:
Claim That Quartermaster Underfed
Themâ Second Steward Will Sue
for Damages.
There is trouble brewing for Captain
Charles T. Baker, quartermaster of the
i luxuriously fitted transport Sumner, for
< his alleged ill treatment of Second Stew
1 ard W. fcL Clark on the voyage over from
i Manila. Clark was kept in the ship's
"brig" for eighteen days prior to the ar
rival of the Sumner in port and then
summarily dismissed from the service and
sent ashore, lie claims that he was im
prisoned without cause, and says that he
will sue Captain Baker for heavy dam
ages, and will preler charges against him
at Washington.
"The 110 discharged soldiers who came
over in the 'steeratre' of the palatial
transport are also talking of preferring
charges against Baker for alleged mis
treatment. The/ claim that they were
underfed and treated like cattle, where
as the oflicers lived on fri^d chicken and
all sorts of good things. Quartermaster-
Sergeant Kent, who seems to be leader
among the p->ldiers who came over in the
Sumner, declares that the food given to
the men. in addition to being scant, was
unnt to eat.
"Why." he said, "while there were over
100 of us. we received rations for about
forty. We spent over 51000 among us on
tho voyage for extra food. I know what
an arniy ration is. The regulations allow
l 4 i pouiius of meat ner day to each man.
but we were lucky to get half a pound of
ro'.ien mpat. I've been in Cuba and have
seen hard service In the Philippines, but
never was I served so badly by the com
missary as on this trip. Our repeated pro
tests to Captain Baker seemed to have
no effect on him whatever.
"Chief Steward Galloway was fired off
the ship at Nagasaki for trying to give us
a square deal, and when Second Steward
Clark tried it he was put in the brig and
kÂ«?pt there. I'm not a kicker, but I don't
like to be starved. That man Baker ought
to be thrown out of the service."
Stirring Sermon at Emanuel Evan
gelical Church by Rev. W. H.
Althouse.
The Rev. W. H. Althouse, pastor of the
Kmanuel Evangelical Church, delivered
the sermon at the morning service. He
took for the subject of his discourse
"Christ's Revelation to His Disciples." He
said in part:
"Christ spoke most comforting words
to his disciples before his death and de
parture. He directed their thoughts to
the fact that he would reveal himself to
them in a spiritual manner. That the
disciples thought was impossible. They
could not also understand how he could

SCHOONER MIZPAH REPORTED
SAFE IN MEXICAN PORT
She Arrived at Manzanillo on May
20 Last, Short of Provisions
and Water.
The Pacific Mail Company's steam
er Acapulco arrived from Panama
and way ports yesterday. Among 1
tho passengers was Captain Pear
son of the schooner Mizpah. This
vessel is now out 106 days from Punta
Arenas for San Francisco and The Call
had an exclusive account of her being
overdue in connection with the reinsur
ance on the Americana. At that time It
was pointed out that both vessels were
probably delayed by light and unfavor
able winds.
The Americana put into Honolulu on
June 14, short of provisions and water
and the Mizpah reached Manzanillo on
May 20 suffering from similar shortages.
Both vessels had almost the same kind
of weather and both of them will have
to receive considerable overhauling when
they reach San Francisco.
Captain Pearson left the Mizpah at
Manzanillo and came home on the Aca
pulco. Captain Sutherland, formerly of
the schooner Sophie Sutherland, is in com
mand, and will reach port in due time.
Captain Pearson says his vessel is all
right and nothing but urgent private bus
iness brought him home.
10:30 o'clock this morning In the Mission
Home of the Woman's Occidental Mis
sionary Board. 920 . Sacramento street.
The Rev. Father Yorke Preached on
the Importance of the
Day.
The feast of tne Apostles Saints Peter
and j Paul was celebrated in all the Cath
olic churches of the city yesterday. At
St. Ignatius Church the sermon in the
morning was preached by the Rev. Father
Chiappa. At St. Peter's Church solemn
high mass was celebrated at 10:30 o'clock.
The Rev. Father lorke preached the ser
mon and at the close of his discourse the
oenediction of the blessed sacrament was
pronounced.
At St. Mary's Church the altars were
beautifully decorated with red roses in
honor of the saint*. The evening sermon
was delivered by the Rev. Father
O'Keeffe. He said in part:
"Italy and Spain are the most romantic
countries in the world. The climate must
have something to do with it. The Italians
at their services in their old country like
florid music, and bright lights. The child
ren dance in front of the tabernacle. The
people of this country are more staid, yet
it is all one religion.
"The beautiful architectural buildings
of the church, the altars and fine singins
are mere outward forms. They are
shadows. But the Catholic faith never
changes. It was founded on a rock and
will last forever. Let us all strive for
heaven. The kingdom of heaven Is like a
net cast into the sea, and gathering in all
kinds of fishes."
At the close of hi3 sermon Father
O'Keeffe administered solemn benedic
tion.
SAINTS PETER AND PAUL
{ FEAST WAS CELEBRATED
THE Republicans of San Francisco have a solemn duty
to perform. They have shown In their reEistration In the
district clubs tbat they mean to take a part in the poli
tics of San Francisco, of the State and of the nation,
which means that the decent people of this city will insist
upon a representation of their rights in the administration
of local. State and National government. The struggle, how
ever, has just begun. The saloon -is quite as prominent a3
it ever was in local municipal affairs. The men who have
governed the city through the side entrance of a tenderloin
saloon are as prominent to-day as they were before the
thought of reform struck the people of SanFranciFco. These
men represent all that Is vicious in municipal affairs. They
represent the prostitution of municipal morality, the degra
dation of public men, the humiliation of citizens and the
story Of what San Francisco should not be in the eyes of
other cities in the State. Republicans have shown by their
enrollment in the district clubs that they mean to do their
duty to their party and to the State.
The struggle has just begun, and they must take their
part In the election ot officers and in the government of the
clubs of which they are members in order that misrule will
not cheat them out of the triumph of government for which
they are striving. Every Republican who has signed his
name to the roll of a district club has a right, as far as his
vote goes, to decide who shall be an officer of that club, and
the officers of every club will determine what the policy of
the Republican party In this campaign will be.
It Is, therefore, the duty of every Republican who has
signed a district roll to insist upon his privilege of having
a voice in party affairs. If this is done San Francisco will
have the unique experience of witnessing a body of men de
termined upon their right to have purity In public affairs
and insisting that they shall have a voice In the choice of
men who will represent them in municipal and other gov
ernment. They will demand that the blackguards who gov
ern slderoom saloons will not govern local Republican poli
tics.

REPUBLICANS OF SAN FRANCISCO
HAVE A SOLEMN DUTY TO PERFORM
Enrollment of Republican voters dur'ng
the week ended June 00 gave the betterele
meiits of the party the advantage. of num
bers enrolled in fourteen of Â».he eighteen
Assembly district clubs. According to the
plan adopted by the Republican County
Committce, under whose auspices the en
rollment was conducted, the rolls are to
be carefully inspected. Complaints of fraud
or unfairness in excluding qualified Re
publicans from enrollment, or in permit
ting stuffers to enroll, must be hoard by
the joint executive and advisory com
mittees of the Republican County Com
mittee. It is expected that members of
the committee will perform their duty to
the city and the party without the slight
est wavering.
There can be no compromise with Kelly
and Crimmins. The sooner the creatures
of bossism are placed in the background
the better it will be for the cause of
good government in fc-an Francisco. The
merchants, manufacturers, workingmen
and taxpayers can certainly apprt-ciate the
fact that the Republican party must b*
relied upon to protect the ousiness and
industrial interests of the city. In times
past disgusted and discouraged citizens
of Republican faith had the privilege of
appealing to the non-partisan elements or
to the Uemocratie party for relief when
their own party seemed to be dominated
by boss influence.
Conditions have changed. The primary
election law practically removes the non
partisan element from the political stage.
Events since the election of Phelan have
demonstrated beyond all doubt that gov
ernment under the Bubonic Democratic
party will depreciate the value of prop
erty, drive our commerce to other cities,
bankrupt our merchants and impoverish
our workingmen.
The Republican party is the only agency
of good government available, hence the
merchants, laboring men and property
owners cannot afford to allow bosses o'f
the Crimmins-Kelly tvpe to control the
clubs and dictate the nominations. Every
citizen of ordinary intelligence knows that
Phil Crimmins and Martin Kelly are as
destitute of patriotism as they are of de
cency. They do not care a nickel whether
McKinley or Bryan be elected President.
They are reaching out to get a hold on the
party organization in order to send some
apc-nt of corruption to the Legislature.
State Senators are to be elected who will
hold over and vote for a United States Sen
ator to succeed George C. Perkins. The
depraved bosses expect to make mer
chandise of votes in the Legislature.. They
are plotting and scheming in the' dark,
while honest men of the party arc work
ing for a livelihood in the legitimate fields
of industry.
Pinhead politicians who talk of surren
dering: principle for harmony argue that
since no municipal offices are to be filled
next November th*> bosses cannot hurt thu
city in this campaign. This is the proper
time to fight apents of corruption in local
affairs and drive "them out of political
business. The State Central Committee
the Congressional committees and the
county committees should represent in the
fullest sense the law-abldinj- and self-re
specting citizens of the Republican party.
Five thousand San Francisco voters of
non-partisan tendency will be added to
the Republican strength next November
if the Republican County Committee shall
stand firm and uncompromisinfr in its de
termination to emancipate the local or
ganization from every vestige of Kelly
and Crimmins domination.

A POPULAR MISTAKE v
Regarding Hencdies for Dyspepsia
and Indigestion-
Thf r.atlor.al <"i?easp of Americans Is ln-
or ln its chronic form dyspepsia,
ard tot the very reason that it i? so com-
mon many people neglect taking proper
treatment for what they consider trifling
Rtomacb trouble, when as a matter of
fact indigestion lay? the foundation for
many Incurable diseases. Xo person with
Â¦ i-iirr>rouÂ«=. healthy stomach will fall a
.ictJrn to consumption. Many kidney dJs-
r-asps and heart troubles date their begJn-
r.ir.jr from poor dipeFtion; thin, nervous
people are really so because their Ftom-
F.ehs are out of gear; weary, languid,
faded out women owe their condition to
Imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you meet ls
evicted with weak digestion it Is not sur-
prlFlnp That nearly everj* secret patent
medicine on the market claims to be a cure
for dyspepsia, as well as a score of other
-rouble?, when ln fact, as Dr. Werthier
f-sys, there is but one Â«*-enuine dyspepsia
cure v.-hich is perfectly safe and reliable,
p.r.<i. moreover, this remedy is not a patent
medicine, but it is a scientific combination
Ot pure peps'.n <free from animal matter),
vfjretable essences, fruit salt? and bis-
rr;:h. It is sold by drugeists under name
of Stuart> Dyspepsia Tablets. N*o ex-
travatesnt claims are made for them, but
for indigesticn or any stomach trouble
F: :axt's Dyspepsia Tablets are far ahead
ot ar.y remedy yet discovered. They act
aa Th<-" food eaten, no dieting is necessary,
f'.rrply eat Ell the wholesome food you
want and these tablets will digest it. A
fjre results, because all the stomach
needs Is a rest, which Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets jdve by doing the work of diges-
tion. '

ALAMEDA CRICKETERS WIN
FROM SANTA CRUZ TEAM
Oakland 1, Sacramento 0.
A very fine, article of baseball was pre
sented yesterday afternoon by the Oak
land and Sacramento teams. In which the
former was successful by the very close
score cf 1 to 0. The principal feature of
tho game was the phenomenal pitching of
BorchPrs, who struck five men out and
off whom there were but t\vo base hits
made. Doyla pitched in fine style also,
only three base hits being registered
against him. The pitchers were ably sup
ported by Mangerina and Eagar, their
respective catchers.
The first base hit off Doyle came In the
peventh inning, with two men out. "Dr."
Moskiman succeeded in reaching the In
itial bas, afterward stealing second and
scoring on Mangerlna's two-base hit. In
this inning "Truck" Eagan distinguished
himself by retiring three men at first
Ihrougn rapid assists.
The first inning promised well for Oak
land. With three men on basesâ Francks
at flm. Hardie at second and Lange at
thirdâ three balls were called on Moski
man, and it looked as if the first run for
the Dudes would be forced in. Doyle,
however, ser" a "beauty" over the plate,
which the "Doctor" could not resist, and
Stulz blasted Oakland's hopes and those
of Lange by throwing the last named out.
In the ninth the Senators went In to do
or die, but they did the. latter. Eagan
went out on a high foul to Hutchinson.
Hanlon struck out and Eagan reached
Erst on Franck's fumble. Doyle fouled to
Mangerina. The tale is told.

porarily deserted third base for the pitch

STOCKTON, July l.-Stockton rested to
day. Daybreak put an end to the scenes
of revelry, such scenes as the staid old
Mill City never before witnessed. After
the crowds thinned out, and this was not
till 1 o'clock, maskers took possession of
the streets. Their deportment was bois
terous but not so violent as to call for
the intereference of the authorities. So
far as Is known no unpleasant conse
quences resulted from the reign of the
King Pin. While there are one or two
exhibitions on the Midway that may fall
under condemnation of the people, they
seem content to leave the prerogative of
censorship to the authorities.
The executive committee rinds the re
ceipts for the first half of the street fair
to be highly satisfactory, and witn two
big days yet on the programme it i3 an
ticipated that all expenses will be met in
full, obviating the necessity of drawing
on the guarantee fund, and leaving to the
credit of the business community a week
of Unprecedented activity. The grand
stand was opened this evening and a band
concert given. Nothing but sacred music
was rendered. The attendance was very
fair when the exhausted condition of the
people is taken into consideration. For
those desiring other entertainment , there
was an excuision uown tne tianta Fe, the
ball game at Goodwater Grove and var
ious recreations at the out of town re
sorts.
To-morrow may be fittingly termed wo
man's day. The baby show and the baby
coach parade have been the subjects of
much preparation. The ribbon parade at
4 o'clock will be an affair of spectacular
beauty. There will be a number of turn
outs from Sacramento. Lodl and neigh
boring places. If all who have signified
their Intention of participating are on
hand the procession will prove one of the
features of the fair.
The idea of the "ribbon" parade is to
have ribbons substituted for flowers as
decorations for the vehicles. Ov.-lr.j; to
the lateness of the season it was thought
that there would not be enough flowers
obtainable. Excursions from both the
north and south are expected.
Receipts of the Fair So Far Highly-
Satisfactory and It Is Believed
All Expenses "Will Be Met
in Full.

An entry in the diary of June 8 tells of
the drowning of a party of four, one
woman and throe men. May 15 on the
Yukon ten miles below the mouth of
Forty-Mile. The some day the. diary re
lates that four othrrs were drowned from
a boat a few miles further down.
A diary found on Pavey gave informa
tion relative to the expedition, which left
Dawson May 14. On that date he and Mc-
I-'arron and Thomas McFaiiden left Daw
Â£on in a small doat. At Circle City Me-
Fadden refused to go further on account
of the treacherous state of the Yukon
ice. Pavey and McKarron. being unable
to handle the craft, abandoned it and
later took passage on the sloop Seattle,
which contained five passengers. The
names of two Adair and Wallace, are
mentioned in the diary.
Three other known occupants of the
sloop, all of whom are missing, were Neil
Adair and Frank Alger, both of Seattle,
and a man named J. McFarron. A Mr.
Wallace is suppos*Â»d to have been a fourth
member of the party.
The body of A. Pavey. one of the party
in the sloop, washed ashore twelve miles

Whig Mistakes.
At the close of the war with Mexico the
Whig party was in a favorable position for
a series of national triumphs. Democratic
leaders had inaugurated a war which vio
lated the better conscience of the nation
for the purpose of securing an increased
area for slavery. They had indeed se
cured Texas &e a slave State, but along
with Texas a vast territory had been ac
quired from which slavery was legally ex
cluded, end into which It seemed Impos
sible that it should be introduced. From
nearly all other territory slavery had been
excluded by the Missouri compromise. It
In ISOO the Whig party had been faithful
to the leadership of the Whig President,
and had refused to enter into any com
promise- which was fitted to help the Dem
ocrats out of their political dilemma, it
would naturally have drawn to itself the
anti-slavery sentiment of the North and
the union sentiment of the South. It would
.have continued to be a great national
party with enduring triumphant issues.
But in an evil hour certain Whig lead
ers, notably Henry Clay and Daniel Web
ster, threw themselves in opposition to the
Whig administration and brought forward
a series of compromises which were fitted
to remove from pro-slavery Democrats
the odium which they had brought upon
themselves. In the face of Whig opposi
tion the Democrats had carried the cour,
try into H war, with the Intention, as was
believed, of acquiring more slave terri
tory. Along with the added slave terri
tory they had gained free territory. Had
the Whigs been wise they would not havt
raised the question of extending .slavery
Into the free territory. The Whig com
promise act legalized slavery in the ac
quired territory in case the prople should
desire it when they applied for admission
as States. The Whig compromise also pro-
I vided for a fugitive slave law. which was
I so drawn as to be an offense to the great
body of the northern people.
By the compromise measures the Whigs
lost the support of northern anti-slavery
citizens, while they gained no support
from the South. Kverywhere the people
asked what the Whig party meant. Web
ster and the promoters of the compromise
answered this question by saying that the
party stood for tne Union and the com
promises. But the Democrats could say
with even greater fervor that they also
stood for the Union and the compromises.
The compromises served to unite the.
Democratic party. The Free Soilers, who
had separated from the Democrats in
1S4S, returned to the fold on the basis ot
the Whig compromise. There was noth
ing distinctive for which the Whigs stood.
In the platform of 1S52 the Whigs natur
ally felt impelled to approve of the com
promts-s. The Democrats also approved
of the compromises, and with great ex
plicitness named the fugitive slave act as
a measure to be sacredly observed and
faithfully executed. Then the question re
mained unanswered, what did the \\ hig
party stand for? It seemed to stand for
precisely the same thing which the Demo
cratic party represented, A political party
in the American system is expected to dis
cover, criticize and oppose the erroneous
policy of another political party. It Is a
primary duty of one party to hold the
opposing party to the responsibility of its
own acta.
Under the leadership of a Southern
slaveholder the Whigs had a great op
portunity to secure a permanent settle
ment of the whole question of the exten
sion of slavery into new territory, and to
accomplish this it was not necessary for
them to do anything but simply to leave
the territory as the Democrats left It.
Undoubtedly some Whigs were afraid that
the Union would be disrupted. President
Taylor, who knew the South well, had no
more fear on that subject than had Pres
ident Jackson eighteen years before. In
any event the way to save the Union was
for the Whig party, as a great national
organ, to hold its place. Of course, the
Whigs who were responsible for the com
promise did not understand what they
were doingâ they did not know that they
were destroying their party. The Demo
crats however, were not slow to under
stand* the nature of the act. All that was
necessary for the Democrats to do In order
to gain an easy triumph over the Whigs
was simply to hold the Whigs firmly to
the responsibility of their ownÂ«acts. The
Wbies nave enacted the compromise, now
let them stand by it. Especially let them
stand by the fugitive slave act!
During the campaign the Democrats
were united and hopeful, while the Whigs
were divided and despondent. In the na
tional Whic convention there was lack of
unity as to the platform; a considerable
minority voted against the clause express
ing approval of the fugitive slave law.
The platform, however, was In this re
spect made acceptable to the Southern
members. These gave almost their entire
support to Millard Fillmore as the candi
date for the Presidency, while Winfleld
Scott received the votes of all who were
opposed to committing the Whig party to
the sanction of the fugitive slave law.
Daniel Webster was the favorite of
twenty-nine delegates, mostly from New
England. In the final result the South
got the platform and the North got the
candidate. Scott was a Virginian by birth,
and was nominated on account of his
military career. Several of the leading
Whigs in the South openly repudiated the
candidate on the ground of his alleged
free-soil tendencies. On the part of the
Whigs it was a lifeless campaign and in
the outcome only four State.-*â \ ermont.
Massachusetts. Kentucky and Tennessee
chose Whic electors. This proved to be
the last important Whig campaign.
The End of an Bra.
The passing of the Whig party coincided
with the passing of great statesmen and
former leaders. While tho Whig conven
tion was in session in Baltimore, in June
1852, Henry Clay was dying in Washington.
No one had in all respects so thoroughly
personated and represented the party as
he. Twice its standard-bearer; always in
the minds of the people: a candidate for
the Presidency, he had a personal follow
ing such a* few men have enjoyed. Daniel
Webster also hoped, and indeed expected,
to be made the candidate of the party.
He had been voted for for President, but
he had never received the regular nomi
nation of hi3 party. Twice, it Is alleged,
he might have had the nomination for the
Vice Presidency, and in each case, had he
accepted, he would have become President
through a vacancy In that office caused by
death. Webster died in the midst of the
campaign. It is one of the remarkable
coincidences of history that so large a
number of statesmen who. as young men.
had beeun to exercise a guidance in na
tional politics in the early decades of the
century should all at once leave the bur
den of sUntcPinanship to a younger genera
tion. Uesiriefr' Clay and Webster, there
was John Qulncy Adams, who <lietl at his
post two years earlier. John C. Calhoun
died a llttlfi Inter then Adams; Thomas
H. Benton left the Senate, never to return;
old hands rave place to new ones under
new and greatly changed conditions.
The Slavery Question as a Hindrance.
' Had the war of secession been fought
under the leadership of President Taylor
in 1S30 it would have b*en brief and prob-
Hbly tt would have been entirely blood
leas and it would have left the Union par
ty permanently ascendant. South as well
as North. Slavery would have been con
fined to its present limits and removed
from a dominant place in national poli
tics and the great Whig party, as the
party expressing Union sentiment and na'
tlonal aspiration, would have disputed
authority with the Democrats, who stood
for the principles of free trade, personal
liberty and local autonomy. The parties
would have been divided along the old
lines of real or supposed conflict in in
dustrial interests. And if ever there was
a time when a nation needed to have all
its political energies directed to the in
dustrial Interests of the whol* prople tt
was the I'nited States of America from
1S50 to XS70. During this period the rail
way, as a great national institution, was
created; during this period X? telegraph

and the dally paper became an Integral
part of the national life. It was during
this period that business corporations, or
ganized for the purpose of private gain,
got possession of the resources of th<Â»
country. The foundation was laid for our
most serious industria 1 problems during
the period when the attention of the peo
ple was monopolized with the question of
the preservation of the Union. It would
have been an easy matter to deal with the
railway problem and allied monopolistic
enterprises before the Civil War. But af
ter twenty years of neglect and after an
other twenty years occupied with the con
sideration of special problems which the
the war created satisfactory control
seems almost hoDeles*.
At the time of the passing of the "Whigs
the tariff question s-eemed to have reached!
a permanent settlement. The Democratic
tariff of 1S45 was in force. It was a mod
erately protective measure. Had politics
gone on in its natural course the Whigs,
as traditionally favorable tr> the policy of
protection, would have resisted further
advances in the direction of free trade,
while the Democrats would have contend
ed for progressive advancement in that
direction. But It was a time when the
shipping interests of the country were as
suming vast proportions. The Improve
ment of rivers and harbors by the nation
al Government could not longer be de
layed and the Whigs were naturally In a
position thus to exalt the importance of
the Union. Public improvements In th*
hands of the separate States hart been
proved Inadequate. The Clayton-Bulwer
treaty had just been signed and there was
a peneral expectation that there would bÂ»
a Nicaragua canal In a few years. Both
external and internal commerce demand
ed the guiding hand of a vigorous national
Government. When the party system
failed the people were left without tha
means of controlling their national affairs.
They became victims to sectional strife,
misunderstanding and hatred. Parties
were formed on sectional lines and tha
nation was transformed into warring sec
tions.
The Whig party mlsrht have recovered
after the crushing defeat of 1STC but It
did not. A Knownothlng party, organized
first as a secret society, spread all over
the country. North and South. The Whigs
did, indeed, bring out a ticket four years
later, in ISoo. and made Mlilard Flllmora
their candidate. Filltnore was likewise
the candidate of the Southern Knownoth
lng party, and as representing the two.
parties combined he carried the singl*
State of Maryland. There was again a
feeble effort to revive the party in 1S00,
but It was of no avail.

The unfortunate man was crossing the
track at the junction of Cedar and At

dence at 17^7 Atlantic street to go to the
roundhouse where he was employed as an
ensine-cleaner.
Allen was very familiar with the cross
ing, as lie passed there several times a
day. The Alameda train runs on cannon
bail time through the railroad yards, and
many fatalities have occurred along the
track? there, because engineers have been
unable to stop the swiftly moving trains
in time to save a life. It was so in Allen's
case. The train had struck him before he
knew it was near him. The workman was
hurled twenty f'^ct. His body was badly
bruised, one iep was broken and his head
was terribly crushed. As soon as the
train was stepped assistance was at hand,
but Allen breathed his last before any one
reached his mangled body. The Coroner
was called and had the remains removed
to the Morgue, where an inquest will be
held to-morrow evening. The train was
in charge of Kngineer Reynolds and Con
ductor Murphy.
Allen was a native of Austria. 49 years
old. He leaves a wife and live children.

ThP contest between Tamalpais Camp
and Western Addition Camp Is still going
on. This is a contest as to which camp
in a given time shall add the greatest
number of strangers to its membership
roll. The indications are that when the
contest it; over the treasury of one of the
camps will suffer, for the losing camp will
havo to banquet the new neighbors as well
as those who introduced the strangers
Into the forests of woodcraft. Tamalpais
is doing its best not to pay the banguet
bill, but finds that it has a strong op
ponent In Western Addition Camp.
Tamalpais Camp has started a social
fund, and when the membership shall
have reached 150 a stated amount shall
be taken out of the general fund monthly
and transferred to the social. Under thia
rule the camp will be enabled to have a
first-class entertainment every month.
Tamalpais Camp at Its meeting last
Monday nisht Initiated six candidates,
three of those being- members of the po
lice department. The third degree was
conferred on one of the latter In a manner
that excited the Interest of his fellow star
wearers in watching him ride the fraternal
ax, which Ip "the goat of the Woodmen."
The committee having charge of the pub
lic Installation of the new officers of the
camp to-morrow night has a surprise on
its programme that will keep its friends
guessing until the joker Is produced.
Golden Gate Camp of the Woodmen of
the World, the largest of the local camps.
Is still actively at work adding to Its mem
bership on every initiation night. It Is the
banner camp of San Francisco, and the
membership proposes to hold the banner.
The new officers soon to be Installed pro
pose to keep up the good work of the
term that is passing.

LADY Frahncis Hope is the guest of. Edna Wallace Hopper at the Duns
muir place at San Leandro. â¢
Lady Frahncis Hope is- hiding away in that sylvan retreat from the
prying, everyday, ordinary* world that has a curious desire to know
how folks with handles to .their names pass their time and spend their
money. But Lady Hope won't tell the Fecrets of the world she has married
into, and Edna Wallace Hopper conveyed to the waiting scribe her ladyship's
refusal to be interviewed. ;
" ItS P erfectlv terrible." said the little woman, who parades in tights in
the winter time and entertains house parties in the summer, "it's perfectly ter
rible that this has happened. That Lady Frahncis should be annoyed while
she is a guest in my house! I asked her down for a quiet day in the coun
try, and now this has happened. Just imagine my position. I'm her hostess!
How can I ever explain this away. She'll never come to me again, I'm sure."
The thought that perhaps the erstwhile Idol of the London "Johnnies"
might never more accept the attentions of the burlesque actress upset Mrs.
Hopper completely.
'.'This is awful! This is an imposition. Imagine my position!" She kept
repeating over and over again.
And truly it must have been rough on the daughter of Wally Wallace to
come face to face with a newspaper representative. Wallace was a struggling
scribe himself. Baseball reporter, lawyer's' clerk and chief usher at the old
California Theater were the titles he was entitled to. and they explain how
he managed to keepvhis little family together and educate little Edna. And
now Edna has grown to womanhood and has troubles of her own. not the least
of which, is "turning down" reporters when they would speak with titled
ladles who. come to her for a "quiet day in tho country."
S Out on a lawn, laid out like a "prop" wood, even to incandescent lights for
ladies who would hold the center of the stage, Lady "Frahncis" waited for
her hostess. . â¢ 'â
There Is a whole lot to Lady Hopeâ more than can t>e concealed with a
Ehort golf skirtâ and it does not take an X-ray eye to discover the form
divine that brought the "Johnnies" to the Yohe feet. But these same feetâ if
Mrs. Hopper had only permitted itâ Lady "Frahncis" might have told whether
or no she was born in Chicago.
; But did her ladyship have a ''quiet day"?. Most probably! There was a
bunch of men at the place to look after the comfort of the two ladles, and be
neath huge Japanese umbrellas sprinted about the lawn. There was any num
ber of Inviting round tables. Oh yes, she probably had "a quiet day In the
country-" Â¦ ~> -Â¦ w . / 4T-. Â¦<Â¦ *

SUICIDE'S BODY LAY
UNDISCOVERED A DAY
Frank W. Bennett Shoots Himself
in tHe Head While Occupying
a House Alone.
Frank W. Bennett, aged thirty-six, com
mitted suicide by shooting himself in the
head some time Saturday night in his
room at 673 Shrader street. The landlady
of the house was out of town and did not
return till late lasrnight. She visited Ben
nett's room, and found his body stretched
upon the bed. He must have* been dead at
least twenty-four hours.
The landlady immediately notified the
brother of the deceased. Dr. B. Gates
Bennett of Van Ness avenue, of the case
and he notified the Coroner. The suicide
was formerly a cigars drummer In this
city, but had been out of employment for
some time. . "
Bennett received remittances occasion
ally from wealthy relatives in New York,
and when he had the money spent it with
a liberal hand. He had once before at
tempten suicide at nhe residence of his
brother. The body was removed to the
Morgue.
a tutor apparently . thoroughly adapted
to . his task. The properties, and means
to the end are the usual "behind the
scenes" arrangements, chorus ladles and
wine suppers, and the whole idea is revolt
ing to a degree. Songs and specialties all
lend themselves to the disagreeable sug
gest iveness, with the single exception of
Miss Louise Gunning's Scotch carols,
which come like a breath of clear air
through the reek of patchouli and musk.
"A Day and a Night" Is, of course, well
acted by the Dunne and Ryley people, un
pleasantly well done, and all the stars
appeared. The new leading lady. Miss
Norma Whalley, was heard in a pong and
achieved much success. She is very cood
to look upon.
To-r.ijjht the new Frawley company will
make its first appearance at the Grand
Opera-house In Zangwill's "Children of
the Ghetto," with Wilton Lackaye as
Reh Shemuel, which part he created in
New York. Rosabel Morrison will also
be seen as Hannah Jacobs, which she
p!aye<l in the New York and London pro
ductions, and a notable cast will take
care of the remaining characters. The
play will be well mounted and costumed,
and the advance sale of seats indicates
a wide interest in the new Frawley com
pany and "The Children of the Ghetto."
At the Columbia Theater to-night will
be given R. C. Carton's powerful play
"The Tree of Knowledge with a cast
rarely equaled in excellence. Henry Mil
ler. E. J. Morgan. Frank Worthing,
Charles Wolcot, John Findlay, E. J.
Backus. Margaret Anglin. Sadie Mar
tinet, Mrs. Thomas Whiffen and Lillian
Thurgate are names to charm with, and
they will all appear to-night. Next,' "A
Marriage of Convenience."
The Tivoli Opera-house has another big
winner with the pretty comic opera "The
Geisha." which to-night enters on its
second successful week. Every member
of the cast helps in a material manner to
the success of the play, while the chorus
and orchestra are distinct features of the
presentation. "The Geisha" will be fol
lowed by a short revival of "Wang" be
fore, the grand opera season begins, on
July 30.
Erma Wing, a talented soprano, will
make her first appearance at Fischer's
Concert House* to-night, singing Juliet to
Isabelle I'nderwood's Romeo and 'Signor
Abramoff's Friar Laurence in the mar
riage scene from Gounod's "Romeo and
Juliet." Deets and Don. clever singers
and dancers, and Master Xorman Phillips,
a Shakesperean reader, v/ill also be new,

hatic dancers, will reappear. Edison's
projectoscope will show the latest Afro-
English war scenes.
rank and file bourbon was spread over
the waters of the dock, while the soldiers
on the bow of the ship shook their fists
in anger and the man who owned the
stuff looked miserable.
It appears as if the. men on the Grant
are going to lose money on the trip to
China. The act of May 2C la.st allows offi
cers 10 per cent and enlisted men 20 per
cent additional for service in the Philip
pines. Hawaii and Cuba and Porto. Rico
and Alaska, in addition to their regular
pay. In the case of officers and. men or
dered to China this act will not hold good
and the old schedule will remain in force.
The Comptroller of the Treasury has been
asked by the War Department to Inter
pret the law with special reference to the
troops ordered to China. .
About 2 p. m. the Loelanaw got under
way. Half an hour later she was followed
by the Conemaugh. A prescribed course
has been set down, and when the Grant
sails early this morning she w^jl follow
it and will find her consorts about 500
miles from the Golden Gate. The three
vessels will probably make the run to
Nagasaki in sixteen days and then If the
trouble is still brewing in China they will
proceed to Hongkong. If the Boxers have
been suppressed and there to no need for
troops the Grant, Conemaugh and Lee
lanaw will proceed to Manila.
that the reason for the return of the
Grant was that General Chaffee had re
ceived a telegram from Washington,
which was sent after the Grant on the
Fearless. The Grant is said to have been
proceeding under half steam when the
tug overtook her.
Sailing- Delayed.
The transports Grant. Conemaugh and
Leelenaw were to .have sailed for
China via Nagasaki at noon yester
day, but owing the the non-arrival
of General Chaffee from the East their
departure was delayed. The two ships
last mentioned got away early In the af
ternoon, however, their commanders not
waiting for the general's arrival.
The Grant carries the Sixth Cavalry
and about 224 marines, while the Cone
maugh and Lieelanaw carry horses and
supplies for the men. The marines eamÂ«
from the East, one section from the Xc*w
York navy-yard and the other from the
marine barracks at Washington. On
their arrival here they went aboard the
transport. It was the original intention
to send the men to the Philippines, but
when the trouble broke out in China their
destination was changed.
The officers in command of tho naval
contingent are: Ma .lor W. P. Biddle, com
manding; Captain F. J. Moses and W. C.
0.^ tne second anniversary of his
\ famous victory at El Caney. Major
General Adna R. Chaffee, U. S. V..
failed last n!ght on the transport
Grant for China, whf-re he will take com
mand of the American troopa now gather
ing at Taku to march to the relief of the
diplomatic corps In Peking. Unfortunate
ly, the Grant was compelled to return to
port when but a few miles outside the
J-.eads because of a defective pteamplpe in
the cnpir.e-room, and It is possible that
Fhe may not be able to get under way
aprain before midday.
General Chaffee arrived from the East
en the ovrrland train about 6:30 p. m., ac
companic-d only by his aid. Lieutenant
Harper. So urgent is the demand for his
Immediate departure that one of General
Fhafi'-r's staff officers met him at Sacra
mento with the dispatches containing his
tiral instructions. When the train reached
the Oakland mole the tup Fearless was
waiting to tnk" the famous fighting gen
eral direct to the transport Grant, which
had already tripped her anchors and was
ttearr.inc slowly down the bay.
General Shatter and a number of army
officers greeted General Chaffee as he
stepped from the train and accomjianied
him to the side of the transport. There
was n<Â» delay. As soon as the general and
his aid had been helped aboard the Fear
ioss cut loose and Captain Bufortl gave
ihe signal for full speed ahead. As the
Grant stfamed past the forts the batteries
tired a salute.
Came as a Surprise.
General ChafCee accepted the China com
mand very much against his personal
wishes. It came as a complete surprise to
him. but being a soldier he did not de
mur. The penoral was at his home at
Liitchfield. Conn., when he received a tele
pram from the Secretary of "War. on the
22d lnst., asking him to come to Utica. N.
Y., at once. There on the following day
he met Secretary Root and proceeded with
him to WaFhinsrton. where the offer of thÂ»
China, command was accepted by General
<'hHffee, who returned ;it once to his home
for a day to prepare for the journey. On
Tuesday niRht he aprain. returned to Wash
ington and on the following morning set
out for this city.
General Chaftee did not care last night
to dj^cuF? his plans.
"I really have nothing to say," was his
reply to a Call representative's question.

Xeville: Second Lieutenants D. W. Blake,
C. C. Carpenter, AV. P. llarlee, John G.
Mulr and S. A. W. Patterson.
The cavalry and about 400 recruits and
casuals marched in from the Presidio yes
terday morning, and soon after they got
aboard the Grant the vessel was taken
out into the stream and anchored near
the Conemaugh and Leelanaw.
"Whisky Is Lost.
The transport wharf has never shown
a busier scene since the first rush of
troops to the Philippines began. Many
of the soldiers made their escape and a
corporal's, guard had to round them up.
A number of attempts were made to
smuggle whiskv aboard, but nearly all of
thorn failed. One man Tame along with
a five-gallon demijohn and attempted to
pass it up over the bow of the ship. The
soldiers passed down a "heaving line" and
to it the demijohn was made fast. It
was then dropped into the water and was
being hauled aboard when Gatekeeper
and Special Policeman Wheeler appeareu
on the scene. His time to act was very
short, as the demijohn was up to the
hawse pipe and another haul on the

"My orders were handed to me only a few
hours ago at Sacramento, and I have not
had a chance to read them. My journey
has been made very quickly and there
was no time for me to receix'e anything
more, than general instructions before 1
left "Washington."
The time has been so brief that Genera!
Chaffe> has not even had a staff as
signed to him. He will have to make up
his staff from regimental officers al
ready on the field or now on the way.
Military men consider this a very great
handicap, for a good staff is essential to
success. It i3 customary for a general to
select his own staff officers from men
whom he has tried and whose ability is
known to him personally.
Grant Eeturas to Port.
The Grant returned to port about 10
o'clock and anchored off Folsom street.
An officer who came ashore In a launch
stated that the clause of delay was the
discovery that the branch steam pipe to
the starboard engine was loose and in
danger of blowing out. The defect Â¦was
not discovered until the transport Â¦was
well outside and rolling in the heavy
swell. The defective pipe was brought
ashore last night, and will be repaired
with all possible speed.
It â¢was reported along the water front
The deciding course in the big stake at
Union Coursing Park was not run yester
day, as F. A. McComb's Sir Pasha, one of
the greyhounds eligible to compete with
Curtis &. Sens' Candelaria, had just won
a tremendous course from Curtis & Sons'
Luxor. They met in the S3mi-flnal round
and ran an undecided course, each scoring
four points on a hare which led them clean
across the field. Luxor showed the speed
and secured the first two turns, his op
ponent then scoring two turns and the kill.
They were allowed a rest while another
brace of dogs were being coursed, and
were then slipped to a Hying hare, which
upset all calculations of the bettors. Lux
or was the first to show and quickly
scored four points. Sir Pasha then took
possession and ran up a number of points,
Luxor being at his s:de all the time. The
hare fell once and it was thought the
course was at an end, but she jumped up,
apparently stronger than ever. At no time
after that could the two fast dogs touch
the hare. After running two minutes the
relief dog was liberated and soon caught
the hare. For some reason the latter waj
not killed by the dogs, and when their
handlers took them up the hare trotted off
the field. The course ends the instant a
relief dog joins in. AVhen this occurred
yesterday Luxor had possession of the
hare, but was beaten by a score of 13 to
12. Had the course lasted but a few mo
ments more he would undoubtedly have
scored again and made it either an unde
cided course or else would have turned
defeat into victory.
Both dogs were distressed and were
Riven skillful handling aftery the course.
Sir Pasha was carried off the field by
Frank JlcComb, who was cheered wildly
by the spectators. As the young dog
could make no showing in the deciding
course after such desperate going he was
withdrawn, and first inonev went to Cur
tis & Sons' Candelaria by default.
There was a noticeable increase in the
attendance, caused by the temporary clos
ing down of Ingleside Coursing Park. The
coursing throughout the day was of the
highest class, the outcome of the stake
being in doubt up to the last minute.
There were but few false favorites. Hot
Haste was one of them, being defeated by
Wild Norah at odds of 7 to 1. Erin beat
Cavalier at 2Vi "to 1. Bir Pasha beat "War
ship at 2 to 1, Greenhall beat Spiteful at

Eugene Geary's champion. Palo Alto,
was as unlucky as Luxor, with whom he
shared stake favoritism. On Saturday
he had a severe course of one minute, and
yesterday In his first course he ran for
two minutes with Old Glory. He won one
more course, defeating: Rest Assured, and
Â¦was then retired by Sara. The detailed
