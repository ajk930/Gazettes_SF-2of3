the delegates at large, the Hawaiian dele

tion proceeded to the convention it sang
its new California campaign song and re
ceived a general round, of applause for
the effort. . '; Â¦
The banners of the two delegations at
tracted wide attention. They are by all
odds the handsomest banners here, and
are always surrounded by admiring
throngs, and one hears ' remarks on all
sides such as "California always does
things up in- shape," "What a .line ban

Mayor Pholan's failure to walk with the
delegation to-day has added more fuel to
the fire of discontent that has arisen
against him In the delegation. It Is. said
that he has held himself somewhat aloof
from the others ever since starting, and,
while the delegates say nothing about it
openly, it Is plain to be seen that they are
not at all pleased with his conduct. .
It is surprising to note the number of
Californians that are here. One meets
them- at every. corner, and .this morning
Mr. Tarpey, the National Commltteeman,

CALL HEADQUARTERS KANSAS
CITY, July 4.â The California delegation
attended the convention in a body to-day.
A call had beenlsVued for them to as
semble at 10:45, and when that hour ar
rived all 'were present except Mayor Pho
lan. The Hawaiian delegation,' which had
teen invited to accompany the Californ
lans, was prompt in its arrival, and;to
gether they started for the great con
vention hall. First came . the beautiful
banner of the Callfornians, followed im
mediately by that of the Hawallans. Then
Glen, was chosen secretary thereof by ac
clamation. In fact, he probably could
have been chosen as chairman; but the
successful candidate. Judge Edward Gray
of Texas, and Freemann arc old friends
so they got together and Freemann took
the secretaryship. In the Clark contest
from # Montana, which was a very bitter
one, Freemann made a strong speech
against the seating of Clark, but the
ousted Senator was too strong and won
by a vote of S3 to 13. Members of the
New York delegation called on the Cali
fornians at their headquarters in tho
Coates House this afternoon to solicit
their support for John W. Kellar, New
.York's- candidate for Vice President. In
New York's delegation were CongressmaT
McClellan and State Senator Thomas F
Grady. They put Kellar's candidacy in
a -.serious light. Mayor Phelan and Del^>
?ate Denman interrogated them about
Cellar's personality and becullarquallflca
tions fos the exalted office of Vice Presi
dent. No reference was made to Mr. Kel

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. KANSAS CITY. Mo.. July 4.â The ground swell
was felt this morning. It was apparent that David B. Hill bad not been In
active during the night. Messengers were running to the delegations who
favored a reindorsement of the Chicago platform without a specific
free silver plank. Mr. Hill was tpr> wise to make such an effort. Reynard,
however, works more cautiously than' the Hon. While it was impossible to sud
denly concentrate the opposition it vras easy to await opportunities. That such
would be offered in the convention was fondly hoped. The convention Itself was
called to order at 12 o'clock. For an hour the deleeratlons had been dribbling
into the hall until the vast building was .packed. The platform ran into the
center of the hal! like a promontory into the sea.
The pit for the delegates was in the shape of a half moon with the curve on
the outside. Back of it was the gallery ten feet high following the curve of
the pit. It was draped with American colors, and had eight rows of seats ar
ranged like' seats In. an amphitheater Above this circle wa3 the second gallery,
also festooned with red, white and blue.. Away above all and fully fifty feet
above the head3 of the delegates pnd guests was a third gallery covered with
arms of. States, and beneath another bewildering display of colors in the way
of bannerets and streamers. The New Tork delegates were seated to the left ot
the platform occupied by the presiding officers and well In front. California
was well to the front and left. The Pennsylvania delegation filled the scats on the
speaker's right.
The first prominent delegation to arrive was that of Kentucky, headed by JoÂ«
? Blackburn and ex-Governor McCreary. Blackburn wore Kentucky tow, and Mc
* Creary resembled a well fed Episcopalian bishop. They found their way to
seats near the Pennsylvania delegation. Not long afterward the Virginia dele
gation appeared, with Senator Daniel and Senator Martin in the lead. As Daniel
filed Into his place and laid aside his crutches the band struck tip "Dlxte." and
the hall resounded with cheers familiar to the ears of old soldiers ot the Army of
the Potomac. There was a glow of enthusiasm In the eyes of the grand old Ro
man face of Daniel as he listened to Irs Inspiring strains. The cheering had
hardly subsided before a gorgeous banner labeled "Hawaii" was brought into
the hall. It was followed by a prince of the blood and r.nother delegate, who re
* ceive<T lou<?- ajvpiause. a* VfrPy took thofr xÂ«ats_ The bund played a porpourrt and
the banners kept time to the* music, .finally the New Tork delegation entered,
but not in a body. -Senator Murphy and Richard Croker took front seats with
Augustus Van Wyck and Thomas F. Grady.
"Witnessed from the platform the scene was exceedingly picturesque as
Chairman Jones called the convention to order. Tom Johnson sat in the Ohio
delegation, fat, fair and fifty. His face glowed with health, his hair curling nat
urally, and his form arrayed In negllge3 costume. As the Missouri delegation
passed to its reservation with ex-Governor Stone at Its head the applause vas
deafening. Stone, like Hill, had had a hard fight for a place on the platform
committee yesterday afternoon. Unlike Hill, however, he won a victory by thÂ«
narrow margin of one vote. Ex-Governor Pattlson of Pennsylvania sat at the
side of Mr. Kerr. dark faced and saturnine, protecting his shirt collar with a
folded handkerchief. ' The delegation from Illinois sat well In front, with Car
ter Harrison at its head. Exceedingly modest and unassuming in manner, he at
tracted universal attention. He wore a tow suit and held the stump of a dgAT
between his teeth. Senator Clark of Montana, who looks like a brother of J.
Hamilton Lewis, occupied the chair In the Montana delegation.
The hall was sprinkled with men of renown and prominence. Governor
McMillan of Tennessee sat with the ladles near him. There were roses in the
Utah and Colorado delegations. Both were represented in part by charming
women. The delegate from. Utah was a brunette, sprightly and pretty, dressed
neatly, but plainly. The lady In the Colorado delegation, although older, was
fully as handsome as her sister from Utah. As Chairman Jones arose, sending
l.roozes throusn hÂ»s silvery beard with a palm leaf fan. Sergeant at Arms Martin
appeared at the secretary's desk and forced order in a loud voice. The call for
the convention was read, and Rev. Dr. Neall was invited to officiate. At the re
quest of Senator Jones all the delegates arose and bowed their head3. A some
what surprising scene occurred before Mr. Neall closes his petition. Array off In
the second gallery on the right a country band began to play "The Banks of
the Wabash." There were exclamations of Indignation from some of the dele
gates, and a minute or more flew by before the band was silenced. The chap
lain sat down, and as Senator Jones was about to proceed with the business of
the convention there was a great uproar In the delegation from Indiana, They
insisted with loud cries that the band should be allowed to finish the "Banks
of the Wabash" before business was resumed. The band itself settled the mat
ter by tooting their horns, and, breaking Into the old familiar strain, aroused
great enthusiasm.
Senator Jones then introduced Jame-. A. Reed, Mayor of Kansas City. In
mellifluous tones and with highly felicitous words the Mayor welcomed the dele
gates to the "Gate City." Governor Thomas, temporary chairman, then ad
dressed the convention. At times he stood with his left hand upon his hip and
continued his s-peech as though reading an extract from the Bible. His address
elicited little applause, because it could not. be heard by the vast body of the
audience. At its conclusion a bust of Bryan was taken upon the platform,
wrapped in the stars and stripes. When unwound and placed upon a pedestal the
great audience rose to Its feet and cheered to the echo. After this a young gen
tleman resembling an actor read the Declaration of Independence. The words
were pronounced as though he was making a speech and not repeating the Im
mortal pronunclamento. He had an air that recalled Arnold at thÂ«
head of his Swiss troops making way for freedom. Then a young lady. -a. blonde,
dressed In exceedingly good taste, sang the "Star-spangled Banner." At the
end of the second verse the audience broke In with "America," and the effect
was overpowering. At least 12,000 voices. Inspired by patriotism. Joined In with the
band.
Then came a great demonstration In honor of Hill. Some said that the noise
makers were hired to do It by Dick Kerens of St. Louis. Governor Hill's friends,
however, claim that it was entirely spontaneous. The cry was taken up by men
in the delegations that had developed the Hill sentiment. It ran across the hall
until It reached the Indiana and Pennsylvania delegations. There It seemed to
gather strength and continued spreading like a prairie fire until the whole con
vention was thoroughly aroused. It then became a tempest, drowning out all
hisses. For some time Governor Hill sat at the aide of Elliott Danforth mop
ping his bald head with his handkerchief and smiling perfunctorily. At times
he glanced at Mr. Croker and Senator Murphy, who sat on a front seat as imper
turbable as castiron and apparently utterly devoid of emotion. At last, urged
by Elliott Danforth and Frank Campbell. Mr. Hill arose and made a profound
bow. While he was bowing the tempest increased in Intensity. He resumed his
seat and there was a lull in the Immense wave of enthusiasm. A moment after
ward he again arose .and bowed profoundly. The uproar was promptly doubled
and the! Senator resumed his seat. A third time did he repeat this movement with
a similar result. The uproar lasted over twenty minutes. The officers of the
convention seemed paralyzed. In vain did the sergeant at arms shout for order.
In vain did the temporary chairman appeal to the audience to restrain them
selves. Ills words were a whistle in a storm. The wind Increased In fury
and did not subside. It'was finally, however, stilled by the band. The divisions
played "The Georgia Camp Meeting" with a vim and a vengeance that set hands
patting and feet beating time. The wind died down and all efforts to revive It
failed.
A Maryland delegate was about to offer a resolution thanking the young lady
for singing a song, but failed to secure recognition, the chairman apparently look-
Ing ur>on' him with suspicion because he had waved the Maryland guidon In an
effort to increase the uproar on behalf of Hill- When order was restored roll
call by States followed to ascertain their selection for Vice President and mem
bers of ..ifferent committees. For some tlma, however, business was again ob
structed by the blare of an outside band, furnished wtth a superfluity of brass
instruments. The. first name cheered when announced as a member of the com
mittee on platform was that of ex-Governor Stone of Missouri. The mention of
Van Wyck's name as the selection of the New York delegation elicited scattering
squeaks for Hill, but a shower of hisses stopped any further demonstration. ThÂ«
convention then took a recess until 4 o'clock. It was taken while the Jackson Club
of Lincoln was filing through the Hall between the delegates and the platform,
shouting their enthusiasm for the Nebraska statesman and waving their colors.
They were evidently farmers and mechanics. Some wore cowhide boots home
spun clothes. There were no silk hats In the procession, nor was there a dia
mond pin or gold ring to be seen. A motley crowd, including women and chil
dren, followed them. The scene recalled pictures of the National Assembly of
France over a hundred. years ago.
At * o'clock the convention again assembled. The committees on credentials
and on platforms were not ready to make their report and a further .recess was
taken until 8 o'clock. Before this was done, however, there was another ap
parent outburst of enthusiasm for Hill. Shouts of "Hill!" "Hill!" came from one
end of the gallery. Senator- Hill was not In his seat In the New York delegation,
but the effort to. create another furor seems to Indicate a determined attempt to
make trouble before Bryan's nomination Is possible

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, KANSAS CITY, Mo.; July 4-;As vet nothing of great impor
tance has occurred in the convention, but to-morrow it is expected we will get down to
business. Everybody's attention is turned toward Bryan. A great deal of the interest that
was at first manifested in a detail of the platform has been los:. Everybody knows now that the
platform will contain the straight-out 16 to i plank. Bryan stands for pure Americanism and strict
adherence to the fundamental prim iples of our great party and the constitution. The great issues
in defeating McKinley's administration will; be anti-imperialism, anti-trust and silver. It is cer
tainly inspiring to see this great body of enthusiastic, bright and intelligent and sincere Democrats
sweltering in the awful heat, proceeding with the work that is necessary to be done. Kansas City
has done herself proud in providing for the comfort, welfare and entertainment of the thousands of
delegates and visitors. I find the convention hall admirably adapted for the purposes of the con
vention. The hotels are many, large and comfortable.
After the convention is over there are so many questions of vital importance that must be
settled in this campaign that- 1 believe the Democratic party will find enough for all' to stand on.
The people of the West are as vehement in their denunciations of the imperialistic policy of the
present administration and in their protest against trusts as are the Easterners. On these issues, at
any rate, we are one, and there is little doubt that we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in the com
ing campaign.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.KAN'S AS CITY. July 4.â Amid scenes
of tumultuous enthusiasm befit
ting such an event and such a day,
the Democratic National Conven
tion began its sessions to-day. But
after sitting until a late hour to
night the expected climax of the dayâ the
nomination of William J. Bryan as the
Democratic candidate for Presidentâ has _
failed of realization, and all of the larger'
business of the convention awaits the com
pletlon of the platform. As a spectacular
event, however, the convention has ful
filled the hopes of the most fervid party
iran, for the vast assemblage of delegates
and spectators has twice been swept with
whirlwind ccmor.Ptrations, first for the
leader who Is about to be placed in nom
ination, and then for that other champion
of Democracy, David B. Hill. But in
actual accomplishment the day's work Is
confined to organization, with the speeches
of the temporary chairman . Governor
Thomas of Colorado, and of the perma
nent chairman. Hon. James D. Richard
son, the appointmert of the various com
mittees and the detailed preparations for
the mcio s-erious work yot in store.
It was an Inspiring scene that Chairman
Jones looked out upon when at noon, after
beating a tattoo with his gavel, he stilled
th/> tumult and declared the convention
epen. About him wÂ«re fully 25.000 persons,
rising tier on tier like the spectators in
some vast coliseum, awaiting the appear
ance of the delegates and alternates of
the party, while on the other side
Ftrotehed away the rows of desks accom
modating representatives Â°f the . press
from every section of the country. Above
end on aii sid^s was a gorgeous sunburst
of color, huge flags and graceful, fan-
Ehar p( i bunting, looped and in lcr.g stream
ers, mottoes and coats of arms of the
United States, mir.s'.'.in? this overhanging
pprtad of color with the bright summer
hats and uretses of the many wemen
present .
Shirt-Sleeved and Dsxnocratic.
But""it was clecrly not a gathering alcne
of wealth and fashion. .The bronzed faces
of many of the men. their coarse shirts,
eollarlegs and Foarfless. marked th^m as
from the soil. Wiih haiuly an exception
they took oft their coats and sat shirt-
Fkoved anÂ«l democratic. Many of the
women were In cambrics and ginghams
rather than in summer si'.ks, and laces
and ihe gorgeous costumc-s and pict
uresque hats were in ar. casis of duller
hue.
It was a gathering none the less inspired
Â¦with the patriotic s-pirit of the day, which
found constant expression in wild hurrahs
et every sound of "America" or "Dixie."
In the body of delegates were the best
known men of the party, many of them of
national reputation. Immediately in front
sat Governor John Walter Smith of Mary
land and his delegation. Alongside them
were that notable New York trio. Croker,
Murphy and Van Wyck. To the right was
the classic face of Daniel of Virginia,
while back of him Arthur Sewall of Maine
end Senator White of California conferred
across the aisle. To the left, at the head
of the Massachusetts delegation, was its
intrepid youn? leader. George Fred Wil
liams. Near him sat Governor McMillin
of Tennessee and the tail, gaunt. Clay-like
:igure of Richardson, soon to be perma
nent chairman of the convention. With
the Kentuckians Fat their youthful Gov
ernor. Beckbam. accompanied by Senator
Klackburn and ex-Governor McCreary.
Senator Hill was late to come upon the
fcene. The great audience had been eag
erly awaiting him, and his entrance was
the signal for the first real ovation of
the day. He found no yiaee reserved
among the Croker-Murphy dignitaries in
the forefront of the delegation and con
tented himself with a seat far In the rear.
Sitting with the Mississippi delegation
was a white-haired woman alternate,
Mrs. \\*. J. Brown of that State, and far
ther back sat Mrs. J. Js". Cohen, another
woman alternate, from Salt Lake City.
T.vro Brilliant Speeches.
The rarly proceedings of the convention
wore marked by two brilliant but rather
i;i-timÂ« v d speechesâ one of welcome from
the Mayor of the city and the other from
CJovernor Thomas of Co'.orado, assuming
the duties of temporary chairman. But
the d<--leÂ£ates fretted during these dellv
erancs and sou#?ht more exciting themes. ,
The first dramatic episode of the day oc
curred after Campau of Michigan had se
cured the adoption of a resolution for the
roadinjr of the Declaration' of Independ
ence. As the reading was ajxÂ»ut to begin
two attendants pushed up to the platform
lÂ«Â»-aring a pedestal find bust, both draped
in the Ftars and stripe?. As 'the orator
raised his voice for the first words of the
Immortal instrument, the draperies were
thrown back, disclosing a splendid head
of Bryan. The effect was electrical upon
the vast assemblage, which up "to that
moment had neither heard the name nor
s=e<-n the face of their leader. As the
massive features were recognized a yell
went up which fairly shook the steel Rird
fTs, and above the storm could be heard
the strains of the band which had broken
out with the national anthem. Men anc
women were on their frot. waving hand
kerchiefs, coats and fays, and joining in
the wild chorus. As the orator sought to
proceed there were demands from all parts
of the. ha!l to fee the full face of thf
leader, and as it was turned about, first
this way and then that, each turn evoked
a fresh outburst from some new quarter.
At la. c t the uproar quieted and Orator
Hampton, youthful and Btrong voiced,
read the document which- 12t years ago
to-day madf America free.
Quickly following this came another
outburst as a young woman from >ew
York mounted the platform and In a clear
soprano voice fans the "Star Spangled
Banner." Deafening chrers greeted the
tons, and as th* last line died away and
the. -sinjrer turned the strains to those of
Â¦"America," the vast audience with one
accord lo<k u]> the inspiring air and bore
it forward in a tumultous paean of the
nation's song.
-Hill' a Popular Idol.
The outburst of patriotism now turned
!n a new direction, and during a momen
tary pause in the proceedings the name
of ""Hill" ma* sounded. It was quickly
caught up. first among the delegates, and
thru from gallery to gallery among, the
Fpeotators. until the whole multitude had
joined in a noisy demand for the former
Senator from New York. For fully ten
minutes the enthusiastic demonstration
proceeded, the chairman battling vainly
ngainst it. relegates stood on chairs and
joined in tho demand, and the Senator
v.-as surrounded by a shouting crowd of
Insistent men. He smiled and shook his
head throughout the . demonstration.
Many of the New Yorlcers joined in, the
tribute, but it was noticpable that the
immediate following of Ttfr. Croker and
tho Tajumany leafier himself held their
foatf and maintained a ptolid composure
throughout , the remarkable tribute to
their associate.

Then a dramatic scene occurred. As
the vast audience was quieting down to
l'.3ten to the reading of the declaration,
two men appeared upon the platform
bearing carefully in their arms two laree
objects, each shrouded in the stars and
stripes. They were placed, the one upon
the other, immediately to the right ana
in front of the chairman. Delegates ana
spectators craned their necks to see what
was about to occur. All realized that a
coup was about to be enacted.
Quickly advancing to the flag-drarwa
objects, a handsome man lifted the ftas

observe the sentiment is adverse
to wars of conquest and in favor
of pursuing those conservative
lines which were indicated by the
founders of the republic.
The reading of the Declaration
of Independence to-day evoked
remarkable enthusiasm, and the
contrast between those who now
seek to use it as an instrument of
oppression andthis convention is
most marked. So true is it that
no individual controls the body
that I do not believe any one can
accurately forecast . even the
mode.bf procedure to be adopted.
It passes without saying that
Bryan will be nominated, but
even at this late hour I am un
able to indicate with any degree
of accuracy his running mate.
There are divergent sentiments
of course, but all are disposed to
listen to argument and to pass
judgment candidly and in such a
way as to conserve the public in
terest and guard the people from
the dangers now menacing them.
There will be no recession from
the position of the Democratic
party toward silver, although it
is possible that it may not be
deemed necessary to prepare or
adopt an elaborate plank upon
the subject.
generous and hearty manifestations of
approval. Despite his strong voice the
confusion in the hall became so great
that much of the speech .was lost to the
delegates and spectators. An Incessant
hum sounded through the building, min
gled with the rustle of thousands of fans
the shuffle of countless feet of messen*
gers and officials and the occasional veil
of some demonstrative spectator. The
audience grew fretful under the disorder
and the Inability to hear, and there were
shouts of "louder!" mingled with de
mands for order. Governor Thomas pro
ceeded boldly, however, and when, above
thÂ© racket, he was heard to exclaim
"South Africa," the crowd caught the
Idea that he was paying tributes to the
Boers and enthusiastic applause went up.
There was another cheer when the crowd
caught enough of the reference to the
isthmian canal to know that It was to bo
under American operation and control.
At the conclusion of the speech tha
building rang with applause, the cheer
ing being' accompanied by trie flutter ot
the national colors throughout the hall.
Campari Introduces a Resolution.
The first semblance of genuine enthusi
asm was created when the secretary of
the convention. Charles A. "Walsh of Iowa,
arose and read a resolution offered by
Daniel J. Campau of Michigan, that the
Declaration of Independence, "drafted by
that Democrat of Democrats, Thomas
Jefferson," be read to the convention or*

lows:
The national Democratic committee, having
met in the city of Washington, on the twenty
second day of February, i9(K>, has appointed
Wednesday, the 4th day oi July, as the time,
and chosen the city of Kansas City, Mo., as the

vention. Each State is entitled to a repre

its' Senators and Representatives in the Con-
Bress of the United States; and each territory.
Alaska. Indian Territory and the District of
Columbia, shall have six delegates. All Demo
cratic conservative reform citizens of the
United States, irrespective of past political as
sociations and differences, who can unite with
us in the efCort for pure, economical and con
stitutional government, and who favor the re
public and oppose the empire, are cordially in
vited to Join us In sending delegates to the
convention.
Rev. Mr. Neal's Prayer.
Chairman Jones then announced the
prayer by the Rev. S. M. Neal. which was
as follows: *.
Almiehty God, God of our fathers, we ac
knowledge thee to be our God. Our nation was
founded In faith and hope in thee. Thy provi
dence has protected and frulded us in the past.
Thy goodness has i made us great. We still
recognize thee as sovereign, and acknowledge
no other. We are dependent upon thee. We
look' to ihee. Our hope is in thee. Mercifully
fcrclve our sins and srulde us Into all truth.
May we never, as a nation, forget God. Com
mand thy blessing upon the delegates of this
convention, may they be men who fear God
and work righteousness and be accepted of him.
Inspire them with an exalted patriotism and a
broad statesmanship. Thou art moving among
the. nations of the earth. We .have come to a
crisis as to our future policy as a nation.' Il
lumine us by thy spirit that we may have the
power of vision to discern between richt.and
wrong. As thou hast guided us in the past, be
pleased, we humbly ask. to pilot us over the
breakers now. Save us from the offense of ap
proaching thee only to have our views rati
fied. May we come in all sincerity and hu
mility to inquire what the Lord our God wquld
have us do. Overrule our prejudices and ren
der clear our Judgments. Save us. from the re
proach that any power among us Is almlshty,
but the will of God as expressed in the voice
of all the people. Mercifully preserve us from
ollrarachy and communism. May the prin
ciples of the golden rule prevail: may truth,
justice, equality and liberty be guarded with
jealous care; Lord God Almighty mnke; bars
thy arm: be thou our God. Grant that what
in flone hÂ»>re may meet thy approval. Thy
kingdom come thy will be done on earth as It
is In heaven. We ask In the name of Jesus
Christ, our Lord and Savior, amen.
Mayor Reed's Greeting.
. "Gentlemen will please be in order."
said. Chairman Jones, as the hum and
bustle again broke loose after the prayer.
"We must have quiet on the floor. Gen
tlemen of the convention. I have the
honor to present to you the Mayor of
Kansas City, Jamo? A/ Reed."
A shout of applause went up as the
slender form of -Mr. â¢ Reed . came to the
front of the platform. He spoke deliber
ately ana with a clear, resonant voice,
that easily penetrated to every corner of
the hall. Tho ilrst burst of applause that
greeted the Mayor's speech of welcome
came when he spoke of the universality
of the Democratic doctrine. . which had
penetrated, he paid, wherever liberty was
Known and loved. He dwelt .at eorae
length on the progress of the principles
of the Democratic party, which origin
ated, ho Raid. .with tho liberty-loving peo
ple of France. and England, and. came to
this continent for, its larger growth and
ultimate development. His allusion to the
early leaders of the Democratic [ party-
Jefferson and Jackson â evoked outbursts
of cheers. He declared that Jefferson be
lieved in expansion only as it made homes

tinent./ :..-..Â¦ Â¦ â¢ â¢ Â¦:.;Â¦Â¦'.. v :.'.Â¦.

of tumultuous sound drowned everything,
and he dropped back into his seat.
' When the delegates had time to think
they beean to ask each other if Hill was
to be the hero of this convention, for
another such demonstration, at an op
portune time, might carry the convention
off its feet end place him on the ticket
with Bryan, in spite of all contrary cal
culations.
The routine proceedings were quicKiy
disposed of. But even in this there was
opportunity to give further tribute to the
New Yorker, and when Judge Van "VV yck s
name was called as the New York mem
ber of the platform committee a tremen
dous call for Hill, mingled with hisses for
those who opposed him, greeted the an
nouncement. With the committees ap
pointed there was nothing to do but await
their action, and the convention took a
recess at 2:30 until 4 o'clock. As the dele
gates filed out of the hall they pressed
around Senator Hill, who for half an hour
was the center of an enthusiastic personal
greeting from individual delegates. At 4
o'clock the committees were not yet ready
to report, and another adjournment was
taken until 8:30 p. m.
Thirty Minutes of Cheering.
It remained for the night session to
bring the most remarkable demonstration
of the day. Again the great structure
Â¦was Invaded by thousands, and the mag
nificent picture took on new glories of
color and animation under the glare of
countless electric lights. For the first
hour the proceedings were formal and
profitless, but when, at the close of the
Speech of Permanent Chairman Richard
son, he paid a glowing tribute to William
J Bryan, pandemonium broke loose and
the historic scene of Bryan's nomination
at Chicago was repeated, even exceeding,
in a frenzied demonstration lasting hall
nn hour. The State standards were
wrenched from their sockets and borne
aloft, a battle of supremacy was waged
between the standard-bearers, urged on
by the deafening applause of the entire
shouting, gesticulating multitude.
Outside of the formal proceedings of the
day interest was centered in the action of
the platform committee. A3 the evening
advanced it became known that a de
termined struggle was in progress. Involv
ing not only the question of incorporating
a specific 16-to-l declaration in the pnrty
declaration, but to some extent involving
the desires of the prospective nominee aa
to the terms of the platform. The out-
Come is awaited with absorbing interest
as the chief development of to-morrow.i

KANSAS CITY, July 4.-At 12:02 p. m.
Chairman J.ones ascended the platform.
As the wave of applause subsided Chair
man Jones rapped vigorously and repeat
edly.' i-tllHng the tumult, and then above
the" din his voice could be heard announc
ing:
"The convention will come to order.
The ser?eant-at-arms will see that the
aisles are cleared."
Sergeant-at-Arms Martin advanced to'
the front and urged the crowds in front
of the platform to tal:e seats. Great dis
order prevailed; the aisles Jammed with
shifting, noisy crowds of subordinate of
ficials and Intruders, and It took some time
to secure quiet.
Beading of the Call.
The first business was the readme of the

Thobe who assert that the money question is
deal have given but little heed to the lesson
of experience. It can never die until it shall
receive a rishteous solution.
The phenomenal increase in the output of golil
has materially added to- the general stock of
primary money and relieved some part of the
fetress of contraction which succeeded the clos
ure of the Indian mints to silver in 1893. The
consequent improvement in business and In the
industrial conditions may be traced directly to
this fact, although the failure of crops in vari
ous portions of the world and the waging of a
great offensive war, with its accompanying ex
penditure of treasure, have contributed to the
teneral result. The enlarcement of the sum
cf our metallic money has cheapened its value,
stimulated prices and set the "wheels of enter
prises agai nln motion. No more signal demon
stration of th? bimetallic contention was ever
witnessed. Had the concurrent coinage and
circulation of th? two metals b?en uninter
rupted they would have kept ths quantity of our
money of redemption in harmony with our na
tional growth end our development apace with
the increased wealth and population. The ter
rible crises of the past quarter of a century
with tneir attendant miseries and bankruptcy
would have been avoided and prosperity would
have remained with us unbroken and enduring.
Ths false plea of 1SS6 that the monetary
volume was sufficient and the world's supply of
*rold ample for its needs is now transparent.
Its error is, admitted In the boast of our op
ponents that they have Increased our per
capita circulation. The vast quantities yield
ed by the mines are readily absorbed by the
ceaseless demand for its use and its multi
plied increase is earnestly hoped for. Xo voice
is raised 'against its continued production. No
fear is expressed that we can be embarrassed
by Its abundance. Yet its annual output ex
ceeds that of gold and silver in the years when
the latter was repudiated because of its threat
ened Inundation. . Our opponents stand con
fronted by the irresistible operation of a law
they, have denied.
As to New Possessions.
Referring to the war with Spain the
Governor said:
The prevailing sentiment of Democratic sym
pathy for all people struggling lor the blessings
of liberty impelled the administration two
years ago to Interfere with the despotic tyran
ny of Spain over Cuba and secure to the op
pressed people of that island the right of Self
government. Our ultimatum delivered, we
solemnly and officially declared them to be
free ami independent and disclaimed to the
world any disposition or intention to exercise
sovereignty, jurisdiction- or control over the
island, except for the pacification thereof and
nssertpd our determination when that was ac
complished to leave the Government and con
trol or the Island to Its people.
The conditions of the ensurrnj war sent Ad
miral Dewey to, the distant Philippines, where
another people engaged In' the Fame struggle
with the same oppressor appealed to the same
impulses of our nature. There he broke the
power of Spain, which, suing; for peace, sub
mitted to the liberation of Cuba and cession of
Porto : Itlco. Our Government disdained the
spirit of its manifesto of April and became
the purchaser ot" the Philippines in January.
Since then we have given Cuba the benefit of
our civic Institutions by governing her through
the War Department. \Ve have kept faith with
Porto Rico by substituting the; suftar baron for
the Casiilian Duke, and confirmed the Philip
pine estimate of- the white man by prolonging
tho^ Spanish method of colonial government in
those islands of the far-off seas. The national
sympathy for all who seek seK-povernment has
been made I tbe Instrument by which cupidity
and preed acquire and hold a feeble nation in
thraldom against Its will. The ripht tif pur
chase Is invoked to Justify the adoption by the
prreat Western republic of a so-called colonial
policy and . her glorious institutions are de
clared to be for home consumption with pro
hibitive duties asalnst their exportation.
For One System *bf Expansion.
AVo believe in that system of expansion which
under ' Democratic rule brought half' the con
tinent as a galaxy of commonwealths into the
Union. We denounce that expansion which by.
conquest overcomes the people of another hem

A yell of approval greeted his announce
ment that the convention was gathered
u mn Democratic soil and as the guests
of a Democratic constituency that had
always been to the forefront of the politi
cal lights of the country. When he de
clared that in the name of that Democ
racy he bade the visiting delegations wel
come and proclaimed victory at the polls
in November, he was interrupted by
cheers and applause, and the applause
when he finished was long.
Cheers and Hisses for Hill.
The delegates and spectators had lis
tened with great attention but no enthu
siasm, applauding the closing sentence.
Senator Hill entered just at this moment
and the applause turned to him. ,â.â'
"Hill of New York!" "Hill!" "Hill!"
they shouted. But it was noticed that the
New York delegation did not respond to
the enthusiasm. Hill came in with Elliott
Danforth of New York and stopped at the
row. â¢
Delegate John McMahon of Rome arose
and gave his seat to the ex-Senator. Hill
smiled and thanked him. Meanwhile the
crowd continued to yell for "Hill! Lets
hear Hill!" with a few hisses interspersed
until the chairman finally rapped them to
order. A few minutes later they renewed
the call, but the audience was impatient
to get on with the proceedings and showea
its disapproval with hisses. .
Finally the-chairman was able to make
his voice heard, and he introduced Gov
ernor Thomas of Colorado, the temporary
chairman. , ' _
A round of applause .greeted
Thomas as he ascended the platform, Â±ic

dignified, black-garbed, his face showing
intellectuality and force of character.
Chairman Thomas' Speech.
Governor Thomas held In his hand the
typewritten manuscript of, his speech, and
in full Tound voice, easily reaching to the
remotest corners of the building, he began
his address as temporary chairman. He
said:
The line of division between political forces
became fchan-ly defined in 1S96 upon
what- wan called the money question. That
qucnllcn involved, as we then asserted and as
we now know, every other econom c problem.
It embraced within its wide limitations the la
such of labor and capital, of combination and
competition, of production, transportation and
distribution. It was predicted that the dÂ«Â«H
of. bimetallism would be followed by the retire
ment of a'.l form* of Government currency, by
the Â¦rteiecatlcn of the power ; of note Issue tc

been verified. , : -
Democratic defeat had scarcely been recorded
when the march ot consolidation was resumed.
Every avenue of industry is closed to the com

real and fictitious accumulations and their more

public , opinion finding expression at the polls
in support of the nominees of th!s convention.
. ~ . - Democracy Protests.
Governor-Thomas then spoke of the cur
rency bill passed by the last sessldn of
Congress, -giving a resume- of its most I
important features, adding: : Â¦-
'Against 1 this Iniquitous echeme of finance

We would .build the Nicaragua canal as an

We would operate it in times of peace and

We would relieve the people of the burden of

sures us with every moon that the Philippine
Insurrection Is over. The treasury is bursting
with a plethoric revenue, millions whereof are
deposited with favorite banks which lend It to
the people, on their own terms that the volume
of circulation may not suffer diminution. Not
withstanding these conditions, there is no de
crease in taxation. Measures cunningly de
vised to fall on the backs of the people and
screen large Interests from responsibility from
the' public burdens, willingly assumed and
cheerfully borne In the heat of conflict, press
with full weight In times of peace with no
signs of relief from the party in power. Un
necessary taxation Is unjust taxation and 1 un
just taxation by -whatever name it may be
called Is the plunder of the citizen by his Gov
ernment.
Speaking of the nomination to* be made
by the convention Governor Thomas said:
Kind of Man Democracy Wants.
"We would have for our. Chief Magistrate a
man sprung from the loins of the people, rock
ribbed in his convictions and controlled by the
admonitions of his conscience. A man of lofty
ideals and steadfast courage. A man to whom
his country"s constitution appeals with a l>vinÂ«?
and sacred reality. A man who exalts the
duty, the rights and the welfare of his fellow
citizens above the sinister and corroding influ
ence of centralised commercialism. A man
whose ear is untuned to the pulsations of the
pocket-book, but responsive to the heart-throbs
of the masses. A man with no Warwick be
hind his chair, with policies that are fala own.
A man with strong opinions and a strong will
to enforce them. A man conscious of his
country's dignity and power, of Its capacity to
cope with all conditions. A man who meaf
ures the greatness of the republic by the pro
tection It gives to the humblest citizen. A man
whose clear vision perceived the causes and
whose- steady judgment determined the remedy
for the ills of . the body politic. A man who
will lay the strong hand cf authority utton the
vast interests, the moral, industrial and po
litical life of the nation and maintain the in
tegrity of our institutions asatnst all their
designs and encroachments.. A man who rec
ognizes no dignity greater than that of an
American ; citizen, no right more rac-red than
that which secures to him the full enjoyment
of every opportunity that a land like ours
affords. A man whose opinions don't change
with his apr>arel. whose policies are not fash
ioned from day to day by influences that con
trol and direct him. whose "plain duty" con
sists not in sanctioning the repudiation of his
own counsels. We -want a man of no plastic
mold conforming his opinion to passing Impres
sions of popular- sentiment, as facile In their
abandonment ea in thsir advocacy. We want
a rcan to whom right is. greater than expe
diency, who postpones no duty to the demand
of privilege, who is loved by the multitude,
respected br the world and feared only by
those who distrust the people.
Governor Thomas closed his address
with an arraignment of the . Republican
party for what he declared was its Insin
cere course and its chance from a party
of freedom to one of monopoly and mili
tarism and added:
Against the continuance of this party In
power we- enter protest. With the man ex
alted above the dollar, the constitution above
the combination, the equality of all before the
law, with solemn promises to correct the
abuses of administration and to enforce these
fundamentals of government, which secure "ex
act justice to all. we shall not appeal In vain
to the wisdom, intelligence and the patriotism
of the American people.
Disorder in the Convention.
-His severe- arraignment of the "In
trenched enemy" drew a. ripple of ap
plause, and 'as . he proceeded his well
rounded sentences were punctuated with

plause swept over the audience. From
side to side the bust was turned that all
might know whom he represented. â¢ s
Â¦ When the * applause had subsided,
Charles Hampton, of Peterskey, Mich.,
read in magnificent voice the immortal
Declaration of Independence. As the full
and rounded sentences of the great state
paper rolled â¢ through the hall the cheer
ing and enthusiasm increased and when
Mr. Hampton had concluded the tremen
dous applause fairly shook the building.
When the applause ceased Miss Ful
toni of New 1'ork was introduced and
sang "The Star-spangled Banner," the au
dience standing and cheering after each
verse. It was an Innovation in, a nation
al convention. Then, as she finished the
last strain; the band took up "America"
and. led by Miss Fultonl, 20,000 persons
broke into the stirring words of "My
Country, 'Tis of Thee," singing it through
with unction and closln? it with a cheer.
Clamorous for Hill.
Then suddenly ; somebody started the
cry for "Hill," "Hill." In an Instant Ma
ryland, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi
and New Mexico were on their feet, wav
ing their standards and yelling "Hill,".
"Dave Hill." The pounding of the chair
man's gavel had no effect and for., a time
it looked like a concerted movement to
stampede for the New Yorker. As dele
gation Â¦ after . aelegation arose In their
seats and 1 â¢ the chairman's , gavel fell, Mr."
Hill was compelled -to arise and bow. This
was the signal Â¦ for . pandemonium ,Â¦:.Â¦ and
nothing : seemed tobe able to stop -the
torrent of - anplause. A few hisses were
met with -volleys of cheers and' finally a ;
part of New York's delegation arose and
joined the applauding hosts. Croker,
Murphy, Van Wyck and the Tammany
delegation kept their seats without Join
ing in it.
For fully ten minutes the applause and
disorder continued, the steady rap of the
gavel having no effect. Each time a new
atate standard was pulled up and waved
the applause began anew. After his first
bow to the audience Hill kept his seat,
but he could not disguise, the gratifica
tion that he felt at the reception accord
ed him. Friends urged him to. take the
platform, but he kept shaking' his head
negatively. On the platform the chairman
and the sergeant-at-arms tried in vain
to get order.
Finally Hill himself, hoping to stem
the torrents of applause, arose. Then
the delegates and the crowd howled them
selves hoarse. "Hill I" "Platform!" they
screamed. , ; " . . . . ,
"Mr. Chairman," he ejaculated, but his
voice was drowned In the fierce burst of.
applause. Â¦ Â¦
"Mr. Chairman." he tried again to say,
and then, drowned out again, sank laugh-
Ing in his seat. ' â¢
Just before the demonstration over Mr.
Hill began. Delegate Joshua A. Miles, a
former Congressman from Maryland, ad
vanced toward the platform occupied by
the presiding officer, and waved the Mary
land standard. There was so much noise
throughout the hall that her could not
be heard four feet from where he stood.
He said that he had arisen to move the
thanks of the convention to the young
lady who had so moved the convention
by her rendition of a song which had been
written by a Maryland; patriot. The
motion was announced in Mr. Miles most
energetic manner, but it was not heard
by a single delegate and the presiding
officer found no opportunity- to submit It.
When, after fifteen minutes, order was
restored. Governor Thomas administered
a stern warning to the assemblage, stat
ing that the convention was here to do
business and that if the spectators inter
rupted the work by unseemly disorder,
the officers of the convention would bÂ«
directed to clear the galleries.
Hisses for ,Van Wyck.
The call of States began for naming the
members of the various committees. This
was a tedious work, covering all the cau
cus selections of the several States and
Territories. When the name of Carter H.
Harrison was called as the Illinois mem
ber of one of the committees, it brought
out a round of cheers and calls for Har-'
rison which for a moment threatened to
be a repetition of the Hill demonstration.
The names of Governor Overmeyer, Sen
ator Blackburn. George Fred Williams
and W -J. Stone -also elicited cheers.
When Augustus Van. Wyck was an
nounced as the New York member of the
platform committee there . was a storm
of mingled hisses and cheers and another
demand for "Hill. Delegates Grady 8nd
Malloy of New York led in the applause
for Mr. Van Wyck's name. It took a vig
orous play with the gavel to restore or
der and allow the call to proceed.
After the name of thÂ« last commlttee
mai, had been given Chairman Thomas
announced that a motion had been made
giving the thanks of the convention to the
lady who had sung "The Star-Spangled
Banner." It was carried.
A delegate; from Ohio secured the at
tention of the chairman by violent ges
ticulation and then, mounting on his chair
as he was recognized, moved that an In
vitation be extended to Mr. Bryan to
visit the convention. A wild cheer of ap
plause* went up before the chairman had
been given time to hear a second to the
motion. ;..\ Â¦'
While the cheering over the Bryan â¢ mo
tion/was. at its height \ the booming of a
brass baud was heard at the south en
trance anddown the aisle In front of the
chairman's desk came the band,, which
came ' here Â¦ with ', Clark of Montana, â¢ and
behind It in column. of twos, or as nearly
as they could keep that formation, the
Jacksonian Club of Nebraska. The band
was playing "Dixie" and the old air
caused the yell of delight which greets it
always. The members of the Jacksonian
Club had with them a large number of
ladles and as there were no seats for them
a dense throng was soon packed in front
of the chairman's desk. It was impossi
ble for Chairman Thomas to hear a word
uttered four feet from his desk, but some
delegates near him made a motion to ad
journ until 4 o'clock, which was at once

Afternoon Proceedings.
Although the afternoon session of the
convention was to have begun at 4 o'clock
there were not over fifty delegates in
their seats at that time and the galleries
were not more than half filled. At the
moment the convention should hayÂ©
opened a small messenger boy wÂ»3
perched in the chairman's seat inundat
ing himself with copious draughts from
the chairman's private stock of Ice water.
By 4:30 o'clock about half of the various
delegations were In their seats and the
band was pounding out ragtime airs to
entertain the crowd which filled every
seat and occupied every square foot of
standing room outside of the space re
served for the delegates and alternates.
Chairman Thomas, warm and perspiring,
mounted the rostrum at 4:33.
The recess gave a chance to the Hill ad
mirers to crowd about him and for fully
twenty minutes they forbade him leaving
the hall, shaking his hand and congratu
lating him on the ovation he had received.
When the convention began assembling
the principal point of interest seemed to
be the New York delegation and around It
swarmed the delegates from other States,
anxious to see Hill, Croker, Van Wyck
and other celebrities.
At 4:43 Chairman Thomas* gavel called
the convention to order, the delay being
caused by the non-arrival of the delegates
and the desire on the part of the conven
tion leaders to afford the committees time
to prepare their â¢eports. Despite the con
tinued rapping for order by the chairman
the convention was slow In reaching such
a state of quiet as . would admit of the
transaction of business.
Chairman Thomas announced that the
committee on credentials was not ready
to report as yet. Instead of following tho
programme that previously had been ar
ranged, and proceeding 1 at once to the
other business of the convention, Josephus
Daniels of North. Carolina was recognized
by the chairman for a motion to adjourn
until 8:30 to-night.
Amid considerable confusion Chairman
Thomas, at 4:51, declared the motion car

BOISTEROUS
SESSIONS OF
CONVENTION
The first mention of Mr. Bryan's name
came near the end of Chairman Teller's
speech. It started a perfect storm of ap
plause, but the demonstration was excelled
by that which occurred when Charles, A.
Towne's name was mentioned. The dele
gates one and all. jumped to their feet,
waving flags, handkerchiefs, fans and
hats and Bhoutlng and cheering for Bryan
and Towne. For two or three minutes
the delegates cheered for their choices,
and when a moment later Chairman Tel
ler finished his speech and sank -nearly
exhausted into his chair he was surround
ed by delegates on the stage and congrat
ulated.
E. S; Corser of Minnesota presented a
resolution providing for a committee of
fifteen, of which Henry M. Teller should
be chairman,' to present to the Demo
cratic convention the name of Charles 'A.
Towne as a candidate for Vice President,
and that a similar committee of confer
ence be appointed to confer with a com
mittee which shall be appointed by the
Democratic National Convention.
The various State delegations announced
their selections for members of the com
mittees, and pending their organization
and report the convention adjourned until.
10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The committee on resolutions. Senator
Duboia chairman, had a protracted ses
sion to-night. Several drafts of platforms
and numerous amendments were read and
discussed. A sub-comnalttee of seven,
Senator Dubois chairman, was appointed
to take up the eeveral reports and amend
ments seriatim and report a platform to
the committee to-morrow after the ad
journment of the morning session..
Chairman Teller was given the closest
attention throughout his speech, which
was nearly an hour in duration.
"Were we wrong in leaving the St. Louis
convention?" questioned he, and a thunder
of noes came from the delegates. "If I
had not left the party in 1896 I would have
done so even' month since," said he. "The
conditions now are a thousand times
worse than they were then."
> Cheers for Bryan and Towne.
"With sucn. a record is it 'strange that thou
sands of men who have been members or the
Republican party find It inconsistent with their
sense of duty to continue in Its support, and
turn to some other organization to find a belter
expression of their views? I feel assured that
with Mr. Bryan's nomination and election will
come a better condition of administration In
all departments of the Government â a better
hope for the masses; better opportunities far
struggling labor and liberty to our own pcop.e
and all that are within our jurisdiction in thÂ«
lslands of the seas. â¢ .
Mr. Teller referred to the refusal of Con
eTess<to adopt a resolution of sympathy
with the Boers, and closed as follows:
Its policy is not. as it '.was once, to rely upon
the people to support Republicanism, and to
maintain order and obedience to law, but. on
the contrary, it now demands an army of 100,
000 men, not to defend the country against a
foreign foe. but to defend the wealth of the
country against the people of the country. At
one time individual judgment and conscience
governed Senators and Representatives In Con
gresB; now it is a caucus that controls the
action of the representatives of the States and
the people. Caucus domination Is bad. but it
Is worse when, as now, the caucus Is controlled,
not bv Senators or members, but by influences
entirely outside of official life.
To-daj' it stands for all the combines and
syndicates that . are robbing the people be
cause It derives its great power and strength
from such combinations.
says kingly power, always professedly exer
cised for the welfare of the subjects. \
The results In Cuba do not justify 'any laud
ation of the appointees or of the method of
their selection, for a more disgraceful chap
ter in American history has not been written
than this of the administration of postal affairs
In Cuba under Republican officials.
Rhetorical flights about our destiny and our
duty to take charse of the government and
morals of the Philippines against their will
and to secure to them the blessings of . free
institutions will not deceive the American peo
ple any more than It will the objects of our
supposed benevolence. â¢
What they demand of us is that we shall
be true to our traditions and declarations that
"the Just powers of government are derived
from the consent of the governed." A guar
antee that such will be our policy will doubt
less bring peace "to the PhHIppines.
He declared that the Republican party
was no longer the party of the people, as
it was for many years, and said:
KANSAS CITT. July 4.â The na
tional convention of the Silver
Republican party met in the Au
ditorium Theater to-day. The
delegates were rather slow In
firrivinF and It was some time after
:2 o'clock, the hour fixed for thÂ© con
vention, when Chairman Charles A.

Twenty-four States and Territories were

tlvely few spectators were present, owing
to the assembling of the Democratic Na

Shortly before 1 o'clock the Minnesota

t. huge, uar.urr bearing the pictures of
Bryan and Towne, entered the hall amid
a.' ruar of cheering, and a moment after
ward Chairman Towne rapped the con
vention to order and introduced Rev. Mr.
BfgÂ« low of Cincinnati, who Invoked divine

Dr. fcigelow's prayer was a passionate

Chairman Towne's Address.
Temporary Chairman Towne then dellv
Â«r*d the following address?:
Gentlemen of the Convention: I congratulate
you that it is your privilege to witness the aus
picious opening of the one hundred and twentv
fourth aT-.r.lverE&ry of the birthday of vne ri
r-ub:ic. and that a day Â«o rich In the fallowed
euer'sticne or our peculiar citizenship and tn
the priceless memories or our national hletory
Is here dedlcrted to one of the most Important
and scleiKn duties that ca.n devolve upon
Americans.
I congratulate you also upon the character In
which ~ ou Â¦Â¦*â¢ assembled. A Silver Republican
convention is always a meeting of patriots.
Treatise It Is composed of men who by their ac
tions have shown how superior to party alle
sriance they hold the obligations of citizenship
tnd how lax above the allurements of personal
Â«. rr.bitlons thÂ»-y place the progress of a great
caure an4 the welfare of the whole country.
Flr.a!ly. I congratulate you upon the high
purpose that brings you together. In common
with the chosen representatives of that great
crÂ«ranlfyÂ»tlon whlf-h occupies the center of the
alliÂ»-<l political reform forces of the nation, we
have come to this beautiful city to taXe coun
f\ together touching the dangers that threaten
The republic: to reaffirm the fundamental prtn
c-ifles of human liberty and popular Institu
tions: to declare the policies that should con
trol the legislation and administration of the
Government, and to nominate candidates for
Vice President end President of the United
states.
On the Fourth of Jul
Tfc* whole circuit of the year could offer to this
occasion no other day so appropriate to its
r.l.Ject bt the fourth day of July. It will be
one of the chW duties of these two great con
vention* to meet the present crave crisis in
Â«-;Â«r hif-lory, due to the recreancy of Republican
Jrarteirhip. to the fundamental principles of our
Just Hut irnÂ«, by proclaiming anew the Immortal
truths <if the Declaration of Independent and
by calllnc upon the jiatrfotiFm of the country
to maintain and perpetuate the glorious tradi
t."cs of the republic. For a century' and a
quarter this Â«Â«f has been sacred to tries- holy
ideals. \\*> ha\Â«- welcomed its advent with ac
clamations of joy. We have celebrated its
1-riwjress with patriotic exercises, with music
an.l *r.nr and In *lÂ«*ch. We bare lighted ltÂ»
d'-rarture with bonfires and with neaven-
Fearrh'.tiR torches alraon rivaling the brii-
Uucy of the Ftars. This we ha*% done be
cause on that fateful Fourth of July morning
a hundred an<i tw*>nty-four years msto our
fathers proclaimed the birth of a new nation
jiinopp the powers of the earthâ a nation in the
'vordf of the greater Uf publican, "conceived
Sia liberty and dedicated to the proposition that
I CH men are created Â«Hiual." because <1urir.tr
Â¦ .-wry moment of our biFtory since then until
irow the t-ubllme proclamations of that declara
tion have faithfully voiced the convictions and
arriratim* of an overwhelming majority of the
Am'-rir-an people, and because we have always
believed. as we most devoutly do believe to-
day, tEat the preservation of this republic and
the accomplishment of Its mission of peace and
liberty among the people of the earth depend
upon the reverent observance and stalwart de
fense by us of the principles thus announced
by our fathers.
For us. a? former members of the Republi
can party, a special though now melancholy in
terest attaches to the Declaration of Independ
ence for the reason that when the first national
convention of that party assembled in the his
toric city of Philadelphia forty-four .years ago
last month the inevitable associations of the
place and the then noble sentiments of the
party causrj the adoption of a platform of
which the following is the first clause of the
very first resolution:
"Resolved. That the maintenance of the
principles promulgated in the Declaration of
Independence and embodied In the Federal con
stitution Is e-ip ntial to the preservation of our
republican institutions."
The Philadelphia Convention.
A few days ago another convention of the
Republican party met in the city of Philadel
phia, the date being selected as near as possi
ble to the anniversary of the convention ot
1&56. But mark this startling and most signi
ficant fa*t: In. all ibe numerous resolutions
so skillfully framed Â£y' this convention of 1900,
there appears not "He resolution, not one word,
not one syllable of reference to the Declara
tion of Independence. Could anything more
clearly Illustrate the decadence of that once
splendid and patriotic organization? The sacred
precincts of the old colonial capital sheltered
for them no shade of Washington or Jefferson
or Henry or Otis or Rutledge or Adams. For
theYn there was no magic In the name of "Phll
adelj'hla." whese very utterance has been wont
to stir the souls of four generations of Ameri
cans witfa memories of Independence day, In6.
For them no precedent spoke of June, 1856.
Stranpe. inexplicable, that a' great convention
of Republicans could assemble in the city of
Philadelphia and remain deaf and dumb to the
echoes of that momentous history! "While every
"babbling RosMp of the air" was repeating over
and over again tÂ» those that had ears to hear,
"that all men are created equal: that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain un
aiienable rights; that among- these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of hippiness: that to
fecure these lights governments are instituted
amone men, deriving their Just powers from
the consent of the governed": to them the
associations of the place were as dumb as the
riven throat of old Liberty Bell.
And so that convention adjourned without
proclaiming Its devotions to the doctrines
whose fame had glorified and sanctified not
only the city where It met. but the early days
of the party whose ancient faith it repudiated.
Calls It Hanna's Party.
For. eentlemen of the convention. It needed
but this one act of sacrilege to complete the
demonstration that the party of Marcus A.
Hanna stands for absolutely nothing. In either
doctrine or spirit, that characterized the party
of Abraham Lincoln. The men whom we to
day immediately- represent left the Republican
party in 1S:<6 chiefly because of its action at St,
Louis in betraying the cause of bimetallism
and .surrendering to the banking combination.
Fundamentally that question is as vital now
as It was then. But the movement toward the
fcOld standard was only a specific example of
a general tendency. A. money monopoly has
been followed by all the other monopolies, and
the resulting plutocracy, pursuing the course
of Its prototypes in ancient and medieval his
tory, now seeks further exploitation by con
quest and to entrench its power behind the
class distinctions and centralized authority of
militarism. That party has become the in
strument of the forces of reaction atralnst the
principles of democratic*! institutions. All
men who eee the danger must unite to avert
It. If we had not left the Republican party
In 1SS6 we should be compelled, as patriots, to
leave in 1900, and forever.
Tb* party of Lincoln, in the preamble to its
JJrst platform, adopted in June, 1S56. declared its
purpose to be to restore "the action of Fed
eral Government to the principles of Washing
ton and Jefferson." The principles of Wash
ington and Jefferson may be thus briefly sum
marized: Abroad, no entanpllng alliances; at
home, equal rights for all. special privileges to
none. The present leadership of the Repub
lican party ha* revolutionized the foreign pol
icy of the Government and whether, as we have
abundance of evidence for believing, there la a
virtual alliance between the United States and
Great Britain at this moment or not. certain It
is that, in the words or Washington, we have
left "our own to Etand upon foreign ground,"
and that euch an alliance must inevitably be
the Issue of the present diplomacy ol the ad
ministration, tf persisted In.
In our domestic concerns the Republican
party, by a careful system of special privileges
to the few. has built up the power of certain
cruel and nelflsh influences until they are pre
dominant in Industry and politics and have
virtually destroyed the democratic element In
our social life and' in the Government. By
law the great fpÂ»eulative banks have been em
powered to usurp the eoverelsn function of ls-
Fuing currency and to establish a gigantic
money trust. Throueh failure to enaet appro
priate legislation and to enforce existing stat
utes, and by tariffs dictated by special Inter
ests, vast monopolies in .production and trans
portation have h*en enabled to erect and main
tain a despotism over the Industry Â° r the
country-
Repudiation Alleged.
Bimetallism, as ancient and honorable faith
of the Republican party, has been openly re
pudiated by Its degenerate modern leadership,
after a course of euch brazen hypocrisy as has
awakened the amazement of mankind. ' Pro
tection, declared in Abraham Lincoln's plat
form of 1SC0 to be a policy incidentally to be
observed in the raising of necessary revenue
by tariff duties, has been made an end In
Itself and distorted Into an engine of oppression
and robbery of the many for the benefit of the
few as represented by the monopolies and trust
combinations. '
And recently, ;.. the culmination of a long
progress of abandonment, we have . seen the
Republican party turn away finally from its
most fundamental faith and sever the last
remaining link that bound it to a glorious
past. It has repudiated the Declaration of In
dependence. It has proclaimed the pre-emi
nence of Congrew above the constitution. From
the championship 0 ? freedom, striving always
and everywhere to amplify its guarantees and
to broader, its definition, it has descended to be
come the advocate ot the rzgnt of conquest and
to pettlfor in the forum of the reason and
sympathy of mankirii to nhow how narrow and
clrcurnBcrlbed nnÂ«l accidental a thine a liberty
Is. The rlchts of unfortunate nations, who bo
prize liberty that they are willing to die for it,
are declared to rest no longer la original Jus-
tice. but on the permission of a Republican ad
ministration. The platform adopted last month
at Philadelphia declares "that the blessings oi
liberty" are to be â¢'conferred upon all the
rescued peoples" by the Republican party. It
was the belief of Washington and Jefferson and
Lincoln. It was the ancient faith of the Ameri
can people, that God gives liberty to all races
of men and that no splf-vaunted benevolent des
potism can either confer.it or take it away.
What God has decreed to be the inheritance of
a.l men McKInley shall not be permitted to
deny to any. We appeal from the last plat
form of the Republican party to the Declaration
of Independence; from the impious presumption
of a perverse President to the eternal Justice
of the Almighty Father, "whose Judgments are
true and righteous altogether."
Mr. Towne's declaration that the Re
publican platform amounted 'to a repeal
of the Declaration of Independence
brought the delegates to their feet, and
his statement that the convention had
met to redeclare the principles of that
instrument was enthusiastically ap
plauded.
* Senator Teller Introduced.
"I wish now to Introduce aV temporary
chairman," said Mr. Towne, in conclusion,
"that grand old man of Colorado, Senator
Henry M. Teller."
Every delegate jumped to his feet and
shouted his approval of- Senator Teller,
as the latter stepped to the speaker's ta
ble. Mr. Towne presented Speaker Teller
with a gavel made from wood taken from
Lincoln's old home at Springfield, 111 .
which was presented to the convention
by Lincoln Dubois of Illinois.
Speaker Teller then delivered an elo
quent address, dealing with the monetary
question and bitterly denouncing the de
monetization of silver. Senator Teller
said:
Questions of foreign and domestlo policies
growing out of or incident to the last Spanish
war have especially attracted the attention ot
the people during the last two years and will
continue to do so, but must not and will not be
allowed to obscure the great and still unsettled
question. "What shall be the financial system
of the republic?
I say still unsettled question because no sreat
economic Question can be settled until It Is set
tled in a way to do Justice to all. We do not
believe the action of the Republican adminis
tration in establishing the gold standard, with
a carefully prepared plan to destroy the green
backs, treasury notes, silver certificates and
silver dollars and to turn over to the national
banks the issue of all paper money that the
commercial needs of the people may demand,
meets with th* approbation of the people. The
people believe that gold and silver coins are the
money of the constitution and that If paper
money is to be issued it should bear the stamp
of the Government and have back of it the
wealth and power of the nation and not that
of a private corporation.
The people believe that the United States
Government Is better able to support, regrulate
and control paper Issue than a. corporation, how
ever rich the corporation may be or how wise
may be its manaeers.
Senator Teller criticised the sold stand
ard legislation of the last session of Con
gress and asked if we should place ob
. stacles in the way of those who search
out hidden riches of the earth and dedi
cate them to the use of mankind. The
Senator, after reviewing the action of the
.Republican convention of 1896 and subse
quent legislation, said:
The Republican party has thrown oft the
mask and no longer pretend3 to favor even in
ternational bimetallism. It Is well that It
should do so. for the pledge of 1896 was made
to secure votes, as was frankly admitted by
leading Republicans as soon as the campaign
wai over. â¢
Refers to the "War Tax.
The Senator claimed that the stimulus
to business experienced in the last few
years was due largely to the increase of
the cold output and the continued produc
tion of silver, thus connrmlng the bl
metallist quantitative theory of money.
He continued:
The Republicans boast that they have reduced
the war debt $40,000,000. They fall to mention
the fact that they have increased the national
bonded debt $200,000,000 before they attempted
to reduce it. Nor do they mention the fact
that they are collecting: an Internal revenua
from the people nearly, if not quite, 1150,000.000
a year more than any other administration did
in time of peace.
He contended that the present prosper
ity was not due to the Republican admin
istration or to the Dingley bill or the gold
standard legislation.
With a United States statute for their
control declared by the highest court of
the land to be constitutional, he said, the
Republican Attorney General declares
that the great trusts are beyond the power
of ?he courts and cannot be restrained in
their work of spoliation of the public. It
was certain no honest effort has been
made by the party in power to control the
trusts or in any way mitigate their per
nicious policy, nor would such effort be
made by that party in the future. Evi
dently trusts were secure while the Re
publican party was in power.
Mr Teller reviewed the war with Spain
and its results, concluding that the refer
ence to the" Philippines, that there "ap
pears to beno way to protect the. peo
nie of these islands, to maintain the peace
of the world, and our own honor, except
to exercise- sovereign power over the* isl
ands until the people could form a gov
ernment of their own. I believe," he con.
tinued. "that public sentiment and the In-,
terest of the people of the islands demand
He had never doubted that it was our
duty to accord to the Filipinos the right
of self-government In their domestic af
fairs. p orto mco Cuba. ,
The Porto RIcan legislation and the ad
ministration's sudden change of front on
that question were criticized and the
speaker continued:
The Republican platform declares, as to the
inhabitants of our new possessions, "the largest
measure of self-government consistent with
their welfare and our duties shall \be secured
to them by law." This is the language of the
despot. "Consistent with their welfare." So ]

KANSAS CITT, July 4.â The contest
over the question of the monetary
ratio, which has been brewing
ever since the delegates to the
convention began to assemble,
found expression in the committee on res
olutions when' it assembled to-day. Sena
tor Jones of Arkansas was unanimously
chosen chairman and Mr. Metcalf of Ne
braska secretary.
Metcalf presented the draft of a plat
form, covering all questions of public in
terest, which draft all the members ac
cepted as Mr. Bryan's expressed opinion
on this question. Giranr'of Georgia also
presented a platform, as did Van Wyck
of New York. All these documents took
practically the same ground on all ques
tions except that of finance. Metcairs
declaration was for the reafflrmation of
the Chicago platform in letter and spirit,
and it emphasized and reiterated specific
cally the declaratloiTfor the free" coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. Both the
other drafts simply reaffirmed the Chi
cago platform without, reference to the
ratio.
Van Wyck led off with a brief statement
saying that while in his platform he had
referred to four issues as prominent,
namely, those of imperialism, militarism,
trusts and the finances, he considered that
only three of these were of current conse
quence, believing that tho money question
had been crowded into the background by
other subjects which had pressed, to the
front during the past four years.
Daniel's Change of Front
Senator Daniel of Virginia, somewhat to
would no longer be any ark of refuge for
the plain people.
Money's Defiance to Bryan.
Senator Money of Mississippi antagoniz
ed the 16 to 1 proposition and said Bryan
had no ricrht to dictate to the convention,
but should be satisfied with a reaffirma
tion of the Chicago platform ,if the con
vention deemed that the wise course to
pursue. He said that while he yielded to
no one in his admiration of Mr. Bryan,
neither Mr. Bryan nor any other man was
big enough to coerce the conscience of the
whole Democratic party.
G. Irving Handy of Delaware took a
position In favor of a reiteration of the
platform instead of a reafnrmation.
"If you reaffirm the platform," he said,
"you will have to include in it an attack
en the Supreme Court, though the Chi
cago riots, which caused that declaration,
are a thing of the past. If we reaffirm
the platform you still declare for silver.
You cau't silence that grea.1 voice in Ne
braska. In tones that are heard from
ocean to ocean will the man you are going
to nominate declare that the Democratic
party Is for free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. without
the consent of any other nation on earch."
Great interest was manifested In tho
speech of Carter Harrison of Chicago.
He went over many arguments that have
been made since the conve: .ion began,
and declared that proper action was to
reaffirm the Chicago platform. Said he:
"We must have recruits or we cannot
win. and we must get them In Indiana.
Illinois and Wisconsin. States which are
ready to leave the Republican party on
other Issues."
Senator Blackburn of Kentucky made a
strong speech for 16 to 1. The Senator
referred in uncomplimentary terms to the
members of the committee who, he said,
were deserting the historic ratio. He was
replied to in spirited language by Sena
tor Daniel of Virginia.
the surprise of some of the members of
the . committee, followed Van Wyck In
support of his views of the question. The
Senator said that no man who knew him
would doubt for a minute that he now
stood where he had stood on the silver
question In '96. and he entertained pre
cisely the same views on the subject
which then controlled him. He was, how
ever, anxious to bring back into the fold
of the party those who had left it four
years ago on account of- the position
taken on the sliver question and if this
could be accomplished, as he believed it
could, by omitting all reference to the
ratio, he, for one, was content to pursue
that course, simply reaffirming the Chi
cago platform.
Fitzgerald of Colorado followed In a
warm speech denouncing in most emphatic
language any effort to minimize the finan
cial question.
"If." he said, referring tojthe platform
presented by Metcalf,. "Mr. Bryan is a
good enough man, then the platform ap
proved by him should be good enough."
.. George Fred "Williams of -Massachusetts
passionately declared he did not believe
in deserting those people who had left
their own partfes to support the Demo
cratic policy of four years ago for the
purpose of regaining the support of the
traitors and trimmers who had left the
Democratic party because of its financial
position.
"There is no reason," he exclaimed, "for
making any concession to treason."
Continuing 1 , he asked: "Are we going to
drive the Populists into the middle of the
road in order to get back the traitors?
Are we going to sell out our principles to
the.tories of the Democratic party, and
desert our real friends?"
He predicted that if this course was to
be pursued the trusts would take posses
sion of the Democratic party as they had
already taken possession of the Repub
i Mean party, and that in that event there

Mr. Richardson repeatedly bowed his
acknowledgments of the cheers that
swept In wave after wave through" the
hall.
The first token of approval given to his
address was that which greeted his first
mention of 16 to 1. The. applause, how
ever, was rather feeble and scattering.
Much more energetic was 'the shout that
followed the declaration that the coming
campaign was -to be . a trial of the re
public against the empire.
The hall had become very quiet by this
time and the address of Chairman Rleh
axdson waa given a much better hearing

of the aisles it. required some little time

Chairman Trfomas then called for the
report of the committee on permanent or
ganization. When it was announced that
Hon. J D. Richardson of Tennessee had
been selected as permanent chairman
cheers swept over the great audience.
The report recommended that Hon. J.
B. Klcnardson of Tennessee be made per
manent chairman of thetonvention; also
that the temporary secretary', assistant
eecretaries, *>ergeant-at-arms, reading
clerks and special officers U-j made thÂ»

in addition, that Hon. Lincoln DIxon of
Indiana, Hon. Jefferson Pollard of Mis
souri, Hon. William Cromwell of Ken
tucky, and Hon. W. F. M. Bernamer of
Illinois be recommended as assistant sec
retaries.
Chairman Thomas, after the adoption of
the report without debate, appointed a
committee consisting of former Governoi
McCreary of Kentucky, Daniel Campau
of Michigan, and Mayor Phelan of San
Francisco to escort the permanent chair
man to the platform.
Cheers for Richardson.

While this strife was going on between
the two States the frenzy had -taken hold
of the other delegations, and from all
parts of the hall- men came plunging
through the throng, carrying their State
emblems. They became densely packed In
front of the speaker's d'esk, and, .yÂ«lling
and cheering like maniacs, they. strove to
raise the names of their States level with
that of New York. The effort was use

raignment of the failure of the Repub
lican party to establish bimetallism and
the creation Instead of a single gold
standard waa received with manifesta
tions of hearty approval.
Wild Outburst for Bryan,
The conclusion of Chairman Richard
son's speech, which he had arranged un
der sixteen separate heads, was the sig
nal for terrific applause and cheers.
His mention of the name of W, J. Bryan
brought the convention to its feet in a
frenzy of excitement. Delegates sprang
upon their chairs, waving hats, handker
chiefs, and umbrellas In the wildest fash
ion. By a common lmpulae the guidons
bearing the names *pf the States were
torn up and thrust Into the air. Then
down the aisles toward the speaker's desk
came groups of delegates surrounding the
man who held the name of their- State
alfift. Texas and New York became en
gaged In a rivalry as to which should
hold the name of the State highest In
the air. The Lone Star State had the ad
vantage at the outset, for the New York
standard had been grasped by one of the
small men of the delegation. This was
quickly remedied when the Tammany
men saw themselves 'in second place. The
pole bearing the name of the State was
grabbed from the small New Yorker, he
was bumped down into his chair, nnd
Kellar, Indorsed by New York for Vice
President, seized lt.^ Kellar put Texas In
second place in a flash and try as desper
ately as he might, the Texan could not
place the name of his State within a foot
of that of New York. Wild with excite
ment, the Texans grasped their man,
raised him on their shoulders and New
York was down againâ but as before it
went down only to rise higher: Richard
Croker, Grady. Carroll and a half-dozen
others of the New York delegation came
to Kellar's aid and the emblem of the
Empire State went up again nearer the'
celling by a foot than Texas had reached.
After the excitement had continued fif
teen minutes Chairman Richardson at
tempted to bring order out of the chaos
that ruled upon the floor.*: Now 'and then
the patter of his gavel .could be heard,
and every time the Â¦ sound . reached : the
ears of a delegate he. shrieked the louder.

to restore q ulet. :< but he was utterly lost
and overwhelmed with each fresh effort.
Half-Hour of Excitement.
failure to equal New York, made a rush
for the epeaker"s stand. They went
through the crowd with a force that no
opposition of the crowd could prevent, and
pushing, shoving, clawing and cheering,
they hoisted their man upon the platform
and lifted him upon a chair. The 'effort
was successful and New York was
eclipsed once more. Kellar Is no small
man to hold aloft In a*crowd of strug
gling, pushing men, and the Tammany
crowd was nearly ready to drop with ex
haustion, but a glance at the Georgia ban
ner brought new strength into their
wearied arms and new determination Into
their hearts, and Mr. Kellar went up still
higher, and New York was on top once
more.
The convention by this time waa In a
state of frantic excitement. The men
from Hawaii, carrying their large banner,
came down the aisle, followed by a
shouting mob which bore all before It.
The band struck up "The Stars and
Stripes," and to these inspiring strains the
men commenced to march around the
floor, yelling like madmen, waving every
thing that could be lifted into the air.
Hats, handkerchiefs, umbrellas. State em
blems, banners and the national colors
were united into. a conglomerate wave,
and beneath It marched a crowd of men
fairly beside themselves with excitement.
With flushed faces, down which the per
spiration rolled in streams, many with
out coats and vests, they went around and
around the hall, shouting, yelUns: and
screaming at the top of their voices.
Those delegates who did not join In the
march lent most effective aid in Increas
ing the uproar. They could contribute
nothing but their voices and their hats
f.nd handkerchiefs, but they used tho first
as though they Were made of brass, and
originally designed for one night's wear
only, and the latter two in a manner fully
as energetic. The band did Its share, and
the tootera of horns and the beaters of
sheepskins worked away for dear 'life.
Nobody knew what they playedâ nobody
cared. They were doing their full Â¦ share,
and that was all that wag necesasry.

BRIGHT OUTLOOK
FOR STEVENSON
Twenty minutes after Chairman Rich
ardson had mentioned theÂ«name of Bryan,
which, like the waving of a magic wand,
had conjured up a scene of such wonder
ful enthusiasm as has seldom been wit
nessed In a political convention, he began
to rap for order, but the delegates were
not yet ready to yield the floor even to
the chairman of the convention. The band
In the gallery started a patriotic air, and,
despite the continuous efforts of Chair
man Richardson to restore order, the
demonstration continued for nine and a
half minutes longer. Its total length being
twenty-nine and a half- minutes.
Order then was sufficiently restored to
enable the chairman to recognize Delegate
J.' Q. Johnson of Kansas, who made a
motion that the convention adjourn untlt
10:30 a. m. to-morrow. At 10:31 the chair
man declared the convention adjourned.

Japan Is reported to be landing an army

Panic at Shanghai.
European and American residents In
Shanghai are quite In a panic over what
is viewed as the inadequate military
preparations of the powers. A dispatch
to the Express from Shanghai says that
according to the best military estimates
500,000 men will be necessary to subjugate
Northern China, and even then it will
take two or three years. The forces of
the Chinese Empire have gathered such
perilous traveling through the disturbed
area. The correspondent of the Dally
Telegraph at" Shimo Hal, telegraphing un
der date of July 3, says that Count Ito in
the course of an interview said the emer
gency had for a moment obscured the
gigantic question in the background It
was desirable, he declared, that there
should be a permanent settlement now
Some of the powers wished to postpone
a settlement because they were not ready
for it, but it was said that England was
not willing to postpone a decision
The morning papers publish editorials
regarding the impotence of the great pow
ers as shown by the inability to save their
Ministers. The Daily Telegraph says
"That any country should desert its Em
bassadors Is recognized as a most signal
dereliction of honor, but that all of the
powers of Europe, with the United States
and Japan, should confess their utter
impotence to save their entire corps dip
lomatique which are still, perhaps, fight
ing during the last hours of their lives
against a savage and brutal horde, seems
more incredible the more completely It is
realized."
According to roundabout reports, It 1b
asserted by the Chinese that Prince Tuan
Is personally directing the â¢ assault" upon
the legation. He conferred honors and
gave large Bums of money and other
Direct tidings from Peking end with the
dispatch sent by Sir Robert Hart on
June 25. . Â¦
Revolting stories are told of barbarities
practiced upon Japanese and European
prisoners captured on the way to Peking,
though it was not known before that Ad
miral Seymour had lost any prisoners.
The Chinese troops marching toward
Tientsin, the Chinese say, left behind
them trails of rapine^ fire and blood. Na
tive women were ravished and children
were cut In two.
Official news received af Chefu shows
that the Chinese have been guilty of hor
rible cruelty toward the wounded and cap
tured, subjecting them to what is known
as "lin che," or the slicing process. Under
this hideous rite the bodies of the fallen
have been mutilated. The Russians are
retaliating by the wholesale shooting of
natives. Tientsin, according to the Ex
press correspondent, shows no signs of
drifting Into barbarism and savagery.
Other advices, received, by way of
Shanghai, aver that the Chinese losses
around Tientsin are between. 7000 and S009
according to official estimates. The corre
spondent cf the Express at Chefu, tele
graphing Wednesday, says Admiral Sey
mour was wounded while sitting in a
house at Tientsin by Chinese sharpshoot
ers.
"SHANGHAI, July 4. 11:10 a. m. (via
Chefu).â Tientsin city fell between 7 and
i o'clock on the morning of June 30 "
It is understood that the dispatch un
doubtedly referred to the native city of
Tientsin, from which the Chinese have
been bombarding the foreign quarters, and
the dispatch is taken to mean that the al
lies are more than holding their own.

taking the offensive, the 12,000 interna

ers at Taku and intermediate points can
barely keep up communications, fighting
incessantly with overwhelming numbers
using far more numerous pieces' of artil
lery than the allies.
"I (eel confident that there will be no

His prognostications of Democratic suc
cess next fail was the signal for another
vocal ;-, ::-!.i . and then he declared that
Jf the .Democrats of the country had not
fcufficienl coniidence in their delegates to
intrust the cau?e of Democracy to them
they would not have sent them here to
nominate a candidate for the Presidency.
This, coining from a man of Mr. Altgold's
known attitude upon the silver question,
wafi taken by the 10 to 1 advocates as a ul
i*-ct championship of their cause, and
th^y were on their feet in an Instam,
fchouting and waving hats ana handker
chiefs: with the greatest enthusiasm. So
loud was the cheering that the speaker
was compelled to suspend hla remarks un
til the uproar had subsided.
It came apain in a minute, however,
v.hen he declared that any modification of
th*> Chicago platform would place th<Â»
lxrnocrntic party in a ridiculous position
before the American people. Again his
voice was drowned for a full minute,
while the advocates of 16 to 1 voiced their
approval audibly beyond the wails.
The enti-16 to 1 people took their innings
Jn another minute, when he spoke favora-
My of the ratio of 1C to 1, and there were
loud cries of "No!" "No!" The speaker
unwittingly touched oft a mine by using
the expression, in discussing the attitude
of certain Democrats toward the silver
question, "Now, my friend Hill.',' That
was a? far an he got for several minutes.
The name of Hill again started the uproar
that had marked the first cession of the
convention. From all sides of the hall.
Bad particularly from the Southern dele
pates, came loud cries of "Hill!" "Hill!"
Mingled with the calls for tho New
Yorker came hisses Jn plenty, and despite
the vigorous use of the Ravel all sem
blance of order was lost and nothing could
J<e heard save the calls of "Hill!" and the
difapproving hisses. The band in the gal
lery struck up a lively air. but as soon i.Â»
it subsided the uproar wan as great aa
ever, the California delegation beir?

was not possible for Governor Altgeld to
continue immediately, and as the commit

During the early part of ex-Governor
AHgf'ld's address the hum of conversation
in the galleries and among the delpgates
was so loud that not much of what he
*=aiJ was audible, except to those close to
him. Th*- name of Mark liantia, uttered
in accent? which did not imply approval,
wan the first thing the crowd at largs
caught, and although not many know just
what the missile had been or whether It
had hit the mark, it was received with a
howl of wild delight.
Convention in an Uproar.
At SÂ«3 o'clock Chairman Thumas rapped
the convention to order, although consid-
Olbly leas than two-thirds of the dele
f-'atts ha<i arrived. There was considera
ble expectancy over the arrival of Sena
ror Hill, but he failed to put in an ap
jvÂ»araÂ»cf.
N'.: withstanding the small number of
delegates present, it seemed to require for
them a uhoily disproportionate amount of

SESSIONS OF
CONVENTION
LONDON, July 5 âThe commanders
of the allies in Tientsin inform the
correspondents that it would be sui
cide to attempt to reach Peking with
the troops now available in the face
of the colossal force of imperial
SHANGHAI, July 4. â Three servants of foreigners have, it is
rumored from a good source, escaped from Peking. They re
port that all foreigners, 1000 in number, including 400 soldiers,
100 members of the Chinese customs staff, and a number of
women and children, held out till their ammunition -was exhausted
in the British legation. The legation was finally burned and all the
foreigners killed.
It is reported that Kwan Hsu and the Dowager Empress have
been poisoned.

of restoring order.
TaGtai Bheng of Shanghai issued a
proclamation on .Wednesday which prac
tically forbids foreign warships approach
ing the Yang-tse-Kiang. saying that if
they do so the Chinese authorities will
.not hold themselves responsible for the
consequences: ' It Is considered the Chi
nese officials are evading the responsibil
ity of an outbreak. Even Li Hung Chang
is suspected. The foreigners are simply
aghast at the extent of the Chinese arma
ments; which have been systematically
accumulated.
The decision of the admirals not to at
tempt the relief of the besieged forces
has tilled the entire European community,
the Daily Mail correspondent sayÂ«, with
bitterness and despair. Few, however,
affirm that any other course, is possible. ,
The weakness of the allied forces left no
other course open. It is pointed out that ,
the Chinese opposing Admiral Seymour
were only a fraction of the huge force
now cutting off the capital from Tientsin
and which number 200.000, nearly all well
armed. The ' allies have no real means
of transport and there is no food in the
country, as it is being laid waste. The
question of ammunition is also a serious
one. Only Japan, and to a less extent
Russia, are able to push up war material
in the vast quantities made necessary by
the continuous fighting.
Fifty Thousand Men Needed.
Though transports will soon arrive at
Taku, the present pressure is not re
moved. The consensus of opinion among
military and naval authorities is that it
will- require at least 50.000 men to rescue
the Europeans in Pekins- The allies have
to hold Taku in strength and the occu
pation of strategic points on the railroad
to Tientsin will be most difficult. Tien
tsin itself is too stronply held.
Among the edicts received at Shanghai
on June 23 were orders for the foreign
Ministers to leave Tientsin in four hours.
The legations were to be sealed up and
the flagstaffs cut down. Another edict
Issued on June 22 announced that Princes
Tuan and Kang-Yi are the supreme chiefs
of the Ihochundl, the Chinese name for
tho Boxers. A dispatch to the Daily Mail
from Chefu. dated July 1. says that W'ei-
Hai-Wei has been placed under martial
law and that no passengers are allowed
to land there.
A dispatch from Shanghai to the Dally
Telegraph, dated July 4, says the Taotai
has received news from Peking to

LONDON, July 5.â The various tele
grams received from Pretoria and' else
where In South Africa, while not giving
an account of fighting, represent the con
verging columns as making Dewet's rov
ing ground more and more contracted and
the possibility of his" defeat and capture
nearer. â¢ Heavy artillery fighting was

train â¢ of fast freight, southbound. The
switch was open and the train ran Into
the sidetrack, colliding with the tank car
The collision caused a hole to be bored
in the top part of the tank and the oil
ignited. This happened a few minutes
after 5 3 o'clock this morning. It made u
fearful fire. Master Mechanic Lalime and
the general superintendent, J. H. Hamil
ton, were called . upon to devise some
means of ridding the track of the burn
ing tanks and extinguishing the blaze.
An effort was made to tip the car over.
There were few people who were close
to the car, as the heat was so intense
that this manner of disposing of the fire
was given up. Pouring water on it had
absolutely no effect. While some of the
men were grouped near the tank after 7
o'clock an explosion occurred. It was
caused by the iire igniting the gaa
that had formed from the burning oil. It
came with a flash of flre and a deafening
report. .?
Some people who were standing near
were not affected by it at all. These saw
the bodies of men flying- in the air and
saw others knocked to the ground by the
concussion as the tank went through the
air. It had parted and went in two di
rections. There were numbers knocked
down by the force of the air. Those who
were killed were struck by the flying end
of the tank which went in Â¦ a southerly
direction. It was 200 yards distant from
the victims and came to sthe ground near
the shops. The piece which went Â¦* fifty
yards In the other, direction killed no one.

The explosion occurred in front of the
small shop of Antonio Mammerello. on
Eisrhth street, a most thickly populated
section. The llreworks were on a stand
on the pavement, and consisted largely
of giant firecrackers, torpedoes, rockets
and "chasers." A crowd of children weri
clustered around the stand. A colored
boy Isaiah Harris, was seen to point the
pistol In the direction of the rireworks

stores and residences in the vicinity, and
the scene was covered by a dense smoke.
When this lifted the forms of more than

bullet entering his lung, while he was
standing at ahe corner of Pacific and
Davis streets last evening. How the af
fair happened no one knows, but It is
surmised that the leaden pellet came from
the revolver of some person celebrating
the Fourth of July. Roach was standing
near the edge of the sidewalk talking to
a man, whose name he does not know,
when he suddenly became conscious of a
stinging sensation in the back. At lirst he
thought some one had struck him and did
not suspect that he had been shot, but the
pain increased and ne nnaliy vi?'ted th e

patriotism to spend the Fourth of July.
Their Journey was nearly at an end when
death Interfered and claimed them as
his own in a most frightful manner. He
gave no iu?rteR. Neither man, woman
nor dlfld'VtLS spared. Crushed, maimed
and mangled the unfortunates were
dragged from beneath the wreck of the
car and tender hands ministered to them
until conveyances could be had to carry
them to hospitals and to the homes of
their friends. The dead were laid on the
grass, but there were few in the crowds
of spectators and rescuers who gathered
at the Fcene at that time who knew who
were dead and who were living. Such a
spectacle of battered, mutilated humanity
has scarcely ever been seen. A former
member of the First Washington Volun
teers, who has played a part on many
battle fields In the Philippines, said he
had never witnessed such a sight before.
Mangted by Debris.
It was a spectacle of carnage such as is
scarcely ever observed in war, for car
wheels and trucks and heavy timbers
make more horrible wounds than bullet
and shell. And the agonizing cries of the
wounded and the dying as they lay on
the sides of the gulch and on the bottom
or were held down under heavy timbers
that had once formed part of the wrecked
car could be heard for blocks away.
There was help at hand a few moments
after the accident occurred. Citizens, po
licemen, Jiremen, guardsmen, ex-volun
teers and women and children aided. The
sides of the gulch are steep, in fact so
steep that a goat would scarcely venture
to descend them, but the cries of the
woundeil made men forget themselves and
they pluriRcd downward without regard
to their own safety. Ropes were quickly
procured and the victims of the wreck
were drawn carefully to the top of the
gulch and their wounds attended to as
fast as it was possible for the physicians
to work. Everj' doctor in the city was
-?- 4> -Â»-$>-*-4 > -Â»-Â§~Â»- < 8> ~*-^-*-^-*-^-*" 9
called on for his services. The Fanny
Paddock and St. Joseph's hospitals were
soon crowded with patients who but a
few moments before were in the enjoyÂ«
ment of their health. Hacks, express
wagons and all sorts of conveyances were
pressed into service; but there was an
other vehicle that was In use. It was the
wagon of the dead. It came to take away
the last evidence of the destruction
caused by the wreck. It made Journey
after Journey and It was always full.
Boys and girls and men and women were
its freight. The morgues of the various
undertaking rooms were i scarcely large
enough to hold all.
Searching for Friends.
And then when the dead had been sort
ed from the living and the last one had
been removed from the wreck excited
men and women and children besieged the
morgues searching for missing friends.
Some were successful in their sad quest
and others who were not successful turned
away with every evidence of joy upon
their faces. Thousands of people visited
the bridge where the accident occurred
during the day. They watched the men
at work clearing away the debris of the
car and looked curiously at the red stains
on the grass and at the tattered pieces
of clothing that hung from bushes.
They glanced, too, at two women, who
wandered about all day. one with a babe
in her. arms and the ether leading a lit
tle boy by the hand. The charges of these
women were foundlings of the wreck. No
body had come to claim them. Perhaps
their mother and their father as well was
dead. But they had found friends and
if nobody a?ks for them their foster moth
ers will probably see that they do not
want. Then there is a little girl of 4 and
a girl babe at the Fanny Paddock Hospi
tal. They seem to be deserted, but It is
probable that some relatives will look af
ter them.

a ride to the city, for, like those inside,
they were anxious to arrive early so as
not to miss any of the Independence day
exercises.
Cause of the Accident.
The car ran merrily along, the passen
gers chatting with each other, for they
were nearly all acquainted, and every -
thing was pleasant until It reached the
apex of the hill just beyond Tacoma ave
nue. From this point the stories differ.
One Is that the motorman, after starting
down the hill, turned on his current In
stead of shutting It off, and when the car
had gained such a momentum as to
threaten to get away from him he turned
off the current, but It was then too late,
for the car was goingr at lightning, speed
and there was nothing to bring It to a
standstill, for the incline is steep. Pas
sengers on the front platform who saw
the sharp curve on the bridge as It leaves
Delln street endeavored to jump. Sev
eral of them, succeeded and reached the
ground in safety, but others were as bad
ly injured as they might have been had
they remained In the car to the bottom of
the chasm.

THE OREGON AFLOAT.
GOOD news and appropriate to the Fourth of
July was given to the public yesterday in the
announcement from Shanghai that the Oregon
had been floated from the rocks on which she struck
off the inland of Hookie and is now safe. As she
cannot be docked at Port Arthur, she will be taken
to some Japanese port. A dispatch to the Secretary
of the navy from Tokio says: "If the Oregon can
not dock at Nagasaki the Japanese Navy Department
tenders the use of either Kure or Yokosuka dock?,
and offers any assistance\ desired." It is added that
one of the most famous cruisers of the Japanese navy
h?.s been ordered to the relief of the Oregon, and as
the voyage to the port where she will dock is to be
over the comparatively quiet waters of Pechili Bay,
there arc no longer any fears of her safety.
There will be no little pleasure to the American peo
ple in this news. OS nil the ships of our new navy the
Oregon is the one which has the most brilliant rec
ord and is most endeared to popular sentiment.- Her
wreck would have been felt as a loss of something
more than the money she cost, and now that she ap
pears td be safe from the danger that threatened her
there will be general congratulation. Moreover, it
will not be overlooked that her mishap has given
another proof of the excellence of the work of Cali
fornia ship-builders. She made the voyage round, the"
Horn and went through the battle. of Santiago with
out straining a plate or starting a rivet, and now it is
proven that even when dashed upon a rock she re
mains stanch and strong
A RESOLUTE MOVEMENT.
OUT of the bubonic scare and the Kinyoun
quarantine there has come a popular demand
for a reform in Chinatown. That was of
course to be expected, for public indignation against
the Health Board and the,- quarantine officer for the
wrong done to the community was keen, but there
was danger it would speedily pass away, and that in
the excitements occasioned by the opening of the
Presidential campaign it would be forgotten. For
tunately the opposite has been the case. So far from
dying out or weakening, the desire of the people for
improving the" Chinatown district has increased, and
the discussion of ways and means to that end goes "on
with augmented force.
It is clear that on this issue the people of San
Francisco have now reached a definite resolve. The
agitation will continue until an active movement for
reform begins and affords satisfaction tohhe people.
That movement it is the duty of the autf orities to at
once undertake. The municipal ordinances have not
yet been enforced in Chinatown. There has been
a neglect of duty on the part of the Board of Health,
of the police and of all having authority on the sub
ject. Every sanitary "regulation of the city is vio
lated in the district, and probably in every building
of the district. Consequently the proper way to be
gin in dealing with the Chinatown problem is to en
force the law.
There ,are signs that the owners of property in
Chinatow'n, who have long been deriving large profit
from buildings maintained in violation of the 'health
ordinances, will endeavor to have the district cleaned
up and the improvements made at public expense.
They will of, course fight as long and as effectively
as they can against any- effort to compel them' to.re
pair and clean their property at their own cost. Such
being the situation, the Grand Jury should at once
begin an inspection of the district in order' that the
offending persons may be brought promptly to an
swer for violations of law. There is no reason why
this phase of the subject should be postponed until
the adoption of some comprehensive plan for im
proving the whole district. 'Let the authorities com
pel every owner of property in Chinatown to put his
buildings in proper condition and, maintain them in
accordance with the health laws of the city, and a
good start will have been made toward a solution of
the whole problem.- ->v^
PURGING THE CLUB ROLLS.
WHEN announcing on Sunday morning the re
sult of the enrollment during the previous
week in the various Republican district clubs
The Call stated that irauds had been perpetrated in
several districts, and specified the Forty-third as one
in which they had been particularly "raw." It is
ti*^fefore gratifying that a complaint has been made
of the fraudulent enrollment, and the County Com
mittee has been called upon to right the wrong.
The complaint states: "We, the undersigned reg
istered voters and enrolled Republicans of the Forty
third Assembly District, hereby enter our protest with
your honorable body that the roll containing signa
tures for the formation of a Republican club, to be
organized on the evening of July 9 in this district,
has upon it not less than 200 names of men who do
not reside in the said Forty-third Assembly District.
Iu consequence thereof the spirit and principle of
your honorable committee has not been carried out.
We. therefore as a matter of justice to the Republican
voters of the Forty-third Assembly District request
you to select at once ten names from this petition to
assist the County Committee in purging said roll of
those who are not entitled to remain Ihereon. In con
clusion we desire to say that the enrollment of 446
names in the Forty-third Assembly District justifies
us in making this protest."
The lead thus given by the honest Republicans of
the Forty-third should be followed in every other
district where there is evidence of fraudulent enroll
ment. Such action will be beneficial to the party and
will save it from the contamination of Kelly and
Crimmips politics. It will be an encouragement to
the better clement of the party to take an active part
in the campaign and to associate themselves with the
clubs organized for campaign work. Moreover, it
will win over a host of independent voters to the Re
publican ticket on election day, and in that way-nia
terially strengthen the chances for the election of
the whole ticket.
The joint committee intrusted with the duty of re
vising the club rolls and hearing complaints as to
errors or frauds in k the enrollment has a serious
responsibility to fa'ce. "It should perform its work
with impartiality and with unflinching honesty.
There should be no compromise with the saloon
bosses and their following of toughs and stuff ers.- ;
Such men arc a menace to Republicanism and to the
community. The Republican, party in San Francisco
has in times past suffered because of a mere suspicion
of compromise with disreputable bosses, and it will
suffer again should the bosses be tolerated in the
party councils. The duty of those in v authority b
therefore plain. Purge the club rolls of stuffers.
Drive out of the party the tricksters who control the
sluffers and directed their fraudulent work. ' Let. the
party be kept clean of the low gin mill politicians, and
we shall have a clean ticket, a dean canvass and a
clean victory. ._ \-

r FOLLOWING closely upon the action of the
proprietors of the Hotel Rowardennan in ex
cluding Hebrews from that place of resort
comes the action of Mayor Phclan at Kansas City
showing toward the Hebrews an animosity more of
ur.Mve still. The policy of the Rowardennan people
i> not peculiar 10 them. A similar course has been
taken by other hotel-keepers, and the matter there
fore was the occasion of no particular comment.
or Phclan' s insulting course toward his fellow
cc*cÂ£atÂ£, Charles Edelman, is, however, something
unparalleled and compels the attention of the press of
California.
However insignificant Mr. Phelan's actions might
be were he a private citizen, they arc matters of im
portance by reason of his ofiicial position as Mayor
li the foremost 013- on the Pacific Coast. An insult
given by an ofiicial of such position to a fellow deic
gatc at a national convention is certain to attract
ivide attention. It will be reported throughout the
Union, and unless it be promptly rebuked and con
demned there may grow up in the East a belief that
among a considerable number of people in San Fran
cisco there prevails something of that senseless anti-
Semite prejudice which has been so disgraceful to
Berlin and to Paris.
With any private personal quarrel the Mayor may
have with Mr. Edelman the public has little or no in
terest. When, however, the Mayor in a public place
sweh as a great national Presidential convention de
liberately slurs a man because lie is by race and re
3:gion a Jew, then the public has something to do
with it. It appears from the reports that Mr. Edel
v.\zv. was addressing the chairman of the California
delegation and making a courteous argument against
a motion presented . by Phelan when the contemp
tuous and contemptible insult was given. The wrong
was therefore openly and publicly done, and San
Francisco has to face the reproach of having a
Mayor whose manners are not sufficiently good to
prevent him from showing before the world so mean
a prejudice and so vulgar a method of expressing it.
Mr. Edelman did not like to make a scene by re
senting with a slap the insult put upon him and his
race. He has the sympathy and the respect of his
fellow delegates with the exception of Phelan. The
people of San Francisco will share their indignation
against the Mayor's action. It is the first time that
a man representing California has ever shown a de
sire to insult a man because of his pee or creed, and
now that the insult has been given by one who rep
resents the State not only as Mayor of its chief city
but as a delegate to the national convention of his
party, it becomes the duty of all fair-minded men to
denounce the action and the motives that inspired it.

MANDOLIN AND GUITAIV-Y. I*,
City. Whether a young lady should learn
to play the" mandolin or the guitar Is a.
matter which should be judged by The
young lady herself, it being a matter of
taste which of the two Instruments sha
prefers. As to the sweetness of music
produced by these instruments opinion
varies with various people. As an Instru
ment to accompany those who sing bal
lads the guitar is preferable. The adapt
ability of a person to comprehend mnsle
has much to do 'with the ease with which,
the person can learn to play either In
strument.
ADDING A NAME-R. V.. Glen Ellen.
Cal. The law of California provides how
a person may change the family name, if
there Is good reason for so doing 1 , but is
silent on the subject of adding a name to
precede the family name. It often hap
pens that there are two persons of exactly
the same name in a place, and that leads
to confusion, so they meet and one agrees
to add a name or initial. For Instance, tf
there should be two John Smiths In the
same place an1 in the same line of busi
ness, one would add William, and call
himself John William Smith.

VOTING â Subscriber. Modesto. Cal.
There is no State In the Union that by
express law "deprives negroes of the right
of voting." Such law would be in direct
contravention of the constitution of tho
United States, article XV. which declares
that "the ripht of citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States, or by any-
State, on account of race, color or pre
vious condition of servitude." The quali
fications of voters, however, are subject
to the control of the respective States,
and they vary, as for Instance, time of
citizenship, ability to read the constitu
tion, ownership of real estate and pay
ment of a tax within a stated period, in
some of the States where there are many
negroes some of the negroes do not pos
sess the qualification, consequently they
car.not vote.
ing the light of publicity upon their authors. ' : â¢â¢"
Following- the analogy between the press and the individual as" members of the same
social body, we ask what would be thought of an individual, moral and upright himself,
and of good example, who was. aware, by facts daily before him, of the gross acts of a
heartless lecher, whose lust respected neither the ties of kinship nor the trust of parents,
but whose reptile acts were plied as a vocation, leaving .in his path tears, pain, remorse, #
shame and sullied lives, where he had found purity, morality j and that happiness which
waits upon virtue, and yet extended to him that recognition and that countenance which
served simply to enlarge his opportunity to wreck more lives? [
Will any one say that such an indifferent individual is doing .his duty . to society?.
Will any one ;;ffirm that his skirts are clear of the guilt which has flourished because he
has not rebuked it, and by exposure given warning to the unwary?
If he see such a monster plying his arts upon youth, innocence and purity, and make
no sign, does he not share with the tempter the guilt of the victims' undoing?
We think he does. We think that if the pulpit have such knowledge and raise no
warning, then the pulpit has upon it the scarlet of all the sin and shame that follow. Re
member that when the individual or the pulpit gives warning it is giving publicity to the
offense. It is publishing as far as either can reach that the betrayer is abroad on his errand
of debauchery, turning life's best bloom to canker and rust.
Now when a newspaper feels exactly the same responsibility, and sees with its thou
sand eyes the destruction of virtue and purity, and hears with its thousand ears the groans
and sighs and mortal struggle of the victims, shall it keep silent or shall- it speak?
Remember that when it speaks it is for exactly the same purpose that the individual
and the pulpit speak. Its motive is the same as theirs. The only difference is that. its com
mand of publicity is greater.
When pulpit and individual speak in such a case, does society, the beneficiary of their
warning, repudiate them and turn a smiling welcome and warm embrace to its de
stroyer, against whom it is warned? Does any father, when a friend has warned him that a
certain man is an unfit associate for his daughter, repudiate that friend and invite the lib
ertine to his table? Certainly not. Then why should not the wider warning of a news
paper get the thanks of all who would keep sacred the personal purity of society?
The Call submits these reflections to San Francisco. This paper has seen ruin follow
ruin, and victim following victim fall under more than hellish arts that- have been plied by
wiles and wine; it has seen the altar-bound ties forgotten and the obligations of nature
wiped out, and sin. sorrow and shame left in the track of a moral leper. We felt that to
keep silence would put us in the company of the individual and the pulpit that forgot duty
and made now sign, nuder the same circumstances and in possession of the same knowl
edge. We spoke in the only way in which a newspaper can speak.. ;
These offenses cannot be condoned by talking about the peccadillos of men 'of-, the
world. They are peculiar in being the steady pursuit of some. Men of the world not often
cast heart and conscience behind them, and they but seldom lay siege to unconsciousjn
nocence.

facets which are not perhaps observable
to him who sees it but once. I have also
met all kinds of critics, Christian, Jew,
analytical and learned, ignorant and

bish.
I have met non-Jews who didn't like
the play because they hated Jews and
refused to admit them even the homely
virtues its action shows. These mafia
against the play, but In a reasonable con
sideration they have no court standing.
We may dismiss A. P. A.'s and anti-Sem.

They are of the same plane as the Box

I have met Christians who hated Zang

1READ the article of Rabbi Nieto in
The Call this morning, and it has sug
gested to me that some glossary seems
to be needed for the Interpretation of
my intention in my remarks of Monday
evening.
The fact that I was compelled on that
occasion to speak my own words rather
than the author's was my misfortune.
Zangwill, whether one like? him or not,
speaks with no uncertain note,- and my
language must have been obscure indeed
if I was understood to apply the epithet
"snob" to all his critics.
The Eastern criticism of "The Chil
dren of the Ghetto"' wa3 on the lips of
"the man in the street" when I got here.
It was a condition and not a theory which
I combated, and I am free to say It was a
personal feeling for Mr. Zangwill, whom
I am proud to call my friend, which
lndved me .to try to' discount In some
measure the very active endeavors of hl3
enemies to prejudice the public In ad
vance. Tn addition I had a personal
feeling for Mr. Frawley, who had liked
the play In Xew York, and who at great
risk and some cost had stood by his dis
agreement with the New York verdict.
It may be that I am incompetent to
judge of the religious aspect of the play,
but since some non-Jewish critics of the
East have damned . the playâ not from
the standpoint of dramatic construction,
but on the ground of its "offense to the
Jews" â it seemed to me fair that another
non-Jew should equally be allowed to ex
press a different opinion. If I made any
criticism of the acting of the play I am
sorryâ on the ground of taste only. I io
not believe that an artist is debarred
from opinions on his art or its expression.
Other things being equal he know3 more
about It than the public. I do not re-,
member that I made any allusion to the
cast, except in one Instance, and that was
?ersonal and not in reference to the play,
n my residence with this play (some
eight months) I have grown to find some
it because the Jews "might not like it."
I have met the Jewish snob who objected
to the play because it treated of the Jew of
poverty, of strujrKle. wretchedness, ifmoâ
rance perhaps; or who objected because
all of the. characters were not poetic
selection of special types fitted for a pros
pectus of Utopia.: who dreaded the light;
who didn't believe enoujch in their people
and in the ultimate balance in their favofÂ»
of arithmetical and repcrtorial statement
of fact. %
Genius Is compelling. It lsÂ» because
ZanRWiil is a genius that he must put
down the story as he saw It. without
glossing Shosshi. who was the fool of the
Ghetto: without palliating or softening
Plnehas. who was its knave. The Shosshi
Is farcical because silly fellows provoke
contemptuous laufjhter; Pinchas because
egomaniac* are grotesque to any well
balanced miml.
There are such characters In the Ghetto.
There are tricksters and shrews and fool
ish girls and silly lovers as -well as the
"Hannah" and "Shcmuel." The hypo
crite Pinchas and the loud Sam Irvine
push their way into public notice and pub
lic criticism. It is the Shrinuel whose du
ties and whose studies keep him in the
Ghetto: It is the Hannah, most poetic em
bodiment of filial love, wno have been In
troduced to the public by Mr. Zangwill!
I have never met a decent non-Jew who
did not leave the theater with a better
opinion of the poor Jew of the Ghetto,
whose faults are so patent and whose vir
tues of soul so little known.
Then there is another critic who objects
to the play because it does not conform to
his memory of the construction of other
plays. That, as Mr. Kipling says. 1Â» an
other story! The movement of the drama
will reckon with him sooner or later (I
think). However, he has a right to his
conventions and I hope he Is a thoughtful.

Wilton Lackaye Replies To Rabbi Nieto.
THE time has come to say something to this community upon the place and function
of the newspaper in society. We by no means magnify the press. We do. not as
cribe to it the obsolction of the pulpit, nor of the schools, nor claim that it assumes
the duties of the individual conscience. But we do feel that the press is on equal standing
with the pulpit, school and individual conscience in guardianship of the purity and morals
of society. Without insisting that all newspapers take this view of their duty -and place,
and painfully aware that too many become the promoters of immorality, -we- must 'still
remind the public th.it in that respect newspapers are exactly like men and women, many
of whom are conspiqious moral forces, teaching by example and precept; while some are
promoters of vice. The latter are dangerous in proportion to their social position, just as
a newspaper that may be socially classed with them is dangerous by reason of its com-
Making no pretenses at all, The Call has felt impressed by its duty to the society of
this community, and its impression has been felt and its path discerned on the side of
those who believe that certain gross acts and crying wrongs are exterminable only by turn-

VISITED BY ROBBER
Manager R. V. Halton of the San Rafael
Hotel was at first Inclined to doubt the
story told by McCue, but after interview
ing all of the men concerned now gives
full credence to it.
"Before I let the fellow go Hoffer
brought a light and I saw that the robber
was a middle-aged man, with a mustache
and a three-days' growth of whiskers on
his face. * He was baldheaded, too, and
looked so pitiful that I hadn't the heart
to hold him and turn him over to the po
lice. ' I didn't see him with the knife, but
I found it on the floor beside my bunk
afterward. He must have had It about
him when he tackled me and I must have,
by a fortunate chance, knocked it out of
his hands."
"When he tried to pull my pants from
under my pillow." said McCue yesterday,
"I woke up and grabbed him. It was
pitch dark and I yelled to Hoffer to get a
light, while I rolled out of my bunk and
grappled with him. He was pretty strong
and we wrestled out into the hall ana
along to the stairs. I intended to throw
him down, but when he said, .'For God's
sake, don't hurt me, for I'm an old man
and was only looking for a bite to eat and
a place to sleep,' I Just had to let him go.
If I'd known he tooK that money and gun
I'd have held onto him and got that $25

loafers around the place."
with Hoffer on the second floor. In order
to reach the room the burglar must either
have forced the door or have climbed up
a ladder left leaning against the house
and then' through an open window. He
first went to Koeline's room and took the
silver cleaner's trousers out into the hall,
where he dropped them after emptying
the pockets. Â¦ -
JACK McCUE, second porter at the
Hotel Rafael, had a desperate
struggle with a burglar In his. room
at the hotel very early yesterday
morning, in which he succeeded in disarm
ing thÂ» intruder, who had a knife, and In
putting him to flight. McCue could have
captured and secured the robber, but, be
cause he is good-hearted and the fellow
begged for life and liberty on the ground
that he was old and hungry, permitted
him to go free.
The burglar- was evidently out for a
wholesale haul, for he succeeded in rob
bing two men before he became involved
with McCue, securing a new 32 caliber re
volver from McCue's room mate, Charles
Hoffer, and *3 80 from Tim Koeline, a sil
ver cleaner sleeping In an adjoining room.
He got away with the revolver and
money, but left behind him his hat and
a bowle knife, which are now in the hands
of Town Marshal John Healy of San Ra
fael. . Marshal Healy and his deputy,
George Agnew, scoured the hills for the
robber yesterday but without result. From
the description given by the men who saw
the robber. Marshal Healy has reason to
fear that he may be insane and therefore
a dangerous man to be at large, particu
larly as he is now armed with a pistol.
McCue says he thinks it was about 2:30
a m when he was suddenly awakened by
feeing his Pillow sliding from under bis

"ervants of the hotel, in a bunkhouse in

HORRORS OF
ARMY HOSPITALS
IN TRANSVAAL
"With no further equipment than a* few
marquees and a few bell tents, no addi
tion of staff or anything else, there were
316 patients, of whom half were typhoids.
Their condition was almost indescribable.
The tents were bell tents, such as were
mentioned in a former letter as affording
sleeping accommodations for six to eight
orderlies when working In sound health.
In many of these tents were ten typhoid
cases, lying 'closely packed together, dy
ing against convalescent, patient in his
crisis pressing against a man hastening
to it. There was no room to step be
tween. Think of this, you who know the
sort of nursing a typhoid patient requires!
With no bed or mattress and only forty
two stretchers in the whole hospital, it
followed that 274 patients had to be on
the earth:; There was a great scarcity of
blankets, and no patient could have more
than one, with water-proof sheet between
his body and the ground. The ground i3
as hard as stone, and at night the tem
perature falls to the freezing point. Be
sides other deficiencies which cannot be
described, there were no sheet or pillow
cases or pretense of bed linen of any kind.
Only a coarse rug grated against sensi
tive skin/burning, with fever.* The heat
of these tents in the midday sun was
overpowering, their odors sickening. Men
lay with their faces covered with flies in
black clusters, too weak to raise a hand
to brush them off, trying In vain to dis.
lodge them by painfully twitching their

stances of the state of things there on
April 27. From morning till night gloomy
processions followed each other across the
market square, .with arms reversed, with
shapeless figures sewn in blankets and
crowded, to unknown graves in the ceme

week after week, in ever growing num

terrible speculation, which must be left
to those who consider the conditions at

this ware. was introduced Into Italy under
the name of majolica. This Mezza majol
ica was superseded in the early sixteenth
century" by the true majolica, famous for
its remarkable iridescent brilliance of
orangs, yellows, blues and greens; for
this ware Raphael and his pupils made
many designs. It is Interesting to note in
this connection that modern Florentine
workshops have v revived recently :he old
Urbanese majolica and are successfully
reproducing its exceptional artistic excel
lence.
Luca della Robbia (140O-14S1) discovered
a tin enamel of peculiar fineness and
whiteness which was kept a family secret
until 1507. In common with his nephews
and grandnephews he produced many ex
quisite terra-cotta reliefs, which, coated
with white tin enamel and enriched with
vari-colored glazes, form a unique monu
ment to the genius of this rarely gifted
family. Girolamo della Robbia, grand
nephew of the inventor of the famous
stanniferous enamel. Introduced it into
France (1516), where, at Nevera, was madt*
ware similar to that of Urbino. By re
peated experiment the celebrated Bernard
Palissy also discovered a tin enam-l
which made all the elaborate pieces com
ing from his pottery famous for their brtl -
liancy and purity.
Earthenware seems to have been mads
in England as far back as the reign of
Edward I. in the thirteenth century.
"While many early examples of Stafford
shire slip, such as posset pots, ptgglna
and plates manufactured as early as 1660.
are still found in England, the method of
pressing different colored slips into moid)
was not perfected until a century later,
when WhieMon and Wedgwood produced
the famous queen's ware and jasper ware.
Meanwhile Dutch and Portuguese trad
ers had brought home that translucent
porcelain called, from the country in which
it was dicovered, China. Its imitation at
Delft, with its soft, cobalt, underglaze
blue, is too well known to need much com
ment. It was speedily exported in vast
quantities to all parts of Europe and Intro
duced into England In 1676. That English
importations of china were rare, even in
the time of Queen Elizabeth, is shown by
the mention in the inventory of her valued
gifts of a "poringer of white porselyn and
a cup of green porselyn." Many curious
superstitions surrounded the first pieces of
Oriental ware, one of the most popular be
ing that china Instantly showed the pres
ence of poison In any liquid with which it
came in contact. Shakespeare refers to
the ware but once, in "Measure for Meas
ure." It may simplify matters to remem
ber that tea and the dishes necessary for
its service became_plentlful in England at
the same time (1630) and from the same
place. As specimens of the varieties of
the European china manufactured since
that time have found their way in goodly
numbers to America, its development may
as well be studied from the pieces brought
hither by the colonists as in th.e place of
its manufacture.
It is frequently asserted that the Pil
grim fathers brought with them many
samples of the ware manufactured in the
city from which they set sail, but as at
that time delft ware graced only the ta
bles of the Dutch aristocracy it is unlikely
that it was even a temptation to the fru
gal Pilgrim housewife. It was afterward
brought over in considerable quantities by
the Dutch settlers around New York, who
did not value it very highly, and frequent
ly traded it off to their New England
neighbors.
The plow to-day is constantly turn
ing up rude specimens oÂ£ the pottery of
the North American Indian, whose wares
were buried with him that he might use
them in the happy hunting ground, and
in the excavations from the tombs and
ruined cities of prehistoric peoples are
found numberless examples of the uni
versality of the potter's art. Probably
the tinest of these exhumed relics are
those of the early Greeks, whose vases,
so Justly renowned for their beauty and
form, were but the natural manipulation
of a fine earthenware in the hands of an
artistic people, heirs to the noblest tra
it is difficult among the multiplicity of
utensils of the twentieth century to real
ize the importance of the vase in olden
times. Indispensable to the Greek In his
every-day lite, the vase and its kindred,
known as amphorae, were used for hold
ing wine, water, oil and food, for adorn
ment of the home and for burial in the
tomb. These vases, distinguished by their
exquisite grace of shape and vari-colored
raised slips or glaze of black, cream or
red, upon which was incised black sil
houettes or paintings of mythological sub
jects, show seven distinct stages of his
torical progression, ranging from the
tenth century B. C. to about 200 B. C.
Probably the best-known type Is the
black-figured amphora or the more grace
ful dancing figures adorning an amphora
a century later. Many examples of this
ware, modified later by Roman Influence,
have been found In England on the site
of Roman stations. This red-glazed pot
tery, known as Samian -ware and distin
guished for its enrichment by scroll and
festoon, was not only Imported into Eng
land by the Romans, but judging from
the molds and kilns occasionally found,
was doubtless made there by Roman pot
ters, following Caesar's invasion of Brl-Â»
The Arabs also manufactured a most
artistic pottery, known as lustered ware
or golden pottery, which they introduced
into Spain about the twelfth century. Its
brilliant iridescence and great variety of
'ornamentation caused it to be greatly
"prized by popes, cardinals and princes of
this world, who were astonished that such
noble works could be made of clay.
The Arabian and Persian potters also
manufactured upon the island of Majorca
an earthenware coated with a stannifer
ous or tin glaze called '/enamel. After
Under the general name of ceramics
(from the Greek, keramos, potter's clay)
might be loosely included all branches of
plastic art formed by molding, modeling
and baking clay. With the connoisseur,
however, the lines are drawn more strict
ly, and pottery proper is understood to
include only stoneware and enameled or
glazed earthernware, such as the Majol
ica and Delia Robbia ware of Italy, the
faience of France and the delft ware of
Holland, while porcelain is of a far more
translucent composition of china clay,
generally characterized by a glassy frac
ture, a clear ring and resistance to fire,
water and almost all acids. Clay is a
materialso generally distributed over the
face of the earth, and its plastic possibil
itiesâits adaptability to the most refined
and appropriate forms, together with its
affinity for fine glazes and enamelsâ have
been so generally recognized even by the
most primitive savages that the potter's
art seems to have been intuitive.

James Taylor Rogers delivered an ad
dress last night before a meeting of the
Social DemocratsÂ«at the Temple, 117 Turk
street, on the subject "Government Based
on Natural Right." The speaker read a
portion of the Declaration of Independ
ence and asserted that the country had
departed from principles there set forth
in its treatment of the Philippines and
Porto Rico. He referred to the tramp
problem, and raid the cause lay in laws
which give the few the right to take toll
out of the fruits of the labor of the
masses. True liberty consists, he assert
ed in the right of untrammeled thought,
the right to take part in the government
and the right to enjoy all the fruits of
one's own labor.
"In the new government." the speaker
said. 'Two broad principles will be recog
nizedâthe law of association, of co-opera
tion, and the necessity of serving one's
fellow men in order to be truly happy."

California!!' Defeats Michael in a
McFABLAND'S VICTORY.
The annual race of the California Yacht
Club for the Wallace trophy was won yes
terday by the holder, E. F. Sagar's sloop
Edna, which repeated her victory of the
previous year. The Edna was sailed by
her owner, and beat her nearest compet
itor, the bIoop Thelma, by 2 minutes 46
seconds corrected time. J. T. Carrier's
sloop Jessie E, which had been expected
fto give the Edna a very close rub. If not
actually to beat her, did not round the
Preeldlo Shoal buoy, and was therefore
out of \hn race. The owner of the Jessie
E, hoping to Improve her speed, had add
ed three feet to her bowsprit, thus enlarg
ing her jib, and had cut down the hoist
of the mainsail, causing her racing length
to be little less than before. But the al
teration in her rig, though it gained for
her a email time allowance, spoiled her
sailing qualities. . . -
The course was from the southerly pier
head of the narrow-gauge mole at Ala
meda to and around Presidio Shoal buoy
and back." Of the eleven yachts entered,
the sloop Secret and the yawl Royal were
in the 30-foot class and the other nine in
the 36-foot class. The 30-footers' starting
time was 1:20 p. m. and that of the 36
f ooters was 1:30 p. m. The yawl , Royal
crossed the starting line 1 minute and 36
seconds, and the sloop Secret 2 minutes
and 42 seconds, after gunfire." Of the 36
footers the sloop Gypsle crossed first, fol

A VICTORY IN
TENTH INNING
Hot, Fervid Baseball Which
Keeps a Big Crowd in
a State of Nervous
Expectancy.
San Francisco 4, Stockton 3.
Heartbeats could be heard all over the
recreation Park stands and bleachers
yesterday during the last few innings of
the frame. Of such a close yid exciting
DAture was this mix-up between Stockton
and San Francisco that an extra round
was necespary to close the game.
Almost as hot as the diamond itself was
this trn-innir.g; maich. "Jack" Bonnet,
Just to show his artistic taste and bizarre
ratriotism. had the diamond studded with
fiags in iime-coloml wash and tomato
can-label effects about the glorious
Fourth. The infield looked like a pin-pool
table in colors. The game was very much
of the same order with fireworks by the
spectators and occasional pyrotechnic dis
plays by the men in the field. In the
Â« ighth inning Stockton shoved a pair of
its stickers over the plate, taking the ad
vantage by a single run. In the nipth
the score was tied and in the tenth 'Frisco
won out.
Hot. fast baseball. Just like the weather
and ilÂ»e day. was the story for two ln
r;!ngs. In the third, after two men had
1-erished, Whalen swatted the ball to the
center field fence and did not rest until he
was on the second bag. Streib followed
with a base on balls, and then Babbitt
found the same spot on the center field
lence, scoring Whalen. but Streib was
caught between third and home and the
Fide retired. The loca!s were on the ra
zor's edge of doing something in this in
ning, but the two hits of Iburg and Hllde
brand wÂ«_nt for naught.
The fifth was a section of Fourth of July
fur Hank's men. Reilly earned the first
lag on a hit to center and went to second
on I burgs sacrifice, reaching third on
J^ockhcad's error, which also gave Brock
hoff a retting place on first. Then Hilde
brand lolled out a hit. scoring Reilly and
giving Brockhoff a chor.ee to die at third,
liildetirand worked a steal and went tc
third on bad throwing. The Schwartz
t"uk a jog to first and on his steal at eec
ond liildebrand scored. Sullivan's out
sect the locais to the benches with the
fcc-nre 2 â 1 in their favor.
In the eighth Stockton overlapped 'Fris
co and Hank's vision became packed with
murky cLouds. Schwartz, the steady, er
rored a few times when there were two
outs and after Lockhead swatted the ball
to the flagpole for a three-bagger. Lock
hoad scored and Pace safe at first stole
second on the second error of Schwartz.
'Jinn ICrug tacked on an error when Ms-
Cartbv rolled the ball to him and Pace
soured. Courtney flew to Rube and the
score was Â£â 2 in Stockton's favor.
AH kinds of palpitations came with the
ninth that tied the score and prolonged
the game. Krug hit to short and reached
Jirst and was soon after sent to the sec
ond station on Reiily's sacrifice. When
Jburg struck out things looked blue foi
liar.k, but then Urockhoff had a swallow
of luck when Babbitt failed to 6top his hot
one, Krug scoring on the play. Hilde
brand's out ended the inning.
In the tenth Lockhead made first on a
hit and second on Pace's out. McCarthy
and Moore followed and then up came the
Hankites. Schwartz, who was responsible
fur the extra inning by his error in the
seventh, let loose for a two-bagger. Sul
livan flew to Lockhead. Pabst's hit to left
made the ecore 4 â 3 and the game was
ever. The score:

STOCKTON HAS A
DOUBLE CELEBRATION
STOCKTON, July 4.â Never In the his
tory, of the State outside of San Francisco
has there been such a celebration of the
Fourth as was witnessed here to-day.
The only question debated was as to
whether or not it waa not too elaborate
an affair for a city of this size. But the
city contained it all and to-night the peo
ple are engaged in the final wind-up. The
day had a double meaning, marking as it
did the close of the free street fair and
the nation's birthday. The day opened
to the roar of artillery and closed In a
blaze of light. Ten thousand people
thronged the streets and not one was dis
appointed, for, strange to say, the day'3
events not only equaled but exceeded the
advertised programme. In the morning a
liberty tree was planted in Independence
Square. Major E. A. Sherman made the
address and hundreds of school children
dressed In white sang the national an
them. The great event of the day. how
ever, was the great parade.
For one hour the various divisions
marched past the grand stand and
through the crowded thoroughfares. The
variety held the undivided interest of the
throngs from first to last. Three hundred
and fifty marines from Mare Island under
Lieutenant Flechter led the first division.
They were accompanied by their marine
band. The Veteran Keserve of Oakland,
the Veteran* Reserve of San Francisco,
the Grand Army of the Republic, Sixth
Regiment. National Guard, and other mil
itary organizations followed. The Mex
ican War veterans, the Odd Fellows and
Pythians were finely represented by their
drill corps. The Hebcfcah Drill Corps
made a fine showing. The Chinese divi
sion, in which was carried the great dra
gon from Los Angeles, attracted much
attention. The Mongols did themselves
proud and their magnificent display was
6y manvj regarded as the finest spectacu
lar division of the parade. A hundred
organizations were rppresented either by
marching corps or floats. The pageant
was complete In every detail and when
countermarching on Ei Dorado street was
found to be a full mile and a half in
length.
Mjss Genevieve Peters, the late queen,,
appeared as the Goddess of Liberty, rid
ing on a magnificent float. Mrs. Ture
man's kindergarten made a pretty scene
on various floats representing babylaml
stories. Last in the parade came Commo
dore Stockton's guns. It was fully 1
o'clock before the parade was ttlsbande<l
on Hunter Plaza. In the afternoon the
formal ceremony of delivering Commodore
Stockton's Kun3 to the city of Stockton
took place. Major E. A. Sherman made an
address dealing with the historical fea
tures." Congressman Marlon de Vries spoke
on behalf of ,the Secretary of the Navy
In formally delivering the guns, and Hon.
S. D. Woods accepted on the part of the
city. An elaborate series of tableaux com
pleted the stage ceremonies.
This evening was "all fools' night" and
the name Is no misnomer. Thousands are
out in mask and King: Pin Lewis was on
the throne again In all his glory. There
was a general whoop-up all over the city
and all liberty possible was allowed the
merry maskers, who generally refrained
from any overbolsterous conduct. The night
festivities closed the street fair and It
is now in order for a week's commenting
and explaining how all the x-azious things
happened. It is thought that the receipts
of the fair will meet al! the expenses in
curred by the executive committee' in pro
viding this great nine days' entertainment
for the people.

BOMBARDMENT OF
HEAVENS CLOSED
THE CELEBRATION
The parade was a very satisfactory af
fair, not long enough to be tiresome,
bright and plea*!r!g to the eye and splen
didly managed. People who turned out
to se? it were able to return home In
ample time for luncheon, with the com
fortable feeling that they had eeen every
thing ihere was to be seen. The tardiness
of the Native Sons' division came near
spoiling the schedule, but when they did
arrive at the place of formation Grand
.Marshal TVarfleld had everything so Â¦well
la hand that the march was commenced
without a minute's further delay, and the
natives had to fall la without a chance
to rest.
Promptly at 10:30 o'clock the Balute of
twenty-one guns from The Call building
grave the signal for the start. At that
time the Native Sons division was just
arriving et the place of formation, but an
aid of the grand marshal quickly turned
them Into a side street, and bafore the
puns had ceased booming the company of
mounted police, undtr the command of
Captain Thomson, swung Into Market
ptreet at Battery, to clear the wav for
the pageant. The police drum and bugle
corps fell In close behind them and en.
livened the proceedings with a long roll
or two that set everybody within hearing
to stepping.
The Bbowtac made by the police was
most creditable. Chief of Police Sullivan
rode at the head of two companies of pa
trolmen, commanded by Captains Witt
man and Splllane, respectively, who
marched like weil-drilled soldiers, ana
made an excellent impression on the spec
tators. Further splendid discipline among
the police was ehown in the manner In

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"The American Eagle' at the Golden
Gate." designated as "a personal inter
view," was read by Professor E. Knowl
ton. The poem was original and elicited
much favorable comment.
"W. J. Hynep entertained the audience
with several humorous selections. He said
he had heard the reading of the Declara
tion of Independence. He- had heard the
sentences that granted man certain in
alienable rights, but he had heard nothing
about woman, unless that section referred
to her that granted the people the right to
"bear arms." He had been to several func
tions and had eeen the ladles exercise this
right In addition to' the rested right to
wear low corsage*.
An a nation we rest secure In our present lat
itude* of profit and p*>aee. The American peo
ple will never lose their all-pervadlne love of
country, and remaining In our own continental
stronghold we wilt be substantially unassail
able, and cur toiling masses will carry no sol
diers on their backs. We will be terrible in
battle and beneficent In peace. The "Rockets'
red glare and bombi bursting In air" will each
year renew the lieht i that shone when hope
was born. Let uÂ« be Just before we are char
itable, and let us remember that the Bret power
in secular prosperity might for all that be a
nation of dyinc hearts.
Charles E. Sweigert, orator of the day,
was presented to the audience by Chair
man Wilson. With clear voice and uncon
strained manner Mr. Sweigert approached
his subject. He spoke of the achievements
of our revolutionary fathers, which gave
to the world a ration whose principles will
live until the end of time.
After alluding to the influx of the Japa
nese, whom he said were thriving "like
mandarins on the white man's starving
wages, and referring to the Boer war as
a gallant struggle against the domination
of despotismâ a struggle that commanded
the respect and sympathy of all liberty
loving peoples, the speaker concluded his
oration as follows:

He started in with Grape-Nuts break-

coflec and took Postum Food Coffee in
its place. He writes that he has been
put right, perfectly well, and going to
remain so by continuing the use of the
Grape-Nuts food and Postum Coffee.
It is v.orth any one's trial, who desires
to be well, to change the diet, and par-

AMERICAN SHIPS
MAKE THE FINEST
SHOWING IN YEARS
Captains Got Men Together
and Decorated Their
Vessels Splendidly.
The water front saved the city yester
day in the matter of decorations. Never
before has the shipping shown up in such
splendid colors. Strange to say, the
American fleet loomed up In a manner
that should make Uncle Sam proud.
On this occasion the captains "took a
tumble," and there was hardly an Ameri
can ship on the front that was not decked
from stem to stern. Particularly noticea
ble were the. bark Santiago at Howard
street pier No. 3 and the Robert Lewers
at Mission 1. Out In the stream the trans
port Grant had all her bunting thrown tp
the morning breeze, while the training
ship Adams was similarly decked. ' The
Grant with General Chaffee and the men
of- the Sitxh Cavalry sailed during the
morning, while later in the day the Ad
ams .went over to the naval station at
Goat Island. The Naval Reserve steamer
Marlon remained ' at her anchorage all
day, . however, and Berved as an object

At Pacific-street wharf . the German
steamer Serapis and the British steamer
Moana made a splendid showing. During
the evening both vessels gave an -xhibi
tlon of fireworks that was one of the
features of the day. On the Moana a
number of signal rockets were fired. They
made a most Impressive showing.
From Meiggs wharf to the Mall dock
every vessel showed her colors, and from
the stream the w^ter front seemed to be
one mass of fluttering flags throughout
the day. /
PATRICK J. CURTIN. the detective
who is accused of having held Mrs.
Le Blanche while her husband shot
her last Monday night, surrendered
himself to the police yesterday and was
charged with assault to commit murder.
He was later released on $3000 bonds. Cur
tin still strenuously denies having acted
the part attributed to him. He admits he
shadowed the woman to the Webb House
and notified the husband, but claims he
had no complicity in the attempted mur
der.
A statement was made'in a morning
paper that Captain Seymour saw Judge
Conlan and told him that there was no
necessity for him to Issue a bench war
rant for the arrest of Le Blanche. Judge
Conlan last night positively denied the
statement and said the man who wrote
it clearly mlsunderstoo<l\him. Captafn

comments of the Judge and visited his
courtroom with a view to securing an ex

Crowds Gather at the An
nual Reunion at Schuet
zen Park
The patrJotic celebration, excursion and
picnic of the Ancient Order of Hibernians
in America drew over 7000 people to
Schuetzon Park, San Jiafael, yesterday. It
took six trains of twelve cars each to
convey the crowds of merrymakers to the
pleasure grounds. State Chaplain Rev. D.
O. Crowley, assisted by a committee of
members, "were untiring in their efforts
to insure the pleasure of their guests and
full well did they succeed.
Arrived at the park the excursionist*
set about indulging: In the various amuse
ments on the grounds and the dancing in
the pavilion. After luncheon Father
Crowley led the procession of pleasure
seekers, headed by the band, to an adja
cent hill, where the open-air programme
was carried out. After an overture of
patriotic selections Father Crowley wel
comed the quests on behalf of the order
In a feeling' manner. He said it was
JUting for Erin's sons to gather under
the spreading oaks, as their ancestors had
done, to give way to merriment. He
thar.ked his auditors for the Interest they
showed by their presence In the celebra
tion given under the auspices of the An
cient Order of Hibernians. Father Crow
ley then introduced Charle6 D. South, the
poet of the dav, who read the Independ
ence day ode. It was listened to with deep
Interest. The first and last stanzas of the
poem follow:
Out of the dlmnesÂ» of ares the ehade* of thÂ«
fathers appear.
Out of the x>ast end Its silence their voices to
day ring clear:
"God for the children of Jacob clave them a
path through the sea.
Out of the bondage of Egypt into the sun of tnÂ«
free."
Ours be forever thÂ« U cenfi: Â¦Wherever our flaÂ«
Is unfurled,
Loudly the trumpet of Freedom proclaim! her
advance to the world'.
Ours he the faith of the fathers; ours be the
jiath thev have trod'.
God be our rock and our tower; the nation the
grlory of God!
After the reading of the poem, the ora
tion of the day was delivered by John
O'Gara. His utterances were punctuated
with frequent and merited applause.
After touching briefly on the events that
led up to the declaration of independence,
Mr. O'Gara paid a glowing tribute to the
Celtic rauce. the children of which had
contributed In no small degree to liberat
ing, forming and upbuilding the Ameri
can nation. Other races, it is true, he
said, had been important factors, but none
were more devoted In time of war or more
Influential for good In time of peace than
the sons of Erin.

all. however, the day passed off witnout a
single accident being recorded, which re
â¢ult is largely atirioutable to the extra
â¢fierce of regular and Â»-pecial otlicers on
I the grounds.
The fireworks on the lake became the
center o* attraction after the indoor show,
ar.d the 1<u>a) people who t-tood patiently
until the !a*-t rocket had whizzed up into
th<Â» fog were rewarded by the sight of
some novel set piece*, bosides red tire and
etar scattering bombs galore. The effect
of the latter, though, was spoiled by the
mist, which blew in off the ocean and ef
fectually hid the color bursts of the
rockets.
The eft pieces, however, showed to
Fnlendid advantage. On a platform at
the lower md of the lake a stand was
erected, and from a "property" marble
fountain it supported there spouted as a
rir.aio to the- oihrijay. a dozt-n jets or
glowing flame which changed from color
to color and varied their terms till the
great crcwd Fhouted with delight. Be

ot tn<- Oregon. 1j> no means stranded,
but claphins through a bombarding fleet,
firing right and left, tiil a waterfall of
red. white and blue fire shut the scene
out.
The only bitter drop in the day's pleas

turning merrymakers had to, walk to
Hayes and McAllister streets, several
blocks away across sand lots to avoid
Fitting down town too late to transfer to

EMPEROR WILLIAM
WARNS THE WORLD
i Gives Utterance to Some Very Strong
Words at the Launching of a
New Battleship.
BERLIN'. July 4.â At a banquet at Wil
helmshaven of the Officers' Club yester
day, subsequent to the launching of the
warship Wltteisbach, Kmperor William,
In response to a toast proposed by Prince
Rupprccht of Bavaria to "the head of the
German navy," made some emphatic dec
larations upon the subject of Germany as
a pea power, asserting that the navy was
indisppn.oable to Germany's greatness and
that it had been demonstrated that no
great decision could ever again be reached
in respect to the sea without consulting
with Germany and the German Emperor.
"The German people." said he. "did not
conquer and shed blood thirty years ago
in order to be thrust aside when great
foreign problems are be'.ng settled. If thnt
happens then the position of the German
Empire as a world power would be at an
f-nd. I am not inclined to allow matters to
reach such a pass. It is the Emperor's
duty and highest privilege to employ suit
| able and even the sharpest methods to
prevent it."
The German Emperor expressed it as his
conviction that in this matter the Princes
of Germany and the entire people were
closely massed behind him.

SIDNEY LUCAS
DEMONSTRATES
HIS GAMENESS
After Winning One Purse He
Starts in a Stake and Makes'-
Remarkable Showing." ;^
CHICAGO, July 4.â To-day's programme
at Washington Park had "one of the most
unique features In the history of Western
racing. It was the attempt of a colt to
win two races m.one day, and in the lat
ter event to concede weight to and beat
the best two youngsters in the West next
to himself. Richard Thompson, the own
er of Sidney 'Lucas,' the American Derby
winner, started the colt In the second
race, at one mile, and after he had won
his race sent him to the post In the Sheri
dan stakes, just an hour later. Here Sid
ney carried 129 pounds, to 125 for Sam
Phillips and 125 for Advance Guard.
It seemed preposterous to believe the
colt could go the mile and a quarter route
under such circumstances, and the book
makers made him the outsider in the bet
tine at 2 to 1, 'Advance Guard being the
'favorite at 3 to 4, with Sam Phillips, at
The race was a "loaf for over a half
mile. Sidney Lucas being allowed to set
the pace. <0n the backstretch Vlttitoe on
Advance Guard became alarmed about the
loader and sent the Canadian colt up. Sid
ney Lucas and Advance Guard raced to
cpther at tou speed around the far turn
and to the entry to the stretch. Burns
did not begin his ride until he was almost
ready to make the run for home. The re
sult was a thrilling finish, the trio pasfingr
the Judges under a terrific drive only nait
lengths apart, with Sam Phillips leading.
Advance Guard second and Sidney Lucas
third. Horsemen all agree that the three
colts finished exactly the reverse of their
merit, although they were fairly well
matched and outclass all the other three
year-olds In the West.

BACK in the files of the oM days of
the first actors is a much-quoted
proverb, "Never 'monkey' with the
property man." Henry Miller, now
at the Columbia Theater, although a stu
dent of dramatic history, did not until
Tuesday evening appreciate the subtle
wisdom of this trite aphorism. Never
again will he Ignore It. ; It took a prop
erty man to teach him a lesson in "back
of-the-lights" ethics, and henceforth the
leading man and organizer of companies
will not play with the gunpowder spirit
of a property man, especially .on the eve
of the Fourth.
Before the show Tuesday evening Miller
and Charles Blesser. property king of the
Columbia, disagreed in regard to a stage
setting. Miller said something. Then
Blesser said something. Miller came
again with words that had no sweetness
in their sound, and Blesser. not to be out
done, gave the retort acrid and a shade
or two profane. Of course the actor was
put to the test and Blesser-was, cursed.
In the heat of his temper Miller essayed
to dlscharge'the property man, assuming
an authority that was part and parcelof
the rights belonging to the managers of
the Columbia Theater, whose employe
Blesser was and still is.
After this Miller looked about for the
assistant property man, but the latter re
fused to accept his superior's job. Right
down the line of stage hands â¢went the
Â»ctor, but no one would substitute himself
.for Blesser, even for a moment.
Miller was in a quandary and the Gott
lobs were called in to relieve the situa
tion. By soft, pleading speech Miller was
brought around to due acknowledgment
of the error of his ways, and he person
ally sought Blesser with a humble apol
ogy on his lips. Blesser held th<? key to
the situation and for a moment the star
was forced to act up to the property man.
The scene was of the pathetic kind that
usually comes as the firth act of a melo
drama, when all are happy and satisfied.
But B!esser Is net the only property
man in town. On the Tivoll stage there
Is another, whose name Is Tony Kenna.
Tuesday evening the latter stumbled upon
Blesser, who told him his story.
"Pshaw!" said Kenna; "he's easy. Just
wait and we'll tlx this gay trifler who
shows no respect for our lofty calling."
The plot was hatched then and there.
While Miller was- working himself lntÂ«j
several varieties of ecstasies and passions
that night a counter plot of the real "gun
powder" order was brewing on the outside
of the theater.
In the fourth act of the "Tree of Knowl
edge." the most intensely interesting of
the play, when the audience is pop-ey.xl
and scratching its toes in anticipatory ex
citement, the bomb burst. Miller com
plains to &Ii?3 Anglin that his sleep is
not In a healthy condition. He has worn
himself out and that "balm to hurt
minds" refuses to visit hla unpent lids.
Miss Anglin suggests "dope." Miller like-*
the idea, for he is supposed to have us<?d
it many a time and oft during the preced
ing acts. He swallows some stage mor
phine and away he goes Into the land of
"death's beautiful brother." Miss Anglin
moves to the piano. Her dlrgeful minors
are supposed to be a signal for Mr.
Worthing," her lover, to appear and carry
her away from the "doped." The scene
Is one of tens?, nervous waiting with a
strain that wouM snap whip cords.
Suddenly there was an explosion back
of the stage. Another followed in quick
succession. The morphine-dosed Mille* 1 ,
whose cue it was to say nothing or lo
nothing but sleep while the plot devel
oped, went up In the Â«ir like a balloon.
At the second shot he rolled to the floor.
All the ingenuity and collected nervÂ»,
born of experience, hardly saved th*
scene. When the curtain dropped on ths
act there was more indulgence In impre
cations.
Those two shots came from the Tlvoll
property man's shotgun placed in a chink
of the Columbia Theater wall. He knew
when the scene took place and he played
the avenger.

STARS AND STRIPES
HONORED IN FRANCE
PARIS, July 5.â Never in the history of
the American â¢ colony in Paris has the
Fourth of July been celebrated with such
enthusiasm and brilliancy as yesterday.
Certainly never before have the Govern
ment of France and the French people
associated themselves with America's fete
day. The President of the republic took
it upon himself to personify France at the
Lafayette inauguration in the morning,
while in addition the Cabinet, with
the exception fit Premier Waldeck-Rous
seau. who was engaged elsewhere, attend
ed In a body. M. Deechanel and M. Fal
lieries emphasized the action in a recent
resolution of good will to America in the
two houses of Parliament, over which
they preside, by their presence at the cer
emonies. Among the distinguished French
men present were also Jules Claretle, di
rector of the Comedle Francalse, and six
members of the Lafayette family.
The Stars and Stripes. flew everywhere
on the public buildings, along the boule
vard, on the river steamboats and on the
top of the Eiffel tower 4 where floated the
biggest American flag ever made, which
was sent over specially for; the purpose
from the Department -of. the Interior at
Washington. Every American in Paris
apparently deemed it his duty to wear a
miniature flag. The American pavilion
was especially decorated with the national
colors. -^
NATION'S BIRTHDAY AT
THE NATION'S CAPITAL
WASHINGTON, July 4.â The birthday
of the republic was celebrated in the

the Revolution, the Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution and the Oldest Inhabitants
Association abandoned their customary
exercises at the foot of the monument
of Washington and read the Declaration
of Independence in the copier recesses of
churches and woods. The absence of' the-
President from the city accentuated 'the
lack of life that marked the Government
departments. All the Government offices
were closed except the : State, War and
Xavy buildings, where a few officials
awaited whatever tidings ' might be re
ceived from China. -. ,

TO ARRIVE.
Gilbert <lu Motier, Marquis de Lafayette!
Oh that words of mine .could express the full
burning love which our revolutionary sires did
bear to this illustrious son of old Auvergne:
Oh that I could pronounce his name with the
reverence with which my countrymen across
the sea wish me to pronounce it before the
people of France. In America two names are
the idols of our national worship, the burden of
fireside tale, the inspiration of the poet's song,
the theme of the orator's discourse; the name
of him who was the Father of his Country-
George Washington; and the name of him who
was the true and trusty friend of Washing
ton. Gilbert du Motier. Marquis de Lafayette!
Wealth and rank, the favor of court and king,
high distinction in the sen-ice of his own coun
try the endearments of wife and childâ all that
ambition could coj^t or opportunity promise.
the youth of nineteen summers put resolutely
aside to cast his lot with a far-off people bat r
tling against fearful oddsâ and that at a mo
ment when their fortunes Vere at their lowest
ebb and ho;>e had well-nigh abandoned their
standards. When the agent of America in
France sadly contested that he was even un
able to furnish a ship to carry him and other
volunteers, Lafayette said: "I will buy a ship
and take your men with me."
Given a command in the army of Independ
ence Lafayette was at all times the "preux
chevalier, sans peur et Bans reprpche." The
highest traditions of French chivalry were re
vived. A Roland, a Bayard, a Dugesclln lived
again in the. camps and on the battlefields of
America. . Â» -
By his magnanimity of soul and by his grace
of manner. not less than by his military
rrowesfc, he won all hearts and became the Idol
of the American army. /Ie proved himself, to
the inmost fiber of his soul, an American, as
proud of America as the proudest of her pa
triots the champion before all . contestants of
her honor and her fair name. I More cheerfully
even than his American companions In armn, he
bore the terrible hardships of the war; again
and again he pledged his personal fortune to buy
food and clothing for his men, who knew him
by the ' familiar appellation of "the Marquis,
the soldiers' friend." In camp and in battle
his influence was boundless; a' word of cheer
from his lips roused the drooping eplrlta of his
soldiers, a word of command sent them head
long against the enemy. A visitor to the
American camp, the Marquis de Chastellux.
could not help remarking that Lafayette was
never iÂ«poken of without manifest tokens of
attachment and affection.
Ves. America's gratitude Is due and Is given
to the France of a century ago â to Louis XVI,
r>e Vergennes. De Maurepas. who ruled In those
days her destinies; to the people of France*
who cheerfully bore the burdens which our war
brought upon them; to the seamen and soldiers
of France, who offered their lives In sacrifice
upon the altars of American liberty, -â¢ and
America's gratitude Is due and is given to the
Franre of to-day, the living heir to the rights
and the glories of rulers and soldiers and peo
ple of former ages. Rulers and soldiers and
people of a Â«Â«ntury ago have passed away, but
the country 1 spy loved and represented remains;
France rema-Js. and to France the republic of
the United States of to-^Jay pledges her grati
tude and her friendship and promises that both
shall be "everlastlnr"
To America and France is given the noble
mission to be to the world thÂ«* exemplars of
civil and political liberty. That they be true
to their mission' must be the prayer of all
friends of liberty, of all friends of humanity.
The-better to-lnÂ»ure the possession of liberty
they have taken to themselves the highest form
of ' democracyâ they have made Â¦ themselves re
publlcts. They must show that. such form .of
liberty is capable of enduring amid all the
writhlncs and passions of humanity and that
beneath it in harmony with its promises there
are to be found liberty's ! beet and sweetest
blessings. To them Is assigned the task of
proving that the fullest democracy guarantees
to a people, together with liberty, the security
of law and order and the growth and prosperity
of the nation â that the fullest democracy, ever
true to Its name and profession, means for the
Individual man and citizen the actual- and as
sured enjoyment of the personal rights which he
inherits from Nature and Nature's God,, save
only Inasmuch as a retrenchment of Buch right*
Is Imperative for the maintenance of public or
der and the safeguarding of the rights of other
members of the community. 'And now what Is
said to-day be It said . to-morrow, be it said
adown the ages to come. :
Here upon this historic "Place" in France'*
Archbishop Ireland said in part
The scene within the amphitheater was
most striking and picturesque. The ris
ing tiers of seats were filled with about
2000 invited guests, a large proportion of
whom were ladles, whose handsome cos
tumes greatly contributed to the color ef
fect.
President Loubet, who was attired' in a
frock coat, with the insignia of the high
est rank of the Legion of Honor at his
buttonhole, stood bareheaded, surrounded
bv the French and American dignitaries.
General Porter then advanced to the
tribune and welcomed the guests.
The general spoke the first part of his
address in English and the rest in French.
Commissioner Peck followed.
A signal was then given and the boy3
previously referred to, dressed in white
flannel suits and sailor hats and wearing
tri-color sashes, pulled the strings releas
ing the American flag enveloping the
S As Ul? the flag dropped and the heroic
statue of Lafayette offering his sword to
the American cause was unfolded to view,
a scene of great enthusiasm occurred.
The whole assembly arose, cheered _and
waved hats, handkerchiefs and American
flags, while Sousa-s band Pl a >" c< ! Â» u e $
and especially composed march. Hail to
the Spirit of Liberty." ,
When the ringing applause subsided
President Loubet stepped to the front of
the platform and again cheers broke
forth Americans and Frenchmen uniting
in heartv shouts of "Vive, vive Loubet
vive la France." The President spoke but
briefly ulluding to the traditional friend
ship of" the two republics, the entire audi
ence remaining standing and uncovered
until the end of his remarks
President Loubet said in part.
Gentlemen: This magnificent monument con
secrate* the time-honored friendship and union
of two great nations. In generous Impulse the
Government or the United States, through the
Housedâ¢ Representative, has g Â»ven CorceXo the
ceremony which brings us before the .W?Ws
this common ancestor. But the lnlt ] \ a >1 U^ u o r L t h h e d
fete springs from the school of youth nourished
by the beautiful- examples of history and the
noblest traditions.
I am happy to associate myself with the cor
dial thanks which the Chambers have already
Bent to the people of the United States and to
renew them in the name of entire
spectacle of these two republics consecrating
this monument by the same emotions and ani
mated by the same thoughts is not less a lesson
than a fete. It shows that among nations, as
Vmong individuals, the calculations of selfish
ness are often more opposed to thelrtattrert.
than the generous movements of the heart.
\VhenU~.fayeUe crossed the ocean to heir a
people to win its Independence he was not the
plaything of. heroic folly. He Â«rrÂ« a deep
political object. He was about to cement the
friendship of two peopl-s on the common wor
ship of their liberty. This friendship, born In
the brotherhood of arms, has developed and
strengthened through the """ftj^teh ft

not let it become enfeebled. They will strive

PARIS. July 4.â In the presence of the
President of the republic, M. Loubet; the
United States Embassador, General Hor
ace M. Porter, and a brilliant assemblage
of representative Frenchmen and the
most prominent members of the Ameri
can colony hore, the statue in honor of
General the Marquis de Lafayette, the
gift of the American school children to
France, was presented to the nation by
Ferdinand W. Peck, president of the La
fayette Memorial Commission, and was
accepted by President Loubet In behalf
of France. This latter fact constitutes
Eloquent testimony of the importance the
French Government attached to the occa
sion and its desire to enhance Its signifi
cance by having the President assume the
leading role in the exercises, for which
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Del
.casse, was originally designated.
The ceremonies occurred in the garden
of the Tuilleries.* The monument was un
veiled by two boys, representing the
schools of France and America, Gustav
Hennocque. great-grandson of â¢ the Mar
quis de Lafayette, and Paul Thompson,
son of the projector of the monument.
After a few words by Paul Thompson
and the reading of the dedicatory poem
by Miss Voss, representing the Daugh
ters of the Revolution, Archbishop Ire
land delivered an address, and Mrs. Dan
iel Manning spoke on Lafayette and the
Daughters of the American Revolution.
Embassador Porter was president of the
day's exercises.
Address of Acceptance Is Made by
President Loubet and an Oration
Is Delivered by Arch
bishop Ireland.
Gift of the American School
Children to the French
Nation.
UNVEILING OF
THE STATUE OF
DE LAFAYETTE
And now, Lafayette, thy task is given thee.
Speak, we charge thee, the. .gratitude of Amer
ica to France; speak of the liberty for which
America and France once fought together and
which to-day they together cherish and uphold.'
Speak, we charge thee. through endless years:
through endleps years America's gratitude
shall last and liberty shall reign In America
and France.
own capital city, where meet the nations of the
earth, there will stand, with France's gracious
permission, an abiding interpreter of America's
gratitude to France for Her participation In
America's war, and of the principles of civil
and political liberty which were the life and
soul of that momentous struggle. Our Inter
preter, who shall It be? Who could it be. if
truth has rights, and merit has reward, but
Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette? Then
genius of art, we pray thee give us back the
form of our loved Lafayette. Bid him live
again in his otvn France to speak In America's
name to France and to the woHd. Who more
fittingly than Lafayette could be bidden ' to
speak to France the gratitude of America?
And who more fittingly than Lafayette could
stand forth before the world as the represen
tative of the principles of civil and political
liberty for which he and Washington fought?
The enemies of liberty he hated â absolutism in
Its arbitrary authority and anarchy In its
chaotic rioting. When the struggle in France
for liberty degenerated Into mad riot he cast
aside the leadership which he had taken in the
name of liberty, and which he could have' re
talned if he bore it in the name of lawlessness]
and he sought the. exile which ended for him
in thÂ» prison of Olmutz. Absolutism and an
archy alike hate Lafayette as they alike hate
liberty: the friends of liberty love Lafayette as
they hate absolutism and anarchy.

completed his foul work, Moody placed
the muzzle of the revolver in his own
mouth and fired. His attempt to end his
own existence failed. The bullet nearly
severed his tongue and round egress in
the back part of his neck. Detective
O'Dea, who was in the vicinity, and a
number of bystanders rushed to the scene
and the stricken woman was taken to O.
A. Leifler*s drug store at 38 Third street,
where she was given temporary treatment
by Dr. Nathan Rogers.
Moody was promptly placed under ar
rest and surrounded by curious people
who listened to his howls of agony while
waiting for the patrol wagron. The jockey
was rushed to the Receiving Hospital and
might have bled to death en route but
for Dr. Morris Harvey, who accompanied
him. Drs. Bunnell and Bacigalupl stayed
the flow of blood and took four stitches in
ihe severed tongue and he was then
placed In bed. He was so violent that it
was found necessary to strap his arms
and legs to the cot.
A few minutes later Mrs. Roylance was
brought to the hospital in an ambulance.
She was accompanied by her husband.
The unfortunate woman was laid upon
the operating table, and while the. sur
geons Â¦were dressing her wounds, moaned
and begged them not to let her die. One
of the bullets fired by Moody was found
flattened against her corset. This same
bullet cut through two of the lingers of
the right hand. Another bullet entered
the left chest and is probably imbedded
in the spine. The doctors were unable to
find It, but gave it as their opinion that
this was so, as the woman complained
that she nad no feeling in her limbs and
they were growing: cold.
Identifies Her Assailant.
As the woman's condition was critical,
Detective O'Dea and Ofttcer O'Callahan
brought Moody into the operating room
to be identilied by her.. As ho entered,
barely able to walk, and assisted by the
officers, Mrs. Roylance gazed at his
blood-stained and distorted face and with
out hesitation declared he was the man
who tried to kill her.
. When Roylance saw the man who shot
his wife he became frantic and looked
about him for a weapon. Finding none
he attempted to spring past the physi
cians and fall -upon Moody, but powerful
hands restrained him. The husband then
bemoaned his fate in not having a pistol
with him. - -
Moody did not shrink from the infur
iated man, but tried to go closer to the
woman, attempting to kiss her and call
ing her endearing names. He waa led
away, crying and howling from pain and
love of the woman whose -life he attempt-
As Mrs. Roylance's condition grlves but
slight hope of her recovery representa
tives of the District Attorney's olflce went
to her t bedside and took her dying state
ment. *The husband had to -be forcibly
removed from the ; room by Detective
Ryan, because he persisted in telling his
wife not to, answer the questions put to
her. During the enforced absence of. the
husband, the following statement was
made by the dying woman:'
â¢ Woman's Ante-Mortem Statement.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 4, 1900.
I. Lulu Roylance, knowing that I am about
to die. that I am going to die and that I
cannot live, and with full knowledge of my im
pending death, do hereby make this my dying
statement and speak the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help me God;
and Btate as follows:
On tt-e Fourth of July, while waiting at the
entrance of the Winchester . Hotel on Third
street, I was talking to my friend, Harold
Adams, waiting for my husband, Leon. While
I was standing talking to him. Al Moody came
up to me and I could not tell whether he said
anything to me or not; all I know is that he
fired b. pistol oft; I saw the silver shlninir. I
hollered for help, and I felt my body warm.
1 think he, Al Moody, ghot me four times. He
looked me right In the face and shot me four
times without a word.
He. Al Moody. Raid if I ever lived with my
husband again .he would kill me. If I ever
went back to him. , LULU ROYLANCE.

Jealousy the Cause.
Moody will recover and will answer for
his crime. He has been residing with T.
T. Collins at 1224 Folsom street, and is
employed by the Code- Port wood Canning
Company. He claims to have come re
cently from Ban Jose, and a Jockey's li
cense found on him by Detective Charles
Coady. which was issued by the American
Turf CongTess, dated March 10, 1900, bears
out his statement, as it gives his residence
as San Jose. At one time Moody occupied
rooms at the boarding-house where Mrs.
Roylance lived, and while there became
infatuated with the woman.
Â«.jxs. Roylance and her husband, who Is
a consulting and constructing engineer,
with rooms in the Parrott building, had a
disagreement and had been living .apart
for come time. The husband occupied
rooms at the Winchester House and Mrs.
Roylance went to live with her mother
at 423 Eddy street. On Tuesday evening
the couple effected a reconciliation and
the wife went to the apartments Of the
husband. They Â¦were on their way to view
tne parade yesterday morning, when Roy
lance remembered that he had to tele
phone to a friend. He stepped inside the
hotel to telephone and his wife waited for
him on the sidewalk. She was Joined by
Adams and then Moody came along and
started to shoot. ->
Roylance speaks in endearing terms of
his wife and their golden-haired boy. He
said that Moody was crazy and had in
flicted his attentions upon his wife. He
said his wife hated him.
The following epistle, signed "Maud,"
which the. police claim is the assumed
name of Mrs. Koylance, throws some light
on the affair:
CITY. July, 1900.
Dear Alâ If nothing new turns up In the
meantime, I will spend the Fourth with you.
Come here for me about 11 or 11:30 o'clock a.
m., as not knowing where you are going do not
know what to wear. If anything happens that
I cannot go, I* is at the house. I will tele-,
phone to Jack at 10:30 a. m. on Wednesday
morning, the Fourth. You make arrangements
with him ho he will deliver my messase to
you immediately and if you can not come

take a notion to come here when I least ex

turns up. I hope this will find you more cheer

out. so must close and send this. Yours with

Loving Epistles From Maud.
The following additional letters were
found in the pockets of Moody and are
now . in the possession of Captain Sey
mour:

My Dear Boy: I was pleased and surprised
to receive the letter from Ban Jose to-day. Such
a loving, kind letter, too. I shall always. keep
It safely put away. You. always spoke as if
you wrote dreadful. Why, you story-teller, you
write lovely. I am- quite proud of -my baby's
letter. It seems an age since I saw you; but,
dear, it is for 'the best, as I never know -when
L. may come here. Fir. night I was taking a
bath at 10 o'clock when he came. I could not
go to the door, so he came the back way. I
went to dinner with him Sunday. Â¦ Promised
me a new. dress on the lath. It Is policy for
me. to be friendly with him. He is as anxious
as I am for the separation, and Just as soon as
we have the cash I will be free. Â¦ Without
money you cannot do as you wish. - If any time
he roes out of the city and I can find a way
to see you I will drop you word or telephone.
I will write, and let you know how things pro
ceed, and If you get time I will be pleased . to
hear from you. We can think of each other.
They cannot stop that. Friday evening I saw
you go Into the "Olympia." We went, too. I
looked all aver the place for you, but failed to
see you. - That place Â¦ is getting worse . and
worse. A man followed ' me home, .was' up
three steps after me, when I simply shut the
door In his face. I am real good. I hope you
are well and happy, and tell Jack to be 'good
to you. Bay. that Sullivan girl is a peach. 1 1
was wondering if you saw her. that night.
Have a good time with her if you can, because
1Â£ you don't have some lady you will get mel
ancholy, and she Is pretty and nice. Harold
leaves to-night. Well, - dear, I have not any
rtews to relate, only my teeth are fllled, but'
one is aching dreadfully, and I suppose it will
have to come out. Take good care of yourself
and write me a line. I will destroy letters and
you do the same. I will keep Just the Hrst

kisses from babe.' Your as ever, MAUD.

from a gasoline engine on a combined
harvester. The harvester was destroyed.

trip. The tracks of his wagon were traced
to First avenue and Market street, where
the murder was undoubtedly committed.
Two distinct reports were heard by people
living in the neighborhood. The wagon
containing the body was found a block
away, but nearer Imsand's home.
Sheriff Mansfield, on being notified of the
crime, proceeded to the home of the Mit
chells. He arrested Dave and William Jr.,
but the father was not arrested until the
following evening. Mitchell's house was
searched and disclosed the presence of a
pistol, shotgun and rifie.
The Mitchells and Imsands had been at
war for some time. A dispute over prop
erty had been carried into court and ihe
Imsands won. The Mitchells vowed venge
ance, vowing to drive the other family out
of the county.
Mrs. Elizabeth Mitchell and Her Son David Shot
Down in a Mysterious Mannerâ Suspicion Falls
on the Husband of the Woman.
COLMA has added two more murders,
to it8 record and, like the killing a'
year ago, they are shrouded in
mystery. Mrs. Elizabeth Mitchell
and her son David were found dead on
their hog ranch late last evening
by Constable David Neville. Both
had met their death from gunshot
wounds, and tha position of their bodies
indicated that they had fallen in their
tracks. Suspicion has fallen upon the
husband of the dead woman, and the po
lice, of San Mateo and of this city are
looking for him.
But for the notification given Constable
Neville by John Roper and Thomas O'Mal
ley of Colma, the bodies would not have
been discovered until to-day because the
Mitchell ranch is a mile from. Colma and
a half mile off the county road. Accord
ing: to the Constable, O'Malley and Roper
were driving along the. county road,. when
they were accosted by William Mitchell,
who was trudging along the path on Ilia
way to the city. Mitchell volunteered the
information that there had been a shoot
ing at his place and asked that they noti
fy the Constable and Sheriff of that fact.
In accordance with this request Consta
ble Neville .was notified and in company
with an assistant visited the hog ranch
and found the bodies lying cold in death
on the ground some distance from the
house, tiaping wounds in the heads and
bodies showed clearly that foul work had
been/done. The officers made a thorough
search of the house, but there was noth
ing to indicate that a scuffle had taken
place. Both bodies were then removed
to the. dwelling place and word was im
mediately sent to Sheriff Mansfield of San
Mateo County of the murder.
A description of Mitchell, upon whom
suspicion has fallen, was telephoned to
this city "and officers were sent to his
haunts in the hope of capturing him. Up
to a late hour he had not been taken Into
custody; Mitchell had been living with
the murdered woman many years. They
conducted a hog ranch and were assisted
by the son David. Another son, William
Mitchell Jr., lives in South San Francisco.
The woman was white, the son a mulatto
and the husband a negro. The husband
was disliked by his neighbors and a feud
was on between them. When Joseph j.
Imsand was shot and killed a year ago
suspicion fell upon Mitchell, who had left
Colma after the murder had been com
mitted. He was captured while leaving
the Alcazar building, where he had been
attending a meeting of his lodge, but the
charge against him was dismissed as it
could not be proved.
The murder of Mrs. Mitchell and her son
recalls the deadly affair that occurred be
tween the Imsand and Mitchell families
last August, when the body of Joseph J.
Imsand, filled with buckshot, was found
within a few hundred feet of where the
shooting of yesterday occurred.
Imsand was a hog rancher, and had as
neighbors the Mitchells. Both families
disputed continually over the boundary
line between their properties. A battle en
sued between them, in which William
Mitchell Jr. received severe wounds. A
few weeks later the members of the Im
sand family were : poisoned by drinking
water from the creek which flows through
the ranches of both families. The poison
ing of the cteek was laid at the door of
the Mitchells; and added to the feeling of
enmity then* existing.
A few days r.fter Imsand left his home
at 3:30 a. rav on his regular swill-gathering
DOUBLE MURDER AT COLMA
RECALLS A TERRIBLE FEUD
MRS. L. ST. D.ROYLANCE FALLS VICTIM
TO ALFRED MOODY'S JEALOUS RAGE
In the Moving Throng on Third Street the Ex- Jockey Fatally Shoots
the Woman He Professes to Love, Tries to Kill â¢"Her Com
panion, and Then Attempts to Commit Suicide.

PRINCIPALS IN THE DOUBLE IHTRDEH AT COUffA. .
FREXZIED with drink and Jealousy,
Alfred Moody, an ex-Jockey, at
tempted to commit a double murder
and suicide on Third street at 10
o'clock yesterday morning. That he was
not entirely successful was due to Provi
dence and not to bad marksmanship. As
a. result of his murderous acts Mrs. St. l).
Roylance of 423 Eddy street is hovering
between life and death at the City Re
ceiving HoppStal, with but a slight chance
of recovery. Moody, severely, but not
fatally wounded by a bullet from his own
revolver, lies on a cot in an adjoining
room weeping and moaning. The other In
tended victim of the murderous Jockey
escaped unscathed. The shooting:- oc
cjrrwi while the street was crowded_with
men, women and children wending their
way to Market street to view the big
Fourth of July parade, and the miracle is
that none of them Â¦was struck by the fly-
Ing bullets.
Mrs. Roylance was standing in front of
the Winchester Hotel, at the corner of
Third and Stevenson streets, waiting for
her husband, who was telephoning. "While
standing there H. S. Adams, a clerk in
Fisher Brothers' furnishing house, 15S
Third street, and who resides at 313V6 Ellis
etreet, stopped in passing to speak to her
%vhrn Moody, bent on murder, came up
and without a moment's hesitation pulled
a. 35 caliber revolver from his pocket and
opened flre on the woman. She screamed,,
and as Adams turned to see who fired the
shot Moody aimed at him. Adams did not
wait to see the gun go off. but sprang
toward the curbing. The accuracy of the
Jockey's aim was attested by the fact that
the bullet grazed Adams' right shoulder.
Shoots His Pollen Victim.
The would-be" murderer then turned his
attention again to the woman, who had
fallen fainting to the sidewalk, and before
the amazed and terror-stricken bystand
ers could interfere he fired twic& more at
his victim. Then, believing that he had
