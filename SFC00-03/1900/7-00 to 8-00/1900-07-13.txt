THAT EDICT OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT
his acts . aro authenticated \ by seal, ; which
WASHINGTON, July 12.â The good im
pression made by the edict of. the Chinese
Government given out by Minister Wu
yesterday threatens to be offset to some
extent to-day by the reports from London
stating that Prince Tuan was the real
author of this edict and that some of Its
most forcible anti-foreign language was
omitted from the version given out here.
But at the Chinese legation these intima-^
tlons from London are dismissed, as
groundless. The dispatch was received
here in Chinese; that is, in the numerals
by which the Chinese Government trans
mits itsofttclal code. messages. .This in lt
self, it is said, indicates that it came with
the sanction of those; In imperial author
ity, as the official' code 13 not known out
side of this limited circle.
Two translations were requiredâ first
from the numerals to the Chinese, and
second from tho Chinese to the English.
These,, translations .were . rriade-by the
members of the legation staff here, so that
the ultimate text as made public con
tained the phraseology, adopted by the of
ficials in this city. 'In making their trans
lation they say thev adhered ; literally to
the telegraphed edict; so that the pub
lished text contains everything embraced
In the; original. \
When the Emperor, Kwangr Hsu. Issues
an edict he does not Jslgn> his. name, but
in. this case could not be cabled so that
the document was authenticated as com
ing from the Privy Council, the highest
body of dignitaries in China and the one
most closely associated with the imperial
household. Following an invariable cus
tom in times of disorder, the War Office
at Peking was Intrusted with furnishing
the runners to carry the message to the
Imperial Treasurer of Chili, who in turn
got it to Shanghai. From that point it
was sent direct to the various Ministers
the world over, coming to Washington di
rect instead of by the usual route of Lon
don. Under the foregoing circumstances
the Chinese officials regard it as estab
lished beyond the slightest question 'that
the edict is a bona tide expression from
the Imperial Government of China, and
moreover that It Is complete as given out
here, without the anti-foreign addenda
sought to be put into it In other quarters.
COMMUNICATION BLOCKED.
NEW YORK, July 12.â The Commercial
Cable Company sends out the following
notice: .
."We are Informed that the Great North
ern Telegraph Company has received no
tification from Shanghai that telegraphic
communication with Chefu has been in

Baron von Ketteler has received a^ tele

PLANS FOR FEEDING
THE ARMY IN CHINA
WASHINGTON, July 32.â The plans of
the War Department for feeding the army
in China are being gradually formulated.
It.l:as b**en decided that all troops des
tined for Nagasaki with a probability of
service in China shall carry sixty days'
rations, which will be. landed with them.
Transportation for this amount of stores
will be furnished at once, so that the
American contingent will be able to make
a prominent movement forward, should
it become necessary to act in semi-in
dependence with the allied forces.
A great deal of impatience Is expressed
In the department at the slow movement
of the allies, and personal friends of Gen
eral Chaffee feel confident that if he Is
given a free hand from Washington he
will Inaugurate a decided move immedi
ately on his arrival in the event that this
has not been anticipated by Colonel LIs
cum, although the latter is handicapped
by a. very n.eager force.
Manila will bu utilized as a base for all
supplies and the Commissary Department
has enough material there to meet all de
mands in the Chinese contingent. A
transport will be put In service for a regu
lar weekly run with supplies between Ma
nila and Taku, seven days dls*ant. which
will form the base on Chinese soil.
GENERAL GRANT MAY
BE SENT TO CHINA
Special Dlsnatch to The Call. /
WASHINGTON, July 12.â Brigadier
General Fred D. Grant will probably be
assigned to duty in China. It Is under
stood on excellent authority that Genera
Grant's name Is being considered by th-
Secretary of War with a view to the issu
ance of orders to him to report to Briga
dier General cnaffee for such duty at I
that officer may give him. General Chaf '
fee is senior to Grant, so that there is m
danger of any question of precedence oc
currlng.
Army officers who were spoken to to
day relative to the prospect of Genera
Grant's assignment to the Far East ap
proved the selection, not alone becaus.
of General Grant's soldierly qualities, bu
because of the Innuence his name la ex
pected to have upon the Chinese. The at
tentlon of the Secretary of War has beei
Invited to the fact that General Grant'i
father was held in high esteem by th.
Chinese, and it 13 hoped that his son com
insr in the name of the same Government
that the father served so well and faith â¢
fully Â¦will have a ' strong Influence upoi
the Celestials.
Though the officials do not know tin
fate of the American legation and othei
Americans In Peking. It Is a. fact that li
no other point In China, so far as the;
have been advised, has a citizen of thli
country been injured. This fact is a mat
ter of considerable congratulation, ant
It Is hoped that It augurs well for ttu
Americans In Peking.
TTJAN REPORTED INSANE.
CHEFTJ, July 9.â It 13 reported on goot
authority that Prince Tuaa has hecomi
insane. In consequence of the movementi
of the rebels toward Tslntau the Germaru
have withdrawn some of their troops fron
Taku to protect Tsintau.
The women and children from Ne-w
chwan? have arrived her*.
SUBSEQUENT SILENCE
DECIDEDLY SINISTER
PARIS. July 12.â The Temps this even
ing announces that It is in a position to
afilrm that, contrary to statements from
various sources, no European telegram
hns been received from Peking since that
of Sir Robert Hart, Inspector General of
Chinese Customs, dispatched Sunday,
June 24, declaring the situation was des
perato.
Continuing, the Temps says: "The sub
sequent silence is sinister. If It is true
the legations are safe they could commu
nicate with Europe. If they cannot it is
because the Chinese have juggled dates
and the massacres took place as an
nounced on June 30 or July 1."
THYING TO MTJPJDER KANG.
LONDON. July 13.-The Singapore cor
respondent of tho Express says: Two
Japanese recently made a determined at
tempt to murder Kang Yu Wei. the exiled
leader of the Chinese Reform party, who
Is here under British protection, and who
la always accompanied by four Sikh
guards. These foiled the attempt and ar
rested the assailants, but Kang Yu Wei
was badly wounded. There have been
many attempts to murder Kang Yu Wef
by poison in order to gain the price set
upon his head by tho Chinese.
WILLIAM'S POLICY UPHELD.
BERLIN, July 12.â The Bundesrath For
eign Committee, which sat yesterday and
approved Emperor William's China meas
ure, is a body specially created at the
Instance of Bavaria in order to give the
ncn-Prufsian states of Germany a chance
to control Emperor William's foreign pol
icy. Such sessions have occurred very
rarely since 1871, but his Majesty desired
to thus demonstrate that he had nothing
to hide. The committeo consists of rep
resentatives of all the non-Prussian states
of Germany. -

On the cast they shelled the French and

that are out of range of all the allied
forces, except three tv/elve-pounders from
the British cruiser Terrible. One four

ARTILLERY FIGHTING
BEGAN ON THE FOURTH
WASHINGTON, July 12.â "On to Peking" is the policy adopted by our
Government. It is said that- regardless of the Issues raised as to the
authenticity of the last Chinese note, or to the accuracy of its state
ment of fact, or question raised as to the responsibility forjthe present
situation, our Government at least is determined not to relalc its efforts
to reach Peking, to get in touch with Mr. Conger if he is alive, to take the neces
sary steps for the protection of American Interests, and, in fact, to do all those
things set out in Secretary Hay's note to the powers, including, a reckoning with
the person or persons responsible for the outrageous events of the past six weeks.
Twenty-four hours' consideration of the Chinese note leaves the officials here
convinced that it marks the beginning of a general effort on the part of the Chi
nese officials to relieve themselves ' from/responsibility for the treatment of the
foreign Ministers and the fighting at Tientsin. That, in itself, is regarded as a
hopeful sign of the approaching collapse of the Boxer movement and the termi
nation of the state of insurrection that exists in Peking and Shantung.
Victors do not apologize; hence the exculpatory statement yesterday is be
lieved to<be pregnant with meaning. â¢ '.
The news from Tientsin of the unsatisfactory relations between the allied
forces goes to confirm the AVar Department officials here In their original convic
tion that two or three brigades of American troops,.. veterans of the Indian wars,
of the' Cuban campaign and of the Philippine jungle hunt, could have achieved
some valuable results by this time had they been at Tientsin.
.It Is inferred at the War Department that Colonel. Llscutn and the two bat-,
talions of the Ninth Infantry, which arrived at Taku on Friday, have reache.l
Tientsin. Colonel LIscum was given a free hand . in the- matter of an advance,
and it is thought that by prompt movement he has already reached the beleagured
city of Tientsin, where, according to advices to-day to the British Admirality, -
reinforcements were urgently needed.. J
' ' The quartermaster's department has chartered the steamer Aztec at San
Francisco and has directed that she be fitted f or â¢ use in the transportation of
horses and mules for the Philippines or China, as the case may be.
In view of the prospective military operations in China the quartermaster's
department is favorably considering the advisability of establishing a regular
service between Taku and Nagasaki, and using the transport Logan and the
freight ships Flintshire and Wyefleld for that purpose. The Logan carried the
Ninth Infantry from Manila to Taku, and is now at the latter port. The Flint
shire and Wyefield are scheduled to leave Manila to-morrow with two battalions
of the Fourteenth Infantry and a battery", of .the. Fifth Artillery for Taku. The
selection of Nagasaki as one of the terminals Is due to the fact that all trans
ports now leaving San Francisco for Manila will touch at that port, and In case
it la desired to send the troops carried by them to China the service could be done
by the line from Taku;'without the necessity of diverting, the regular Pacific
transports from their proper destination at Manila. This arrangement would re
sult in a saving of time, as the transfer of troops could be effected more quickly
than the outgoing transport could be coaled and provisioned~for the extra trip to
China. The State Department le now in negotiation with the Japanese govern
ment for permission to land these armed forces at Nagasaki. It is expected that
this permission will be speedily granted.
"ON TO PEKING"
NOW THE POLICY
United States Realizes That
Most Active Steps Must Be
Taken at Once to Rescue
Americans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 12.â
China is playing for time in the hope of delaying action by the powers until
Lthey have become engaged in conflict among themselves. This seems to ba
tho consensus of opinion among diplomats and officials here to-day. It is
perhaps the discussion of international affairs following upon the publication
of the Chinese decree presented to Secretary Hay yesterday by Minister
Wu that is responsible for the alarming rumors that have been current here to
day that Russia and Japan are nearer war at present than they have ever been.
I have taktn pains to inquire in both diplomatic and official quarters as to
whether any new developments had occurred from which these rumors could have
sprung. I am assured," however, that no nÂ»w controversies, have arisen betweeen
the two countries, though Japan did not like the attitude adopted by Russia with
respect to the dispatch of Japanese troops to China, nor was Russia pleased with
the large number Japan proposed to throw into the Celestial empire.
The relations between Russia and Japan have been strained since Russia was
instrumental in preventing Japan from obtainirg Chinese territory as the iesult of
the Japan-Chinese war. and in subsequently taking measures for the acquisition
of territory herself. While in administration circles there is a disposition to be
lieve that Ruf-sia will withdraw from Manchuria, when the Chinese question has
been" settled, in diplomatic circles antagonistic to Russia the belief prevails that
Russia will permanently hold Northern China on the ground that her troops there
are necessary to maintain peace and order.
Another phase of the International situation whfch is causing concern is a lack
of co-operation among the foreign commanders. Th!s possibility had been antici
pated by officials of the administration, who have been anxious that something
should be done by the several Governments to fix who should command the allied
force3 and tho several divisions and brigades.
Japan proposes to send a field marshal to China. France a lieutenant general,
and others ofllcer3 of rank equal to that of France. Japan is the only country that
will send an officer of the rank of field marshal, so unless there should be some
agreement among the powers his position will be a rather difficult one to deter
mine. . v
As Japan is" sending the largest force she necessarily desires that her officer
shall command. It is further pointed out to-day that Great Britain and Russia
have vice admirals at Taku, and France will send a vice admiral to that point.
The report that the foreign troops at Tientsin do not co-operate is accepted here
as authentic, and it is likely that Secretary Hay will make every effort to induce
the powers to come to some understanding relative to the organization of the al
lied troops operating in China.

CHINA PLAYNG
GAME FOR TIME
From Le Journal Illustre.
INTERNATIONAL FORCES SEIZING A TRAIN AT TIENTSIN FOR THE ADVANCE TO PEKING, JUNE 11.
LONDON. July 13.â The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail says the following story regarding the position in
Peking emanates from Chinese official sources:
"The two remaining legations, the British' and Russian, were attacked ir force on tho evening of July 6, Prince
Tuan being in command. The attackers were divided. Prince Tuan commanded the center, the right wing was led by
Prince Tsai Yin and the left by Princy? Yin Lin. The reserves were tinder Prince Tsin Yu.
"The attack commenced with artillery fiehtina:, which was severe and lasted until 7 o'clock in the morning:, by
Â¦which time both legations were destroyed and all the foreigners were dead, while the streets around the legations were:
full of the dead bodies of both foreigners and Chinese.
"Upon hearing of the attack Prince Chir.g and General Wang Wen Sha went with troops to the assistance of the
foreigners, but they were outnumbered and defeated. Both Prince Ching and General Wang Wen Sha were killed. Sev
eral foreigners are said to have escaped through the grates, one with a heavy sword wound in his head. -
"Prince Tuan, in celebration of the ..victory, distributed 1W.000 taels art*- huge quantities of Flee to the fcpxers."
SHANGHAI. July 12.â iris report e<T{Kat a Chtnrse mere-aunt here has received a letter, from Peking, <li?tcd June SO,
Faying the legations were demolished and that the foreigners had been killed. It is announced from a good source that
SBJDOO Russians are marching on Peking from the north.
LONDON', July 13. -1:10 a. m.â A terrible veil of silence enshrouds Peking:, and there is nobody but believes the worst has
happened. It is taken for granted that all the powers have exhausted every means to get direct news from their
legations, and th* fact that their efforts have keen In vain leaves but one interpretation. The Chinese representative
in Berlin denies the statement that Li Hur.g Chang had sf-nt to him a hopeful telegram. He says that, on the con
trary, no direct telegram has boon received by him from LI Huns Chang for sonic time.
The day"s Dews is again restricted to the usual crop of untrustworthy Shanghai rumors, the most serious of which, re
ported by the correspondent of the Express, is to the effect that Europeans are directing the Chinese military operations.
The correspondent asserts th.it Captain Bailey of II. .11. S. Aurora distinctly saw a man in European garb directing the Chi
nese artilkry operations outside of Tien '.sin. * '
Foreign refugees from Tientsin openly accuse a European official, whose name the Express correspondent suppresses.

Taotai of Shanghai protested to the powers against these Russian slaughters.
It is ?s?erted that the Buddhist prints throughout the empire are propagating Prince Tuan's anti-foreign sentiment.
News is circulating throughout the Yangtse Valley that General Ma has inflicted a crushing defeat upon the allies at
Tientsin, and that the foreign army has been cut to pieces east of Peking. The actual impotence of the allied forces gives
color to these stories, with the worst results.
The Shanghai corrc ppondent of the Express prves Tientsin advices to July 8. when the superior range of the Japan
ese artillery enabled them to relieve the Russians, who were hard pressed at the railway station.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.the Canton escort marched toward the
President's house. By the time they had
arrived a large crowd had collected, and
the committee was received with cheers.
Senator Lodge and Senator Hanna were
in the lead of thfe notification party. Both
entered tho. house and had, a chat with
President McKinley and then returned to
the porch. A few moments later the Pres
ident, with Mrs. McKinley on his arm,
came upon the porch, and their appear
ance was heralded with general cheering.
A number of distinguished men occupied
scats on the porch, among them being
Senator Hanna, Postmaster General
Smith, Cornelius N. Bli3s, /Henry C.
Payne, Judge Day, R. C. Kerens and Rep
resentative Taylor. With Mrs. McKinley
Â¦were Mrs. Barber,, Mrs. Mary Saxton,
Mrs. Judge Day and Mrs. Charles Dawes.
Senator Lodge Speaks.
Senator Lodge immediately mounted a
small standing block and delivered his
speech, saying:
Mr. President: This committee, represent
ing every State in the Union and the organ
ized Territories of the United States, was duly
appointed to announce to you, formally, your
nomination by the Republican National Con
vention which met In Philadelphia on June 19
last, as the candidate of the Republican party
for President of the United States for the
term beginning March 4, 1S01. To be sealed
by the Republican party as their candidate
for this great office is always one of the
highest honors which can be. given to any
man. This nomination, however, comes to you.
Fir, under circumstances which give it a high
er significance and make it an even deeper
expression of honor and tru^t than usual. You
were nominated unanimously at Philadelphia.
You received the unforced vote of every dele
gate, from every State and every Territory.
Harmony of Sentiment.
The harmony of sentiment which appears on
the face of the record was but the reflection
of the deeper harmony which existed in- the
hearts and minds of the delegates. Without
faction, without dissent, with profound . sat
isfaction and eager, enthusiasm, you were nom
inated for the Presidency by the united voice
of the representatives of our great party, in
which there Is neither 'Sign of division nor
shadow of turning. Huch unanimity, always
remarkable. Is here the more Impressive be
cause it accompanies a second nomination to
the great office Which you have held for four
years. It Is not the facile triumph of hope
.over experience, but the sober approval of con
duct and character tested in many trials and
tried by heavy and extraordinary responsi
bilities. With the exception of the period In
which Washington organized the nation and
built the State, and of those other. awful years
when Lincoln led his people through the agony
of civil war and saved from destruction the
work of Washington, there has never bÂ»en a
Presidential term In our history : so crowded
with treat events, bo filled with new and mo
mentous questions as that wblch is now draw
ing to its end. True to the declarations which
were made at St. Louis in- 1806.. you, Â»slr,- united
with the Republicans in Congress In the re
\-lÂ»ion of the tariff and' the re-establishment of
the Â¦ protective policy. ,, >Â¦/-; -,'Â¦ .--,:/.- :;^ -Â¦Â¦;.- -
You maintained our credit and ' upheld the
gold standard, leading the party by your ad
vice to Uie passage cf the great measure,
which is to-day the great bulwark of both.
You led atraln in the great policy which has
made Hawaii a possession of the United States.
On all of these questions you fulfilled the hopes
and justified the confidence of the people. who
four years ago put trust in your promises. But
on all these questions, also, you had as guides,
not only your own principles, the well-con
sidered results of years of training and reflec
tion, but also the plain declarations of the na
tional convention which nominated you In 1S36.
Far different was it when the Cuban ques
tion, which we had already promised to settle,
brought first war and then Deace with Spain.
Congress declared war, but you, as commander
in-chief, had to carry it on. You did so, and
history records unbroken victory from the first
shot of the Nashville to the day when the
protocol was signed. The peace you had to
make alone. Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines;
you had to assume alone the responsibility of
taking them all from Soaln. Alone and
weighted with the terrible responsibility of the
unchecked war powers of the constitution, you
were obliged to govern th^se islands and to
repress rebellion and disorder in the Philip
pines. No party creed defined the course you
were to follow. Courage, foresight, compre
hension of American interests, both now and in
tho uncharted future, faith in the American
people and in their fitness for great tasks, were
then your only guides and counselors. .
Thus you framed and put in operation this
great new policy which has made us at once
masters of the Antilles and a great Eastern
power, holdlnc firm- our possessions on both
Bides of the Pacific.
Admirable Diplomacy.
The new and atrange ever excite fear, and
the courage and prescience which accept them
always arouse criticism and attack. Yet a
great departure and a new policy were never
more quickly Justified than those undertaken
by yop. On the possession of the Philippines
rests the admirable diplomacy which warned
all nations that American trade was not to be
shut out from China. It Is to Manila that we
owe the ability to send troops and ships in this
time of stress to the defense of our Ministers,
our missionaries, our consuls and our mer
chants in China, instead of being compelled to
leave our citizens to the casual protection of
other powers, as would have been unavoidable
had we flung the Philippines away and with
drawn from the Orient. Rost assured, sir, that
the vigorous measures which you have thus
been enabled to take, and that all further
measures in the same direction which you may
take for the protection of American lives and
property, will receive the hearty support of the
people of the United States, who are now, as
always, determined that the American citizen
shall be protected at any cost In all his rights,
everywhere, and at all times. It is to Manila
again, to our fleet in the bay and to our army
on land that we shall owe the power, when
these scenes of blood in China are closed, to
exact reparation, to enforce stern justice and
to insist on the final settlement, upon an open
door to all that vast market for our growing
commerce.
Events moving with terrible - rapidity . have
been swift witnesses to the wisdom of your ac
tion In the Easlt The Philadelphia convention
lias adopted your policy both in the Antilles
and the Philippines and has made It their own
and that of the Republican party.
Election Assures the Policy.
Tour election." sir, next November, assures to
us the continuance of that policy abroad and
in our new possessions. To entrust these diffi
cult and vital questions to other hands at once
incompetent and hostile would be disastrous
and a still more unrelieved disaster to our pos
terity.-, Your election means not only protection
to our industries, but the maintenance of
a sound currency and of the gold standard; the
very cornerstone of our economic and financial
welfare. Should these be shaken, as they would
be by the success of our opponents. Â¦: the. whole
fabric of our business confidence and prosperity
would fall Into ruin; Tour defeat would be
the signal for the advance of free trade, for the
anarchy of a debased and unstable, currency,
for business panic, depression and hard times,
and for the wreck of our foreign policy. Â¦
Tour election and the triumph of the Repub
lican party, which we believe to be as sure as
the coming of the day.. will make certain the
steady protection of our Industries, sound mon
ey, and a vigorous and Intellectual foreign pol
icy. They., will ;continue these "conditions of
good government and - wlseleglplation so essen
tial to the prosperity and well-being which have
.blessed - our country- ln~ such, abundance during
the past four, years. "
Thus announcing to you, air, your nomination
â¢j the Itepubllcaa candidate foe tie Frealdeucy,
we have the honor also to submit to you the de
claration of principles made by the National
Convention, which, we trust, will recel\e your
approval. We can assure you of tho faithful
and earnest support of the Republican party in

deepest personal gratification, this honorable
duty imposed upon us by the convention.
CheerXfor McKinley.
The Senator's, remarks were frequently
Interrupted with applause. When he
closed President McKinley mounted the
stand, the vast concourse of peopleVheer
ing heartily. It was some moments before
the President could proceed. He had a
manuscript in his hand, but he referred
to it only at long intervals. The President
spoke as follows:
Senator Lodge and Gentlemen of the Notifica
tion Committee: The message which you bring
to me is one of signal" honor. It Is also a
summons to duty. A single nomination for the
office of President by a great party which in
thirty-two years cut of forty has been trium
phant at national elections is a. distinction
which I gratefully cherish. To receive unani
mous renomlnatton by the same party is an ex
pression of regard and a pledge of continued
confidence for which it is difficult to make ade
quate acknowledemen*.
II anything exceeds the honor of the office of
President of the United States It is the respon
sibility which attaches to it. Having been in

Only one who has borne the anxieties and
burdens of the Presidential office, especially In
time of national trial, can not contemplate as
suming it a second time without profoundly
realizing the severe exactions and the solemn
obligations which it impeses, and this feeling
is accentuated by the momentous problems
which now press tor settlement. If my coun
trymen shall confirm the action of the conven
tion at our national election in November I
shall, craving divine guidance, undertake the
exalted trust to administer It for the inlahd
honor of the country and the well being of the
new peoples who have become the objects of
our care. The declaration of principles adopted
by the convention has my hearty approval. At
some future date I will consider its subjects in
| detail and will by letter communicate to your
chairman a more formal acceptance of tha
nomination.

SCENES ATTENDING THE NOTIFICATION OF THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.
In Receiving ttie Notification Committee at Canton
President McKinley Mate a Ringing Speech in
Which He Sets Forth in No Uncertain Words
the Policu of the United States,
The President seemed at his best. He
was in good voice and spirits. His ap
pearance indicated the twrt of health and
his \*olee rang out loud and clear, reach-
Ing' the outskirts of the crowd which sur
rounded the house end extended over the
lawn across the street, he speaking from
the eame place where he received the for
mal notification four years ago.
While the speech of the President closed
the formal notification, other I speakers
were called for. Senator Fairbanks of In
diana: Senator Hanna, chairman of the
National Committee; Charles E. Smith.
Postmaster Owners!; Colonel Samuel Par
ker of Hawaii and Senator Lodge were
heard. These speakers, with the excep
tion of Colcnel Â¦ Parker, who was called
out of compliment to the Pacific islands,'
took occasion to refer to the recent action
of the Democratic National Convention
The President at His Best.
When he asked "Shall we go back to
the ttriff of four years ago?" there were
shouts of "No, no," from every part of
the audience. Another prolonged cheer
greeted his words relative to the main
tenance of our authority Jn the Philip
pines. With the keenest interest- every
body followed the portion of the speech
relating to the new possessions, and there
was a mos-t impressive shout when he de
clared there fhonSd be continued legisla
tive control over the territory possessed
by the United States, and another out
burst when he said that such authority
would be coupled with "liberty and hu
manity." His declaration that the United
States had reclaimed "10.000.000 human be
ings from imperialism" made a decided
impression.
Th!s caused a gTeat deal of discuF?!on
during the conferences following the for
mal ppeech-malcine and the impression
created was that these utterances were a
notification to the world that the United
States intended to preserve all its rights
in China. The most impressive parts of
the President's speech were his reference
to the maintenance of the geld standard
nnd the financial public faith; the preser
vation of a protective tariff, the enlarge
ment of our market, and especially tho
phrase "Prosperity at home and prestige
abroad."
CANTON. Ohio. July 12.â William Mc-
Kinl- y was to-day officially notified
of his second nomination by the Re
publican party for the highest office
in tho gift of the republic. There
v.?Â« enthusiasm and to spare, and to many
of the pointed utterances of both Senator
Jx>dge and ;he President there was hearty
and cordial approval shown. Important
features of the speech of notification by
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachu^
fctts and the response by President M^^
KlnlÂ»".v were the references to the Chinese
situation.
The ' Booming" of Guns.
-' At 11:05 o'clock the, booming of. guns an
nounced the arrival of the notification
committee at the station. The members
Immediately entered carriages and with
Chairman Lodge and the members of the
notification committee, together with
Chairman Hanna and members of the Na
tional Committee, arrived on a special
train from Cleveland at 11 o'clock. They
were met at the station by a citizens'
committee in charge of arrangements,
v.-ith a band of music, and escorted, to the
home of President McKinley. Several flags
had been flung to the breeze in the early
morning and the streets through which
the procession moved had some indica
tions of a celebration. The various or
ganizations and clubs as they marched to
the President's home were grouped about
the place within seeing and hearing dis
tance of the ceremonies.
Some time before the arrival of the no
tification party President McKinley went
out into the yard and inspected and ap
proved the arrangements. The President
wore a white Kedora hat, a broad expanss
of white vest and a sack coat, of very
drmocratic appearance. He greeted the
different arrivals in a most cordial and
friendly manner. A large ' space in the
front yard was roped off and filled with
chairs for the notification party and dls
tinguirhed guests. Tables were also pro
vided for the press. Outside the roped
space numerous photographic outfits
were set up and trained on the point
where the, speaking was to take, place. :
Arrival of the Committee.
Postmaster Oeneral Smith warned his
hearers that Democratic success would
oisarrange the business interests of the
country. â .
The features of the second speech of
Senator Lodge were his resentment of
criticisms of President McKinley by his
opponents and his pointing out the dif
flcultv Mr. Bryan would have in select
ing a" cabinet from the men prominent in
the conventions at Kansas City and Sioux
The weather was perfect. The notifica
tion committee and party came from
Cleveland on a special train, making the

in Kanf=aF City. It was evident that Sena
tor Fairbanks intended to make th<;
money question the dominant issue of the
campaign, denying that with 16 to 1 in
thPir platform the Democrats could make
imperialism the leading issue.
Senator Hanna adjured Republican
voter? to remember the importance of the
This closed the speech making and trie
notification party went to luncheon in the
big tent.
After luncheon the party leaders went
Into the house. There will be a number
of informal conferences, but the time waa
devoted almost wholly to giving the vis
itors an opportunity to become personally
acquainted with the President. Whit*
there waa a considerable discussion of
politics and further policies, this was con
fined largely to the members of the Na
tional Committee. The large crowds still
lingered about the President's home and
the bands enlivened the scene from timo
Luncheon in a Bis: Tent.
Colonel Samuel Parker of Hawaii ex
plained how politics were run in the Pa
cific islands. He said he was not a
speaker but a rancher or a cowbov HÂ»*
supposed one reason Governor Roosevelt
was so popular was because he was a
cowboy. This was the first mention of
Roosevelt's name and it created applause*.
He said they had a Democratic party in
Hawaii, also an Ice trust. Thev wer;>
glad to be admitted as a State, He hnrl
some colleagues who wanted to crnns
back here when the Senators were elected.
He said he had heard a great deal about
imperialism, but when he came to Canton
yesterday he was admitted without wait
ing a minute. When he was a Cabinet
officer of the late Queen Lillunkala.nl of
Hawaii, one would have to wait a week
to see her. He was glad that kind of im
perialism was over in Hawaii.
In response to renewed calls for Hanna
the national chairman appeared and said
that tho Republican party of Ohio and the
United States expected every man to do
his duty and to do it earnestly. Hanna
caused a laugh when he said tho Republi
can party at Philadelphia had done its
duty, "McKinley kad concluded to accept
and the party must do the rest."
Mr. Hanna was followed by Charles
Emory Smith, Postmaster General, who
said that It was evident that this gather,
ing was entirely satisfied with the candi
date and the national chairman. He went
on to say that four years ago the bat
tle lines were drawn as they were to-day.
He snoke sarcastically of the Kansas City
platform, charging it with being full of
Inconsistencies. He concluded with a
high tribute to President McKinley.
Senator Lodge was recalled and paid a
Rowing tribute to President McKinley.
saying ha resented unjust criticisms of
the President during a trying time when
he was doing his full duty. He referred
to Bryan as the nominee of "mixed tick
ets" and said there was no possibility of
Bryan forming a Cabinet, and named the
leaders of the sreneral conventions as ma
terial from which selections -would have
to be made.
Senator Hanna Talks.
When the President closed there were
loud calls for Hanna, but Colonel Grant,
chairman of the local committee, intro
duced Senator Fairbanks of Indiana, who
in a brief address declared that McKinley
would be re-elected. Senator Fairbanks
pledged the vote of Indiana for McKinley.

There will be amnesty abroad and liberty,
but no abatement of our rights, no abandon
ment of our duty. There must be no scuttle
policy. We 'will fulfill in the Philippines the
obligations imposed by the triumphs of our
arms and by the treaty of peace, by interna
tional law, by the nation's sense of honor, and.
more than all, by the rights, interests and con
ditions of the Philippine people themselves.
No outside Interference blocks the way to peace
and a stable government. The obstruction
ists are here, not elsewhere. They may post
pone but they cannot defeat the realization
of the high purpose of this nation to restore
order to the islands and to establish a Just
and generous government. In which the inhabi
tants shall have the largest participation of
which they are capable. The organized forces
which have been misled into rebellion have
been dispersed by our faithful soldiers and
Bailors, and the people of the islands, deliver
ed from anarchy, pillage and oppression, recog
nize American sovereignty as the symbol and
pledge of peace. Justice, law, religious free
dom, education, the security of life and prop
erty and the welfare and prosperity of their

by unbroken judicial precedents, that the rep

U"o Abandonment of Duty.
Our platform of 18?â¬ declared "the Hawaiian
Islands phoulJ be controlled by the United
States and no foreign power should be per
mitted to Interfere with them." This purpose
has been fully accompll?hed by annexation, and
delegates from these beautiful isles, partici
pated in the convention for which you speak
to-day. In thÂ« great conference of nations at
The Hague we reaffirmed before the* world the
Monroe doctrine and our adherence to it and
our determination not to participate In the com
plications cf Europe. We have happjly ended
our European alliance in Samoa, accruing to
ourselves one of the most valuable harbors in
the Pacific Ocean, while the open door in China
gives to us fair and equal competition in the
vast, trade of the Orient. Some things have
happened which were not promised nor even
forefeen. and our purposes In relation to them
must not be left in doubt. A Just war has
been waged for humanity and with it have
come new problems and responsibilities. Spain
has been ejected from the western hetnisphera
and our flag floats over her former territory-
Cub.! has been liberated, and our guarantees to
her people will be sacredly executed. A bene
ficent government has been provided for Porto
Rico. "The Philippines are ours and American
authority must be sujvemo throughout the
archipelago.
Faithful to its pledge in these Internal af
fairs, how has the Government discharged its
international duties?
Xot satisfied with assaulting tnÂ» currency
and credit of the Government, our political ad
versaries condemn the tariff law enacted at the,
extra session of Congress in 1897. known as th9
Dingley act. passed in obedience to the will of
the people, expressed at the election in the
preceding: November, the law which at one*
stimulated our Industries, opened the idle fac
tories and mines and gave to the laborer and to
the farmer returns for their toll and invest
ment. Shall we go back to a tariff which
brings deficiency in our revenues and destruc
tion to our industrial enterprises?
Unfortunately the threat of 1S96 has Just been
rrne-wed by the allied parties without abate
ment or modification. The gold bill has been
denounced and its repeal demanded. The men
ace of 16 to 1. therefore, still hangs over us
with all its dire consequences to credit and
confidence, to business and industry. The ene
mies of sound currency are rallying: their
scattered forces. The people must once more
unite and overcome the advocates of repudia
tion and must not relax their energy until the
battje for public honor and honest money shall
azaln triumph.
A Congress which will sustain, and, If need
be, strengthen the present law, can prevent a
financial catastrophe which every lover of the
republic is interested to avert.
Threat of '96 Renewed.
assault upon It, must and will bÂ« up
held and strengthened. If sufficient revenues
are provided for the support of the Government,
there will be no necessity for borrowing money
and increasing the public debt."
Three and one-half years of legislation and
administration have been concluded since these
words were spoken. Have those to whom was
confided the direction of the Government kept
their pledges? The record is made up. The
people are not unfamiliar with what has been
accomplished. The gold standard has been rÂ«
afflrmed and strengthened. The endless chain
has been broken and the drain upon our gold
reserve no longer fetters us. The credit of thÂ«
country has been advanced to the highest place
among all nations. We are refunding our bond
ed debt bearing 3 and 4 and 5 per cent In
terest at 2 per cent, a lower rate than that of
any other country, and already more than $300,
000,000 have been so funded with a gain to
the Government of many millions of dollars.
Instead of 16 to 1, for which our opponents
contended four years ago. legislation has been
enacted which, while utilizing all forms of our
money, secures one fixed value for every dol
lar and that the best known to the civilized
world. . "
A tariff which protects American labor and
Industry and provides ample revenues has been
written In public law. We have lower Inter
est and higher wages, more money and fewer
mortgages.
The world's , markets have been opened to
American products, which go now where they
have never gone before. "We have passed from
a bond-Issuing to a bond-paying nation; from
a nation of borrowers to a. nation of lenders:
from a deficiency in revenue to a surplus; from
fear to confidence; from enforced Idleness to
profitable employment. The public faith has
been upheld; nubile order has been maintain
ed. We have prosperity at home and prestige
abroad.

Tribute to the Public and
Private Career of
the Governor.
OYSTER BAY, I,. I.. July 12â On the
breeze-swept veranda of Sagamore,
his country home. Governor Roose
velt to-dey was officially notified of
his nomination /Tor Vice President
on the Republican national ticket. The
ceremony was so simple as to be almost
informal. Surrounded by the members of
the committee on notification and a little
party of invited guests. Mrs. Roo'sevelt and
the rest of the Governor's family. Gov
ernor Roosevelt listened to the address
of notification by Senator Wolcott of Col
orado, chairman of the committee. There
was no attempt at ceremony. The party
Fimply rang-ed themselves about the wide
verandas, Â¦which command a magnificent
view of I-GnÂ£ Island Sound, and Senator
Woleott, apparently without vreliminariea
t>f any kind, delivered a short address. To
this the Governor responded briefly and
then luncheon was served. An hour was
spent in general converpation on the cool
porches and then the party returned to
Oyster Bay, where a special train was

Senator YVolcott's address was frequent
ly applauded, his reference to Governor
Roosevelt's hurting stories evoking a
hearty laugh. When he stepped, forward
he stood in a ciear space on the crowded
porvh. facing the doorway of a reception
room, in front of. which the Governor
stood in erect military attitude. To the
left were a number of ladles and other
guests, Mrs. Roosevelt and the three
Roosevelt children.
Speech of Acceptance.
When Senator "Wolcott concluded Gov
ernor Roos=evelt stepped a pace forward
and replied. Ills voice was clear and firm,
and as he proceeded there were several
Interruptions of applause. He said:
Sir. Chairman: I accent the honor conferred
upon me; with the keenest an.! detest appre
ciation of what it means, and. above alt, of
the r-e=pons!bilitr that goes with it. Every
thing that Is in my i>ower to do will be done
to Â«;-cure the re-election of President McKln
l*"y, to whom it has been given In this crisis
of the rational history to stand for and em
body the principles which ile closest to the
heart of every American worthy the name.
This Is very much m<-Te than a mere party
contest. A\> stand at the parting of the way?,
and the people have now to decide whether
they shall go forward alonjÂ» the paih of pres
|.erlty and high honor abroad, or whether they
wlll turn their backs upon what hae been
done during the past three years;- whether
they will plunge this country into an aby.->s
of misery and disaster or. what is wurt>e than
even misery and disaster, shame.
I feel that \rÂ» have a right to appeal not
ir.TWy to Rej-.ublioans, but to all boo>1 citizens',
no matter what may have been their party
affiliations in tho i>aÂ«t, and to a*k thorn, on
the ftrÂ»nfcth of the record that I'res-Ident Mc-
Kinley has made during the past three years.

fore attained in the natfon's history, and im-
C*r which abroad we have put the American

these reason* I feel we have a right to look

the verdict of the people will be next Novem
ber, ar.d to ask all men to whem the well
belnK of the country and the honor of the
national name are dear to stand with tis as
cf the flag abroad.
A round of applause broke out as the
Governor concluded, but he checked it in
stantly by saying: "Gentlemen, one me
ment. please. Here, Xed," he cried to
Senator Wuleott, *-Â»this Is not to the Na
tional Committee, but I want to sÂ« r # - this
to my friendsâ friends of my own Stateâ
who are here. Just let me pay how I ap
preciate seeing so many of you here to
day. I want to say I am more than
honored and pleased at having been made
a candidate for Vice President on the na
tional ilcket, but you cannot imagine how
badly. I feel at leaving the men with
whom I have endeavored and worked for
civic decency and righteousness and hon
esty in New York."
This little postr-rlpt to his formal speech
was heartily applauded, and the Governor
remarked:
'I nhall ask you gentlemen please to
stf p this v.ay. as some misguided photo
graphers wish to take our pictures. '
The crowd followed him to the east ve
randa, where the photographs were taken.
Refreshments were then served on the
perches and In the dining-room, and a half
hour of general conversation followed.

the special train awaited them.
On reaching the railway station the fol

Albert B. White Named for Governor

CHARLESTON. W. Va.. July 12â The
Rep-bll^an State convention adjourned
to-night after nominating the following
ticket: Governor. Albert D. Whit-*: Aud

WhitÂ© was nominated for Governor
without opposition. The contests for other
places an the State ticket were unusually
spirited and continued until the close of
the convention. There were 1045 delegates
and an unlimited number ot workers for
the different candidates.
Senator Eikins was accorded an ova
tion by the convention, over which b.9
presided as temporary chairman.
HON. M. M. F.STEE, Judge of the
United States District Court of
Hawaii has appointed as clerk of
his court Walter B. Mailing of
Portland, Me. In this award of
official patronage the great State of
Maine is recognized and a tribute Is like
wise paid to the Perkins family, as Mr.
Mailing is permitted by the rights of kin
ship to call our genial and senior Sena
tor "Uncle George."
Senator Perkins' nephew, whose quali
fications for tha clerkship were discovered
by Judge Estee before a day was desig
nated for opening the Federal court in
Hawaii, is sojourning In San Francisco.
He is employing his leisure time, prior to
the sailing of the ship for Honolulu, In
taking notes of clerical work In the court
of Hon. W. W. Morrow. United States
Circuit Judge.
Perhaps some Californians who were
looking ahead for a good time on a good
salary In Hawaii will be disappointed
when they hear of Mr. Mailing's ap
pointment, but the depression here will be
counterbalanced by the elation in Maine.
The truth should not be overlooked that
the State of Maine is an old contributor
to the greatness of California. Two Gov
ernors, for exampleâ Frederick Low and
George C. Perkinsâ hailed from Maine. It
would be churlish, therefore, to make any
faces because Hawaii Is to get something
from the Pine Tree State.
Miss Ryan, who Is connected with the
law office of Judge Estee In this city, is
booked to sail for Honolulu. She w!I! re
ceive the appointment cf secretary of the
I"ni!Â»<i States court tn Hawaii. Mr.
Reynolds, a stenographer In Judp:? Kstee'B
office here, is slated for tha position of
court stenographer In Honolulu.
Â«y=r? LLEN G. FOSTER, the new United
// \\ States Senator from the State of
Jl â v Washington, arrived from Tacoma
yesterday afternoon and is at
the Palace, temporarily, en route to Jms
Angeles. Mr. Foster is the type of man
one would expect to see In such an of
fice. He is an immense man in physique
and has a broad, handsome, honest face
that is pleasant to look upon. The Wash
ington Senator is quite well satisfied with
the political situation and has no shadow
of a doubt that McKinley and Roosevelt
will be elected.
"So far as the Northwest and. In fact,
the entire coast States, are concerned."
said he, "there is no question as to the
outcome. The Republicans will win in
good form. There is no section of tha
country that has made more progress in
the line of prosperity than this coast
in the past six months and under prevail
ing conditions we have only entered upon
the era of good times.
"Up in our end of the country every
body is making money ?nd the people are
naturaJly satisfied with the situation.
When one considers the remarkable
change that has taken place In the North
west within the past two years it is easy
to understand why there should be no de
sire for a chang-e or administration and
Bryanism.
"All this cry of anti-imperialism and
anti-everything else Is insincere and the
platform that was adopted at Kansas
City, after so much bickering, is antag
onistic to e:ood business and good govern
ment. Therefore the people of the United
States cannot afford to indorse It. I was
nomination of Roosevelt, but It was neces
sary as a return to the people of the
Quaker City to prolong the. convention
Eeveral days.
"When 1 saw these hundreds of, repre
sentative men from every section of. the
country determined upon the selection of
Roosevelt as the Vice Presidential candi
date when they knew that he was a pro
nounced expansionist 1 could not but feel
convinced that the Republican partv was
thoroughly satisfied with the policy of
President McKinley. Oregon has set the
pace at a rate that calls for admiration
and when we people of the north go to the
polls this fall we will make a showing
that Republicans can be proud of. 1 vrantÂ«
to tell the people of California that their
delegation in Congress is one of the hard
est working combinations in the capital.
In fact, there Is not a more harmonious
delegation and more good things can be
expected of them in the next session."
Senator Foster was reared on a farm In
the Western States, but is a natlva of
Massachusetts. He is a shrewd business
man and through his abilities has accu
mulated a large fortune.

The conventions -were the most remark
ible since fusion became a factor in Ne
braska politics. National politics were In
iectcd into the proceedings and at one
:me threatened a split between the Demo
crats and Populists. The question was
iver the indorsement of Stevenson for
I'iee President by the Populists, purely a
Â¦entimental one. but it provoked a storm
n that convention which practically
j'.ocked all business from 11 o clock last
night up to the time a recess was taken
at 5 o'clock this morning.
The excitement developed by the dispute
over the apportionment of State offices
cmor.g the three parties was heightened
by the springing of the Vice Presidential
question, and it reached the climax nt 4
o'clock this morning, when M. F. Har
rington, one of the leading Populists of
the \VÂ«*t. warned the convention that it
would wreck the party if they indorsed
the withdrawal of Towne from the ticket
and conceded to the Democratic demands.
Mr. Harrington asserted that the way to
Increase the mkldle-nf-the-road movement
was to throw Towne over and put in his
place one who had never been in sympa
thy with the Populists. He said Towne's
withdrawal would lose North Dakota,
South Dakota and Kansas, and the fuslon
ists would have to light for their lives in
Nebraska.
J. H. Edmlf=ton. chairman of the Popu
list State Central Committee and vice
chairman of the National Committee, was
even more radical. He declared that If the
Populists did not stand thoir ground and
hold their place on the national ticket and
insist on the bulk of the State officers they
could never hold another national conven
tion.
Just at a time when the sentiment
seemed strong for breaking away from all
alliances a motion to take a recess pre
vailed. The Democrats adjourned at the
same time and the leaders got together
for conference, with the result that the
Democrats yielded everything except one
jflice on the State ticket and divided with
the Populists and Free Silver Republicans
the fieht Presidential Electors.
Split Nearly Occurs, but Demo
crats Concede Everything
to Keep the Peace.

NAPA, July 12.â To-day's sport at the
track could be accounted the most suc
cessful of the meet. The crowd was a
large and enthusiastic one, the racing
passed off without hitch or accident of
any sort, while favorites in the betting
swept everything before them.
Dolllo Dillon; the Santa Rosa stock
farm representative, annexed the 2'19 trot
without raising a scrape, and gives prom
ise of being a two-tenner before the nay
crop is all gathered. In the running
events Sallie Goodwin, Sea Spray and Ki
Mido tramped in rirst to the intense dis
gust of Zlck Abrams, the bookmaker,
who took the evening train for home.
Helore betting began on the trot the

It strong that Dollie Dillon was a bail
breaker, however, ll did not prevent her
teinng a hot 10 to 4 favorite over the tield.
In the book betting Twilight ruled favor

If the latter mare ever was Inclined to
the "jimmy" habits, Mlliard baunuera
now lias her booked up right. Enjoying
three pieasant spins arouna the ellipse, in
one heat reaching the half in 1:U5*Â», the
mare was almost eased to a Jog In every
Instance at the wire, the best time sus
pended being 2:15Vi.
All Interest centered in the duel for sec
ond money between McNally and I>ora
Doe, the drst named horse proving the
better stayer and scoring.
The track, which is now In excellent
condition for the harness division, is In
clined to sore up the gallopers. The first
running recital was a four and a half fur
long jaunt for Sallie Goodwin, with "Chub"
Russell up, she being played from evens
to 1 to 2 fa\'orilism. It proved oil from
the can, fcr after Indulging Zem Zem with
the lead well on toward home Russell let
out a link and Sallie .downed the outsider
with ease. San Angustlne led a ragged
bunch out for show honors.
Henry Nathan chalked up 8 to 5 against

During the forencon Creamer tipped On
ward as a sure v.'Inner and Implored his
friends to place a bet or two on the dog's
chances in the lor.g odds book. As good as
25 to 1 could be had on Onward, but from
the light play it was evident that the
judge was airiest a!cnt> in his predictions.
The crowd, however, was pleased with the
outcome.
Many long scores were made and re

short-end players a run for "their money.
Chiarini Bros.' Zenobla beat iluller's
Moonstone In a rare In which thirty
points were scored. Moonstone led, but
while waftlrs for the hare to come to
him allowed his opponent to pile up points
and beat him to it. The talent fancied
Moonstone and made him a 5 to 1 favorite
to their sorrow.
White Fern was another good one for
the pikers. Drawn asainst Smuggler, the
wise ones thought thrre was "nothing to
it" and forced the despiÂ«ed one to the
short end at 10 to 1. White Fern did not
develop much speed, but showed clever
ness and an ambitious desire/ to reach the
game. When the white flae; was waved.
Fern was two points to the good. Sh*
was beaten pointless in the next round by
.Lord Hastings. *-
Aeneas boat Bill Foster, a 5 to 1 favor
ite, in the third round in a hard race
through favor of the hare. The work told
on him and he was withdrawn from the
stake. The saplings showed up better
than was expected.
Warpath, one of Curtis & 89ns* entries,
made an excellent showing, lie was least
thought of by the owners, but proved the
best of the new ones. Fair IJllle. though
not In the -best at condition, performed
well, as did Coronado aad Master Mat,
the runner-up.
Lord Hastings eot well down on the
card through clever running. At even
money in the first round he g-ot the flag
from Charter, Curtis' entry, in a heavily
played race.

Pursuant to orders from Washington
the camps at the Presidio are to be reno
vated and remodeled to provide accom
modation for 5000 men. As the fixtures of
last years' camp are still in position this
will prove an easy matter and will oc
cupy but a short time. The tents will be
in the majority of cases renewed. The
wooden buildings are to be made sanitary
and will probably be repainted. As the
materials needed are all close at hand
in the quartermasters' department, little
time will be wasted, and with a large
force of workmen it is intimated that the
entire Job can be done in little over forty
eight hours.
Even as things are at present 3000 men
could be accommodated without difficulty.
The additional room required Is accounted
for by the fact that the new army regu
lations call for companies of 125 men each
The air round the Presidio is electric
with rumor that all this preparation Is
significant of a rushing of troops to the
Orient. All through the big reservation
there is a busy hum of preparation, and
in a short time the while city of tents
may again develop in the hills of the
Presidio.

"Had the European embassies at Peking
taken the trouble to Investigate or even
to consider seriously the warnings about
the coming storm sent them by the mis
sionaries in the northern provinces the
awful events of the last month might have
been almost wholly averted," declared
Rev. AVilliam P. Chalfant, a Presbyterian
minister who returned from China on the
steamer Rio de Janeiro, when seen last
night.
The reverend gentleman has resided In
the North China province of Shantung
for fifteen years, and although he left the
Orient before the actual outbreak of hos
tilities on account of Mrs. Chalfant's
health, yet he is thoroughly familiar with
conditions In his recent home.
"The cause of the present situation,"
continued Rev. Mr. Chalfant, "had its in
cipiency three years ago. Two German
Catholic missionaries were murdered by
the common people. In return. the Ger
man Government asked for and obtained
the port of Tsung-Tau. A railroad was
constructed from the coast Into the in
terior. The Chinese, who are densely
Ignorant, believed that this was built to
aid the â¢foreign devils' In obtaining chil
dren, whose hearts they declared were
cut out and used to transform iron Into
money. They cannot understand where
we get our silver from, and that Is the ex
planation the priests give them."
It was just after thw agitation that Rev.
Mr. Chalfant and two of his colleagues
underwent a thrilling experience.
The minister, accompanied by Rev.
Charles A. Kille and Rev. W. S. Faris,
went up Into the mountains of lcanfu to
hold services in a church established
there. "While celebrating the ritual the
edllice was surrounded by a mob of howl-
Ing barbarians armed with knives, pitch
forks and old-fashioned guns. For a time
things looked black for the besieged, but
a native messenger managed to get
through and bring a detachment of sol
diery from a near-by town, which put the
mob to flight.
The Chinese soldier, according to Mr.
Chalfant, is well drilled and armed, and
though not particularly brave is possessed
of a fanatic fierceness whlcli makes an
excellent substitute for courage. This
fact, the missionary thinks, will be the
cause of u terrible death roll among the
allied forces. Mr. Chalfant says that he
fears* the worst fate has befallen the be
sieged in Peking.
"In China a native will risk his life
cheerfully for money," he said, "and
surely If those In Peking were safe they
would have got word through to their
friends. This continued silence Is tho
worst sign possible."

FINE STEAMER LAUNCHED
FOR THE RED STAR LINE
CONSIDERS HIS ESCAPE
ALMOST MIRACULOUS
Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, July 12.â An era of hot
weather ihat surpasses in intensity the
well-known period of drought during 1&92,
according to reports that are being
brought to Los Angeles, is sweeping over
the southern portion of Arizona. The heat
is so fierce that the deserts present a dried,
withered snd parched appearance, denud
ing the land of all feed for cattle.
To add to the suffering that Is entailed
upon former large herds, every water hole
and most wells, owing to a lack of sea
sonable rains, have completely gone dry.
In consequence cattle are dying by the
thousands, and their shrunken frames dot
the desert country of Pima, Plnal. Santa
Cruz. Yurr.a, Cochise and parts of Mari
copa counties. The loss to owners of herds
cannot be computed, as in their present
paunt condition no market can be found.
Old-timers assert that this mortality will
seriously affect the supply of beef upon
which California south of San Francisco
is largely dependent. Rarely in thÂ«% his
tory of the Territory has the water in the
Gila and Salt rivers been so scarce. Not a
drop is reported in the Gila, and in the
San Pedro from Benson to its confluence
with the Salt River above Phoenix. In the
Salt River, where thousands of Inches
formerly were known at similar periods,
U ss than one thousand inches are reported
for irrigating hundreds of thousands of
acres.
At Casa Grande the immense reservoir Is
dry, the supply having long since been ex
hausted. Crops of alfalfa, barley and
wheat between Florence and Casa Grande,
as well as on the Indian reservation at
Sacaton, where the Pimas dwell, are be
yond hope, even should rain now fall. Not
one-tenth of a harvest will be secured.
So dry is the air and so inflammable have
the forests on the Santa Catalinas become
that fire that is ravaging hundreds of
acres of timber adds a lamentable feature
to an existing chain of misfortunes.

PROPOSED ROUTE OF THE "CUT-OFF" LINE.
<=prRAVELEKS whose business or pleas
. ure makes It necessary to travel over
I! the coast division of the Southern
Pacific Company will read with satis
faction the announcement made yesterday
that the Southern Pacific has reached a
point of enterprise which calls for better
facilities with which to handle their traf
fic.
"Within the past few days suits have
been filed for the condemnation of lands
required for the roadway of the "shore
line" through certain lots dnd blocks in
the southern part of the city. This Is the
first definite move in a long time and
proves encouraging to those most particu
larly interested in the proposed improve- j
raent. Yesterday there was still better
news, in the announcement that the com
pany had called for bids for the construe,
tion of the new line. As to the date upon
which bids are to be opened, or the exact
surveyed course, the officials of the en
gineering department decline to give acy
information.
It was considered sufficient gocd news
for the public that the important piece
of work was about to be undertaken and
pushed to completion. The necessity for
condemnation suits accounts for the retl-
cence of the officials regarding the route
which the new line will take.
It is stated or good authority that the
foot of Seventh street will be the start
ing point, and that tho line will take the
most practical and direct course there
from, passing^ west of Railroad avenue
and not far from the old Bay View race
track. The first tunnel on the city end of
the road will extend about four blocks;;
thf*re will be several shorter tunnels.
This route will shorten the run to San
Jose materially and will avoid the heavy
grades and bad course of the present line,
on which there have been so many acci
dents. The new route will permit fast
iunninp: with safety. Its construction at
this time is a part of the purpose of the
company to straighten and perfect the
coast line to Los Angeles, which is in
tended to be eventually the main artery
of traffic between the northern and south
ern sections of the State. One of the
preat advantages to accrue from the com
pletion of this shore line will be the easy
access it will pive to the new railroad
yards In the Mission district. It Is said
thauthe greater portion of the overland
freight business will pass through these
yards.
The date for beginning- the construction
and the proposed completion of the road
will be announced when the contracts
shall have been awarded.
The Building Trades Council, which has
jurisdiction over twenty-eight labor un
ions of San Francisco, which unions have
a numerical strength of nearly 12,000 men,
has started on a campaign to force the
eight-hour rule upon employers In the
building trades where It does not now ob
tain. Notices have been sent out to em
ployers in the branches mentioned that
after August 13 the working day must be
but eight hours. *
The council stands behind the unions
directly interested, and a refusal on the
part of any of the employers might lead
to a strike that would stop all work on
buildings and in the factories that supply
the building trade. In consequence of
this possibility the trade is at a nervous
tension, and some builders are apprehen
sive that a general and disastrous strike
may result.
The Millmen's Union No. 423 of the
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners,
the Amalgamated Woodworkers' Union
No. 15 ar.d the Varn^-sliers' and Polishers'
Union No. 134 are the organizations that
have served norices^upon mills" and fac
tories employing men in those lines that
after August 13 a day's labor must con
sist of but eight hours?. The last named
union demands also in certain factories
an increase of 50 cents per day in wages.
All men employed on buildings in course
of construction are worked but eight
hours at present. The new demand Is an
attempt to extend the rule to the mills
and factories where the materials are
prepared that are used in building.
The Millmen's Union has a membership
of about -MX). They are the men that are
employed In thi- planing mills. In some
cases they are worked nine hours and in
others as long as ten hours.
The wocd-workers, commonly known as
cabinet-makers, have 300 men In their or
ganization, comprising n?arly all of the
cabinetmakers In San Francisco. Their
working day is nine hour* in most of the
larRe furniture lactories.
The varnisher* and polishers in some of
the factories are worked nine hours. In
others they have the eight-hour day, but
in these are paid 50 cents per day less.
The union demands, uniformly, a day of
eight hours and a wage of fi per day. It
has a membership of 125.
In addition to the demands of these
three unions, the Metal Roofers' Union
No. 1 has demanded an Increase from
$3 M per day to $4. The union has about
ninety members. The date set for the in
crease demanded is October 1. The con
tractors employing metal roofers show a
willingness to grant the increase. The
Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' Un
ion No. 07 has notified employers that
after October 1 the eight-hour day must
prevail in that branch of the building
trades. Nearly 200 men belong to that
union.
The unions have committees at work
with the employers, but no definite an
swer has been received except from a few
of them. They and most of the builders
believe that their demands will be
granted.
"There is little need to fear a general
st?.ke," W. M. VPage. secretary of the
Building Trades Council, said last even
ing. "If a few of the planing mill men re
fuse to accede to the demand their em
ployee will walk oul If they should at
tempt to defeat ua by sending their work
out of San Francisco, say to the Portland
mills, we would have to protect ourselves
by strikes of the employes of builders
using supplies furnished by them."

VANCOUVER. B. C, July 12.-The
Bteamer Mlowc ra from Sydney to-day
brings news that Great Britain has added
another to her Island possessions in the
Pacific. H. JJ. S. Porpoise in June piant
ed the British flug on Niue or Savage Isl
and, eituated 300 miles northeast of the
Tongan group. The principal product is
copra, of which 700 tons are exported an
nually.
The terms of the British protectorate
over Tonga have been modified as a re
sult of a conference between Basil
Thompson, the British representative, and
the Tongan King and chiefs, when an
agreement was signed by which no treaty
is to be made without Great BriuUn's con
sent. In case of the Tongan Government
being in need of assistance it is to apply
only to the British Government, and not
to anv other pjwer.
Advices from Apia say that the little
island of Nsufu. or Hope, has been com
pletely devastated by a disastrous hurri
cane which swept away oOo houses. Thir
ty-eight natives were killed. The cocoa
nut trees were entirely destroyed and the
natives are reported to be on the verge
of starvation.
Administrative matters appear to be
progressing satisfactorily in Samoa. The
Oicrman Governor. Dr. Solf. is installing
a system of native government, one of
th<- features of which is the election of
district Governors, who will confer pe-
riodkally with Solf and Head Chief Ma
taat'a.
The continued violence of the plague in
Australia is evidenced by the fact th>t up
to the time of the sailing of the Mio.vera
from Sydney the total number of cases
had reached an aggregate of 621, with
nlnetv-two deaths.
Premier Seddon of New Zealand is ad
vocating the including of his colony in the
Australian federation. He also urges the
federation of the Fiji Islands with the
idea of ultimately bringing them into the
same scheme of union. He thinks this
will be necessary to prevent the Fiji Isl
ands falling into the hands of some na
tion other than Great Britain.

HOW FLIES OVER
SAVAGE ISLAND
PRETORIA. July 12.-Colonel Mahon,
reinforced by General French's brigade,
yesterday took all the positions held by
the Boers in the neighborhood of Rtit
fonte!n. A number of Boer dead were
found. The British casualties were
trif.ir.g.
Details are now 2t hand regarding th?
disaster to the Lincolnshire Regiment on
Wednesday. It appears that five com
panies were ordered Tuesday to proceed
and hold the pass through Magaiesbur^,
in the neighborhood of Daspoort fort.
They arrived at the pass in the afternoon,
when three companies with two guns took
up a position ar.d camped for tne night,
leaving two companies on a plain souttj
cf the pass. The eastern hill was rugged,
rocky a:.<i inaccessible, but farther east
apparently approachable from the mail:
ridge. At daybreak yesterday the Boers
appeared on the eastern kopje and opened
a heavy f:re. Confusion ensued. The col
onel ordered the men to take up a position
on a. kopje west of the gap. From this
point a hot nre ensued during the entire
cay. Two guns under the escort of th-3
Bcota Greys placed in advance from the
main body were captured after a stout
resistance. Nearly every man was killed
or wounded. A Maxim gun was brought
into action early in the day. The lire
was too hot and the men were iinally
forced to retire. A sergeant, aided by
seven volunteers, saved the gun. There
was a continuous fire all along the line,
the Lincolnshire Regiment men vigor
ously replying.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
Boers appeared to the left of the position
occupied by the British. An officer and
fifteen mm attempted to charge them.
Fourteen men \vÂ«re killed or wounded as
the result of the charge. Three companies
were practically surrounded, but they
kept up a steady fire unwaveringly until
toward nightJali. when their ammunition
had been expended.
It is understood upon good authority
that the Boers have armed natives.
Two cf the natives leaj>ed from co\-er
when a small party irom the Lin
colnshire Regiment stepped up and de
yianced their surrender. A soldier stepped
forward and Knot both the natives dead.
Dne officer who succeeded in making his
pscape had an encounter with an armed
native. It is feared that the losses of the
British were numerous. About thirty of
the Hritifh soldi.rs straggled back to
ramp to-day. According to all accounts
I great force is being assembled to pre
rent further progress cf the Boers.
LONDON CONSIDERS THE
SITUATION AS SERIOUS
LONDON. July 13.â Lord Roberts' dis
satch reporting still another unfortunate
jeeurrence throws a serious light upon
J-.e state of affairs in South Africa. There
aas been some comment recently regard
jig the virtual absence of progress by

Lord Roberts, and but few could have
Â»een found to believe that the scattered
3oers were able to inflict such a defeat so

LONDON. July 12.â Lord Roberts re
ports to the War Oflice under date of Pre
toria. July 12. as follows:
"The enemy, having failed in their at
tack upon our right rear, as mentioned
in my telegram of July 9. made a deter
mined attack upon our right fiank yester
day* and, I regret to say, succeeded in
capturing Nitrals Nek. which was gar
risoned by a squadron of the Scots Greys,
with two guns of a battery of the Royal
Artillery and five companies of the Lin
colnshire regiment.
Â¦"The enemy attacked in superior num
bers l.1 dav.-n, and seizing the hills com
manding the nek. brought a heavy gun
fire to bear upon the Mnall garrison.
'"Nitrals Nek is about eighteen miles
from here, near where the road crosses
the Crocodile River. It was held by us
in order to maintain road and telegraphic
communication wuh Ruste-riberg.
"The lighting lasted, more or less,
throughout the day ar.d immediately on
receiving information this morning of the
enemy's strength 1 dispatched reinforce
ments from here ur.der Colonel Godfrev of
the Kings Own Scottish Borderers. Be
fore, however, they reached the spot the

their hoi see bvir.fr phot; also about ninety
rr.cn of the Lincolnshire regiment.
"A list Of the casualties has not been re

"Simultaneously an attack was made on
our ouii>osts near Durdepoort, north of
the town, in which the Seventh Dragoons
were encased. The regiment was handled
with considerable skill by Lieutenant
Colonel Low and ljept the enemy in check
until they retired on their supports and

Warrant for Joe McAuliffe.
Patrick Walsh, head keeper In the
Sheriff's office, had a warrant issued for
the : arrest of Joe McAuliffe. an ex-prlze
fighter. on a charge of battery yester
day. In his complaint sworn to before
Judse Fritz, Walsh declares that on
Wednesday night McAuliffe approached
him at Sixth and Market streets and
asked for the loan of a dollar. Walsh
told the pugilist that he did not have the
amount, but offered to buy a drink. Mc-
Auliffe told Walsh he had the money, but
did not want to lend It. and emphasized
his opinion by knocking Walsh down Â¦with
a- left swing. Walsh hurried to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where, under the name
of John Jones, he had a fracture of the
nose reduced and a. battered face put in
presentable shape. McAuliffe Is still at
la rtre.
Hit Him "With a Lamp
During a disagreement between E. A.
Collins and his wife in their home at 1*5
Minna street a lamp was hurled by the
woman and the head of the household was
later treated at the Harbor Receiving
Hospital for several severe lacerations of
the scalp. Luckily the lamp was not
lighted, or a tragedy might have been the
result. According to the woman's atory.
words had failed to properly express her
side of a heated argument and she
thought the heavy missile might forcibly
impress upon her husband what she wish
ed to imply. No arrests were made.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, July 12.â H. M. S. Porpoise has been on- another
adventurous tour through the Islands of the South Pacific. She returned to
Sydney, Australia, a few days before the steamer Miowera sailed from that
port, reporting that the famous disappearing: island of the Tonga group had
again moved up Into the sphere of human vision. It was known as Falcon
Island in the eighties, when the stars and stripes were planted upon It.
The island Is high in the center, which, according to the officers of the
Porpoise, proved that it was the erupted top of a submarine volcano. In 1882
the island was in violent eruption, being overhung by a dense cloud of smoke.
Afterward the island increased rapidly in size and was covered with Â¦ vegeta-*
tlon. A few years ago it totally disappeared off the face of the waters and
until two months ago it had literally dropped out of, existence.
The island is a sort of mysterious place, according to the natives, but
they are nevertheless moving back on it and erecting huts around the base
of the central mound.
FAMOUS FALCON ISLAND
AGAIN HEAVES INTO SIGHT
Peter Harkins, a Billposter, Arrested
for Threatening to Kill His
Young Spouse.
Peter Harkins. a billposter, was arrested
yesterday and booked at the City Prison
on a charge of threats to kill. The com
plaining witness Is Harkins' young wife
Delia. She was married when IB years of
ace and is now only 24 and has two chil
drenâa girl five years of age and a boy
of two years.
About eleven months ago Harkins broke
his arm, and the young wife was com
pelled to work to support the family.
When Harkins' arm was all right again
some months ago he refused to go to
work, and his wife finally became tired
of keeping him in food and clothes. There
was a row and she left him, and taking
the children went to livts at 322 Fifth
street.
Since then Harkins. according to his
Â¦wife, has been persecuting her. and last
Friday, she says, he seized her by the
throat and threatened to kill her and the
children. He repeated his threats
"Wednesday night, and yesterday morning
Mrs. Harkins was forced to ask a police
man to escort her to the City Hall, as she
was mortally afraid of meeting her hus
band. She swore to the warrant for his
arrest before Judge Conlan. and the po
liceman to whom the warrant was given
to serve found Harkins watching the
house where his wife lives.

THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.Some of the ill-mated couples of California, who
have found marriage a failure, may find some consola
tion in the fact that the contradictory opinions of
Judges Hebbard and Belcher lend color to the theory
that marriage is not as stable as it might be.
It is now reported that some of the Alaskan In
dians have dug up the war hatchet; and the objection
on the part of the heathen to any further extension of
civilization seems to be growing all over Asia, Africa
Bryan, Stevenson and Towne had a grand rally at
Lincoln the other night, and showed a good deal of
enthusiasm over their nominations, so we may now
consider the campaign in Nebraska to be wide open.
We would advise no man in good business to go
to Nome on a venture, but Golonel Bryanwould do
better to go there and work for gold than to stay
at home and yell /or free silver. . â¢
One of our local judges is convinced that we ought
to have a national law governing marriage. Under
such a law what in the world would become of our
Sulu fellow citizens?
DEMOCRACY, WHERE fiRT THOU?
THERH has been what may be called a carnival
of ratification in Lincoln. Colonel Bryan and
Mr. Stevenson have been ratified and ratifying
three t:mc- a <hy. morning, afternoon and evening!.
They ha\e hern ably assisted by Cyclone Davis of
Texas. J. Webster Davis of Missouri. General Tame.
}'.. Weaver of Iowa, ar.d Hon. C. A. Towne of Minne
sota. Al] of the-^ gentlemen have tnndc speeches,
gestures, sipns r.tid tokens to the populace. They
have settled and adjusted the policy of the party, the
nation and t?ie world for prncnitior.s to come, and
Bryan and have foregathered with them on
terms of hob and nob. Stevenson has said twice that
he must not say too much in the presence of the nevt
President of the United States, and Colonel Bryan
has told of !io.v awe-inspiring it is to stand before the
next Vice President.
All this is finer than silk, but where are the Demo
crats? Cyclone Davis is a Texas Populist, a promi
rent competitor of Boreas, god of the winds. Weaver
i> a PopuliÂ«t. J. Webster Davis is a Republican, who
carries with him a turbid and tropical vocabulary, and
fc.-.c joined three who denounce the army and navy
because McKmley would r.ot employ both in the
IWr war. Mr. Towne is a Silver Republican.
Where are the Democrats? The feast of ratification
and fiow of prat ific.it ion at Lincoln are Populistic,
Silver Republican and J. Webster Davisian rather
than Democratic

following explanation of 16 to 1: The
phrase "16 to 1." as applied to coinage,
means that the mint value of sixteen ounces
of silver shall be equal to the mint value
of one ounce of gold; that it?. ?Kit sixteen
ounces of silver shall be colnable into as
many silver dollars as one ounce of gold
is coinable into standard silver dollars.

in a game of crlbbage "A claims that
making fifteen counts two and playing
the last card of the deal entitles him to
one more point, three in all," his claim
is correct. If he also claim3 that "in
making 31 he is not entitled to more than
two, but that in playing the last card of
the last deal he is entitled to one more
for last card," he is also correct as to
that.

WILL the British empire establish a protective
tariff for the benefit of the colonies against the
world? That is a question that is rapidly rising
to be an important one in British politics. It has
been under discussion for some years, but was never
given any great prominence until the outburst of the
new imperial sentiment caused by the South African
war. Since that time, however, it has been taken up
both in the mother country and in the colonies, and
is developing considerable strength.
At the recent congress of the Chambers of Com
merce of the empire the subject engaged most of the
attention of the meeting. The colonial representatives
as a rule were strongly~in favor of it. while those from
the famous free trade cities of Manchester and Bir
mingham were opposed to it. The chief speech was
that of President Ritchie of the Imperial Board of
Trade. He spoke with official responsibility and was
guarded in his utterances, hut said enough to show a
willingness to take some steps toward satisfying the
colonies. He is reported by the London Chronicle
as saying: "He believed that tlie days of the strict
free trade Manchester school were passing away. He
did not want to mislead them. He did not want them
to infer that this country was likely to depart from
this free trade policy, but he thought, putting a rea
sonable construction on this policy, there might yet
be closer commercial connection in the future than
at present exists within the empire, and he hoped it
might be brought about without the sacrifice of the
fundamental principles of free trade, which have
guided the commercial policy of this country for so
many years past."
After an elaborate discussion there was adopted n
j resolution declaring: ''That this congress urp;es upon
her Majesty's Government the appointment bj- them
of a Royal Commission, composed of representatives
of Great Britain and her colonies and India, to con
sider the possibilities of increasing and strengthening
the trade relations between the different portions of
thi empire ; and that the chair nominate a representa
tive deputation to wait upon the Premier, the Secre
tary of State for the Colonies and the president of the
Hoard of Trade, and lay the question fully before
i thorn."
The British manufacturers would of course like to
have a protected market for themselves in the colo-
I nies. but they are hardly willing to grant protection
for colonial goods in return. Cheap raw materials
and cheap food are necessities tor people of the
mother country, and it will require very strong rea
sons to induce them to put a protective tax upon such
nrticle*. That is the view of the case taken by the
Chronicle itself, and iii commenting upon the resolu
lion.and the debate it says: "There is. of course, no
reason why the commercial bonds which unite us to
the colonies should not be drawn more tightly, ex
cept the implied expectation qn the part of the colo
rteÂ«: that a close ring shall be formed excluding out
siders. This is all very well for the colonies, who oc
cupy the place of producers, hut England is a nation
of consumers. By no possibility can we feed our
j selves, and all the articles we require are not to be
j had as abundantly and as cheaply from the colonies
ns from foreign countries. In discriminating aj?ainÂ«t
those countries, therefore, we raise the price of the
food we eat ourselves and of the raw material we re
quire for our manufactures. In refusing cheap sugar
we diminish the amount of nourishment obtainable by
BRITISH IMPERIAL TRADE.

THE CHARLESTON CONFERENCE.
IZZ^ ROM every point of view it is gratifying
that the attendance upon the National Ed
ucational Association Convention at Charles
ton is sufficiently large and notable to render
the gathering one of the most influential of its
kind. The Southern leaders have made earnest
efforts in the cause of public education since the
war, and have achieved much success; but they
have been heavily handicapped by the poverty of their
States, the indifference of many of the poor whites
to the advantages of education, and the necessity of
maintaining two sets of schoolst one for whites and
one for blacks. Thus the South is far behind other
sections of the Union in school matters, and the peo
ple there need every encouragement which can be
given them in their educational work.
At the recent conference on "Education at the South,"'
! held at Capon Springs, West Virginia, much stress
was laid upon the backward condition of the schools
and collegers of that section and the large percentage
of illiteracy among the people. In the six New Eng
j land States and in New York, New Jersey and Penn
sylvania, the average illiteracy in 1800 among the
native white population over ten years of age was
i only 2.31, and among the colored population 21.71.
At the same period in the Southern States the per
centage of illiteracy was:
Whito. Colored.
Alabama 1S.4J CP.OS
Arkansas 16.5t> TA.do
Florida 11.31 50 5S
Georgia 16.51 f?7.27
Louisiana 2.1.3.J 72.14
Mississippi : 11.92 eo.Pl
North Carolina 23.10 **O.0l
South Carolina 1S.11 64.07
Tennessee *. . 17.PS 54.22
Texas 8.2S 52.50
Virginia 13.9S 57.21
From the contrast between the statistics for the
New England and the Middle States and those for
the South it will be seen how far the Southern peo
ple have to progress in school matters before they
are abreast with the rest of the republic. Fortunately
the outlook is encouraging. As was stated at the
Capon conference by the Rev. G. S. Dickerman of
New Haven:
Much more Interest Is shown among Southern teach
i pts In the onmlnp National Educational Association
I meotlnjr In Charleston than among: Northern teachers.
| The educational spirit is abroad in the land, and schools
are discussed in hotels and on cars and steamboats;
larger appropriations are asked and granted, and the
' school is eominjr Â«o bo looked upon as a. defense against
I the disorders of society and the promoter of gonsral
j prosperity.
The dignity and importance of the convention at
Charleston will of course aid in stimulating Southern
interest in educational problems, and the Northern
educators who at this season of the year have gone
i to that far Southern city to attend the convention.
I arc doing a valuable service to the republic â a service
j which the citizens of Charleston have given ample
j evidence of appreciating.
THE SULLIVAN ESTATE CflSE
BY the confession of Chretien the charges of The
Call concerning the conspiracy to take posses
sion of the estate oi Joseph Suilivan have been
proven beyond a doubt. That coniession. however,
was r.ot needed to ?ti5tain the charges. It came,
in fact, because the charge* had been proven by ample
testimony, and because further attempts at conceal
ment would have been futile. The only value of the
confession is that it completes the exposure of the
crime and reveals the thoroughness of the victory
which The Call has obtained in its efforts for justice.
Now that the exposure has been made and full
proof of the crime hr.s been brought forward, the
work of The Call in the case is closed. It is for the
bench and the bar to determine what shail next be
done, and what punishment shall be inflicted upon the
gt: ; Ity parties. Against none of the persons involved
in the conspiracy has The Call any personal animosity.
It has no prejudice or spite to serve in prosecuting
them. What it did in exposing the conspiracy was
done solely in the interests of justice and for the pub
lic welfare. It has. therefore, nothing further to add
to the affair than to point out how imperative it is
for the court to sec to it that the guilty parties be
brought to answer for their crimes with all possible
promptness.
The people of California have confidence in their
courts. They are aware how grave would be the peril to
society if that confidence were destroyed, and nothing
will be done by the people or by the leKitimffte press
that represents public sentiment to weaken the popu
lar belief in the essential justice of court proceedings.
It is not to be denied, however, that much has been
Â«lone by the bar and by the bench to lead to wide
spread suspicions of injustice and malpractice. Many
an cstntc has been so wasted in our courts as to con
stitute a serious scandal, and it is well known that
â¢ again and afrain there have been open charges of fraud
in such matters.
An impressive illustration of the ext'ent to which
suspicion lias attached to probate matters in this city
was rfTorded by the statement made by Joseph S.'
Tobin, attorney for the Hibcrnia Bank, in submitting
the records of the bank as evidence in the case. He
is quoted as having said that he wished the court to
understand that the bank had answered only through
courtesy the summons to bring the records into
court, and not to create a precedent for further de
mands, because the bank had found it absolutely
necessary to keep tucta records away from the
eyes of scheming lawyers eager to obtain information
which would enable them to steal estates.
A statement of that kind is not to be pa^cd over
lightly. It come* from a responsible source and in
timates that the robbing of the estates of the dead is
something of a practice nniong certain kinds of prac
titioners at the bar. It goes far to confirm suspicions
raided by many developments in noted cases that are
ftill fresh in the minds of men. and can hardly fail
to serve the bench and the bar as a warning of the ex
tent to which court proceedings have lost the confi
dence of careful business men.
If there be any business intrusted to them of which
Judges shou'd be more careful than usual it is that
of estates of the dead whose heirs arc absent and not
ab'e to defend their interest?. The robbing of Mich
estates by fraudulent practices tinder the form? of law
and by members of the bar is one of the pravest of
offences apsinct society. The exposure of such wrongs
is one of the most important services a newspaper can
render a community, and the punishment of the crime
is a re*nr>nÂ«ibilÂ»ty which a hitrli sense of dutv will
compel the bench and the bur alike to carry out in the
spirit of the words of Grant. "Let no guilty mail es
cape."

POLITICAL PARASITES.
UPON every political party that has any chance of
success at the polls. a gang of hungry parasites
attaches itself. As the chances for power and
patronage increase the number and the voracity of the
parasites increase. Thus it is inevitable that as the
Republican party in San Francisco has now ever}'
prospect of electing every ticket it puts in the field,
the number of scheming and greedy self-seekejs at
taching themselves to it should be large.' In fact, so
rhariy of these hangers on, taxeaters and boodlers
have fastened here and there upon the party that
their presence constitutes a serious menace to the wel
fare of the organization. They lessen the chances of
that very victory by which they hope to profit.
Chief among the dangerous parasites, of the party
i* the saloon following of toughs and touts under the
bossdom of Crimmins and Kelly. The two bosses are
vcrj willing to make use of any kind of tool that can
be serviceable to the purposes they have in view. It
mntters nothing to them whether the gang are Repub
licans or not so long as they can be enrolled in Re
publican clubs and have the privilege of voting for
officers. Any kind of a vote that will help the bosses
to elect a delegate to the county convention suits
them. They arc in politics not for "the principle of
the thing," nor for their health. They are "out for
the stuff" and "in for the spoils," and if any induce
ment were offered them would as soon knife the
party ticket on election day as help it.
Ample evidence has been given that the people of
San Francisco will not any longer submit to boss
domination, and will oppose any ticket that is sus
pected of being dominated or nominated by the bosses
of the ward gangs. The very appearance of the
saloon push and pull at a Republican convention
would weaken the whole ticket. Nothing is to be
gained by compromising with a set of men whose
very profession of being Republicans is itself compro
mising to the party. What would it profit Republi
canism to make terms with Crimmins and Kelly and
lose the support of hundreds of independent voters
who will not tolerate boss politics? x
This is a Republican year. Public sentiment is
overwhelmingly for McKinley and Roosevelt on the
platform of prosperity against Bryan and Stevenson
on ?. platform of calamity and denunciation. It may
be that some Republicans are sanguine that the favor
with which the national ticket is regarded is so strong
that it will carry the local tickets to victory even if
yellow dogs be permitted to dominate them. If such
sanguine expectations exist., the sooner they are
abandoned the better. San Francisco Republicanism
is strong enough to carry almost anything just now.
but it cannot carry Crimmins and Kelly farther than
the nearest dumping-ground, slaughter-house or
graveyard.
OUR ATTITUDE IN CHIN0.
THE country will be highly gratified by the an
nouncement of the position of the United States
in the current troubles in China. Secretary Hay
ratifies the world that we are there simply to protect j
the life and property of our citizens, and that this is I
our right under the treaties with China, and that we j
will not only not participate in a partition of that em- J
pirc. and the destruction of its polity, but will look t
upon such a proceeding with disfavor. Mindful of
our duty to cur citizens and the maintenance of our
treaty rights, we could do no Jess; and mindful of
justice, and the international rights of the Chinese
empire, we could not with decency and self-respect do j
more.
It is well to say to the critics of the administration
that from their ranks issue the-most cries against the
foreign policy of our Government directed to the pro
tection of its citizens abroad. They arc the people
who foment discontent in home politics by lamenting
daily and without ceasing the weakness of our policy j
abroad. Within the last thirty years this style of criti- j
cism has been heard about affairs in the Spanish
West Indies, in Guatemala, in Brazil, in Russia and
elsewhere on the face of the earth where proper re
spect for the rights of our citizens abroad has failed
oi observance.
These decriers of their own Government have been
at the same time ready, as they prove to be now.^o.
raise a still louder outcry against the employment of
a fleet and an army to enforce the rights of our people.
They forget that in dealing in such matters with
other nations no heed is paid to any request of that
kind unless the delinquent Government is aware that
we huve not only the fleets and the forces to back our
demand, but that we will not hesitate to use them. To
do this we must have them ready for use. But when
this is proposed the finical advocates of a vigorous
foreign policy cry out against a standing army, and
prolessionally shake in their shoe leather about mili
tarism and the destruction of our liberties by an army!
According to their divergent theories and discordant
cries, the protection of our citizens abroad is incom
patible with the enjoyment of liberty at home.
This Chinese affair has offered an opportunity to
exhibit this policy. If the administration sat still and
did nothing the echoes would have roared back the
howling of this class of men. denouncing their Gov
ernment for its F.upineness while Americans were
being murdered, drawn and quartered by Mongol bar
barians. But the Government acted with promptness,
firmness and excellent judgment.
President McKinley made it plain that \ve were
armed and in China not as aggressors, nor with an
ultimate purpose to aggrandize territory, nor for any
secondary motive whatever, but simply to protect our
people domiciled there in pursuance of treaty rights.
Already the cry is abroad that President McKinley
is making war upon China without authority of Con
gress that he is a '"Dictator." an "Emperor,'* and all
such driveling rot.
It is probable that so far as the excited Chinese
mob is able to discriminate, the strong and temper
ate attitude of the Pres ; dcnt, its perfect justice and its
respect for the polity and position of China, will be
found to have saved the lives of Americans there
when the people of the carving-knife nations have
been sacrificed.
There is no doubt that the slaughter of the German
Minister was caused by Chinese rage at the lawless ag
gression of Germany on the Gulf of Pcchili.
The President and Secretary Hay have acted with
the greatest wisdom in a sudden emergency, and the
position they have c.~.used this Government to take
has made a deep impression upon the policy of othe
rations.
our poorer classes. We fear, therefore, we can hardly
go all the way with the colonies in the prosecution of
these aims."'

mits Suicide in Jail.
Yee Tong Look, a Chinaman who had
been denied a landing by Customs Col
lector Jackson, committed suicide last
Wednesday night by hanging himself to
the wicket of his cell in the County Jail
on Broadway. The discovery was made
bv three Chinese prisoners who occupied
the same cell with him. Their Outcries
attracted the attention of the jail officials,
who. upon examining the body, found that
the man nnd been dead for several hours.
Look's attorney had procured a writ of
habeas corpus on his behalf on June 27.
alleging that the Chinaman was a native
of California. The Chinaman was thought
to* be mentally deranged, for he had at
tempted suicide once before by jumping
into the bay from the steamer alongside

There wero serious doubts in many
minds even at the beginning of the pres
ent generation that the barriers of moun
tains, swamps and rivers could be over

the Union, contending that the term of a
representative from that remote region
woujd expire before he could reach the

The building of railroads progressed
rapidly in the United States. In 1S2S
Charles Carroll, last surviving signer of
the Declaration of Independence, laid the
first rail of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
way. In IS30 there were twenty-three
miles of railroad. Te-day. seventy years
later, there are tnough miles of railroad
in the republic, counting, terminals and
sidings, to build a, track from this planet
to the moon, with 6000 miles left over. It
is difficult to realize what this enormous
mileage of railroads means. It has open-
Early in the century, amid the clamor
ing for better highways, there were tho
demonstrations and prophecies of a few
men of genius who had dabbled In steam
and felt the throb of the power that was
to harness the world's trallic to elemental
forces, overthrow the customs of cen
turies and bring men and nations closer
together.
If this were an account of the develop
ment of transportation, rather than a gen
eral review of the growth of means and
methods of communication, more par
ticular attention might be oaid to the
achievements of Oliver Evans, who de
voted a lifetime of unappreciated effort to
the proposition that steam might be made
to furnish motive power to boats and
wagons; to John Filch, who propelled his
steam craft on the Delaware: to Robert
Fulton and to Stephenson: but only Inci
dental mention can be made of the build
ing of railways and steamships, although
they are perhaps the most important ele
ment in the system of communication.
distant "Stony Mountains" of Louisiana
would ever t$ke their seats In the capito!
nt Washington. And yet there came a
time when, at the darkest hour In all our
history, the building ot transcontinental
railroads was advocated as a means of
binding the East to the West; and we of
this day have witnessed the marriage of
these great sections by the strong bonds
of steel, which span the continent from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
The court refused to award punitive
damages in the sum of $1000. as prayed
for. for tho reason that the employe is
personally punishable for the crime of
sending the forpred telegram, and the com
pany should not be punished for that of
which it is not guilty.
Vlewfngr the facts of the case at bar In the
llKht of the doctrines above enunciated, it Is
Kpparent that, although the act of Mtnkler In
?tallty exceeded the scope of his employment
as contemplated by his employer. It was an act
which would have been lawful If it had been
honest: it was committed while he was en-
KHRed in nnd about the business assigned to
him, and It w-as by reason of such assignment
and the charater of the duties he was re
quired to perform that he was enabled with the
assiFtance of a confederate to commit the fraud
upon the plaintiff. â¢ * â¢
Under such circumstances as these. If the
principal could secure immunity from the
fraudulent acts of Its agent, tho <'onfldenr"e and
security necessarily rejxiscd in the operations
of telegraph eomp.-inles would he utteriy de

Importance rendered worthless, as public cor
porations of that character would serve as a
too ready means of subterfuge for the weak and
criminal- minded.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow de
cided yesterday that a telegraph com
pany must make good the money paid by
a bank on a ftyged telegram sent by one
of the company s employes. The case was
that of the Bank of Palo Alto against the
Pacific Postal Telegraph Cable Company
to recover $840 paid on a forged telegram,
?23 34 expenses, $250 attorney fees and $1000
punitive damages. Judge Morrow award
ed all the sums asked except the $1000
punitive damages.
The facts are these: On December 27,
189S. the Bank of Palo Alto received a dis
patch dated from Los Angeles, the body
of which .read as follows:
Please pay Harry L. Cato JS40. Waive iden
tification. We remit to-day.
FARMERS' AND MERCHANTS' BANK.
The money was paid by the bank to
Cator, who was a confederate of L.ee D.
Minkler, an operator In the San Francisco
ofiice of the defendant. Minkler was
proved to be the author of the forged tele
gram sent to the bank.
In rendering his decision Judge Morrow
said that the first question to be deter
mined was whether under the facts of the
case the telegraph company was respon
sible for the wrongful act of its employe
In sending the false telegram. After re
citing the facts in the case the decision
goes on to state: \
' Plaintiff contends that tile defendant Is
responsible for these acts of Minkler under the
law as contained in article 2338 of the Civil
Code of California. This section provides that
unles-s required by or under the authority of
law to employ that particular agent, a prlncl
ral is responsible to third persons for the negli
gence ctf his agent in the transaction of the
business of the agency, including wrongful acts
committed by such agent in and as a part of
th# transaction of surh business.
Judge Morrow then cited several similar
cases in which telegraph companies were
held responsible, using the following lan
guage:
Where the business with which the agent Is
Intruftefl Involves a fluty owed by the master
to the public or third persons. If the- agent,
while so employed, by his own wrongful act
occasions n violation of that duty or an Injury
to the pprson lntereft^d in its faithful per
formance by or on behalf of the master, the
master Is liable for the breach of It, whether it
be founded In contract or be a common law
duty growing out of the relations of the par
ties. ' And it is immaterial In such case that
the. wrongful act of the servant is in itself will
ful, malicious or fraudulent. â¢ â¢ â¢

tained on Account of the Wrong
doing of a Trusted
Employe.

They go there on the Zealandia at the
invitation of the Hawaiian Islamites to
establish a new temple and to initiate
several new members.
At a meeting held on Wednesday night in
Golden Gate Hall the Mystics discussed
the question of the excursion and decided
unanimously in favor of it. Potentate
Hurlbut was authorized to appoint com
mittees to contribute toward the success
ful carrying out of the proposed excur

The Zealandia will convey the Nobles to
their goal, and as a measure of prepara
tion for the trip she has been placed on
the dry dock to undergo a thorough over
hauling.
The steamship company has graciously
granted the excursionists privilege to sail
on a regular steamer October 3, provided
return trip is made on the Zealandia, and
likewise permission to remain at the isl

extra charge.
The inducements for Shriners to make
this trip, aside from .the general and well

The Mistley Hall left Liverpool for San
Francisco on February 2S, and about ten
days later was spoken in latitude 3S north,
longitude 12 west. She was not heard
from again until the 9th inst., when the
news came from London that she had
been towed Into Montevideo dismasted.
Private advices received by the Mer
chants' Exchange state that the Mistley
Hall was caught in a terrific storm on
June 2 in latitude 58 south, longitude 63
west. The main and mlzzen masts went
by the board and the foretopmast car
ried away. Everything movable on deck
was washed away; the bulwarks were
stove, decks strained, boats smashed into
kindiins? wood and, worst of all, three
members of the crew lost their lives. The
cargo shifted, and in order to straighten
the vessel up Captain Logan had to Jet
tison 100 tons of frieght.
The MLstley Hall is well known in the
San Francisco trade. She has been com
ing here for years and every man on the
front, knows her as well as he knows the
Oakland ferry-boats, it will be many a
long day before she is seen in the bay
again, however. The work of repairing
her will be a long and expensive affair,
as the new masts and yards will have to
be sent out from England. Then the ves
sel is old. and the question will be sure
to arise as to whether the expense of
makiuR her seaworthy agrain would be
justified. She Is owned by the Globe Ship
ping Company of Liverpool and was built
in 1874. She is 1867 tons net burden, 2C.0
feet long 1 . 42 feet 3 inches broad and 23
feet S inches deep. She carries a general
cargo, nearly all of which will be more or
less damaged.
The British ship Mistley Hall, now in
Montevideo, had a terrible time of it on
June 2 last. She was almost entirely dis
masted, three of the crew were killed or
drowned and when the gale blew itself
out the vessel was almost a wreck. It Is

"And the jury expressly disapproves of
the negligence shown in the treatment of
the case at the hotel before removal to
the hospital."
Autopsy Surgeon Iceland testified yes
terday. In accordance with his previous
Â«!aterr;ent, that in his opinion Stadie's
death resulted from scalding, for imme
diately after the removal of the botiy to
the Morgue it was found that two-tmro.3
of the skin had peek-d off from the ef
forts of the hot water.
On the witness stand Dr. Noble admit
ted that he had been so busy preparing
antidotes for Stadie that he had not found
time to take the temperature of the water
in which he had ordered his assistants to
plao? the patient, but he did not think
that the water was too hot.
William Lawrence ai.d William Isaacs,
the painters who assisted Dr. Noble in
hlfl efforts to resuscitate Stadie. testified
that they had prepared the bath under the
doctor's* orders and placed the uncon
scious man in it. keeping him there for
about ten minutes. Both men testified that
they had placed their hands in the water
during the operation and had not noticed
that it was uncomfortably hot. After
ward they lashed Stadie's naked body with
wet towels and shouted Into his ears in
order to try to awaken him.
The jury returned a verdict that death
was due to opium taken with suicidal in

their verdict:

The postal establishment has grown
frum aimust nothing to be the greatest
business concern in the world. Its re
ceipts for the carriage of all kinds of mail
matter now a?;gregaie almost $lti'.>,0tiO.t.*Â» a
year, and it speodq a little more, for the
effort la to provide- means ol quick com
munication between citizen and citizen,
rather than to make the service self-sus

offices in the United States, and the serv
ice has more than ixcj.txw employes. It
handles approximately T.OOO.O'O.Oou pieces
of mail matter every year, OIL which 3,000.-
OOO.m.v are letters. This vast /business ha*
witnessed a marvelous growth. It is a
reflection of the no less wonderful devel
opment cf the United States. The figures
above given are incomprehensible and
hardly to be believed when comparison is
made with the postal service a hundred
years ago. "When Timothy Pickering
served as Postmaster General in Wash
ington's administration," says Postmas
ter General Smith, "his balance sheet of
expenditures and receipts for a wholo
quarter of a year showed an aggregate of
JtS.OOO, which is the expenditure of every

In this day we do not wait for the slow
stage coach of our ancestors, carrying thÂ«
fortnightly mails, but even in the rural
districts there are daily deliveries of let
ters at the very door, and in the cities
there are hourly deliveries. Fast mail
trains have succeeded the old coach, which
lumbered over corduroy roads, or was de
layed long hours in the mire, and if to
day the ordinary service, rapid as it is.
Is not sufficiently swift we are permitted
the convenience of special deliveries, by
which, upon the payment of a small tec.
our own little affairs receive particular
care by the Government.
But. marvel as we may at the complete
ness and efficiency of the present postal
system, compared with that of the early
days, there are still greater wonders.
Prior to isoo a fe-w scientists In Europe
and America had caught scattering sparks
of the power that was in the twinkling of
an eye to flash human thought around thÂ»
world. Le Sage in Geneva and Betan
court In Spain had sent fluttering mes
sages over wires with power furnished by
a battery of Leyden jars. Then, in 1SO\
followed Volta. who won the plaudits of
Napoleon and 2000 crowns by demonstrat
ing the use of his galvanic pile. From
this famous scientist of Pavia to Samuel
Morse the history of electrical Inventions,
improvements and discoveries is brilliant
with illustrious names, many of which,
like Ohm. Ampere. Oersted, Faraday and
Henry, have been Incorporated in the
technical language that has grown about
the battery and the dynamo. Among all
these there is no greater name tfian that
of Morse. On May 27, 1844. the first intel
ligible communication sent over a consid
erable distance was flashed from th<Â»
American capital to Baltimore. The dots
and dashes of the mysterious system that
spelled the famous message. "What hath
God wrought ?" have become the univer
sal alphabet of mankind. Still greater
wonders were to follow than the estab
lishment of the electrical telegraph as a
means of communication between distant
points of land. In 1S43 Morse sugKested
the possibility of connecting Europe and
America by cable. The work of Cyrus
Field in accomplishing this stupendous
achievement Is" within the memory of most
of us. That first cable messaee between
the old world and the new will ring for
ever in the ears of mankindâ "Glory da to
God in the highest, and on earth peace
and pood will toward men." The most
Impious cynic of this century has been so
thrilled by the thousht of "human mes
sage flashing to and fro wherp the "sheH
burred cables crr<Â»p" that he has written:
Hush! Men talk to-day o'er the waste of the
ultimate slfmp.
And a new word runs between, whispering:
"Let us be one."
Without the cable and the telegTaph th<Â»
daily paper, such a marked feature of
modern life, would not be possible. Not
withstanding both telegraph and cable
tolls of necessity remained at a high rate
for a number of years, the press early
seized upon this wonderful means of
speedy communication.
For a time cable tolls between London
and New York were fixed at $1N> for a
message of twenty words or under, which
meant that no mossnee between England
and the United States could be sent for
less than $100. To-day an intelligible mes
rase may. by the use of code words, ta
passed between England and America at
a cost even tp Individuals not exceeding
75 cents. The newspaper rate is still loss,
and the news in detail ot operations in
foreipn countries is now an important
part of the daily paper. -It is interesting
to note that the first news dispatch from
Europe to a New York paper cost; Mono.
and it is further of interest thnt this first
dispatch from thf Old World consisted of
a political speech and the details of a
prize tight. ;

petition yesterday asking the Board of
Supervisors to pass an ordinance to revive
an old claim tor $102 4t for lumber fur
nished to the park lodge last March. It
is alleged that the Auditor refused to sign
the demand because it was not tiled with
in thirty <lay<* after the Park Commis
sioners had pansed upon it.
The Board of Public Works has fubmit
trd to the Supervisors plans and specifica
tions for an electric elevator in the main
corridor of the City Halt. The elevator ia
to be of the most approved pattern, the
grill work to be of oxidized copper, with
marble sides, and the interior to be fin
ished in maple.

Everything 'n America was in a primi
tive state. New York was as far from
Washington then in point of time as
Washington now is from San Francisco.
Communities had more of a distinctive
character than now, for they were less
often invaded by strangers, and when
these strangers came they were looked
upon with wonder, and their tales of other
lands, and even other cities not now re
mote, were listened to with surprise. The
character of men's thoughts and methods
of tloinjr business must, in an age not
equipped with time-saving conveniences,
have been necessarily slow. Men must
now do in an instant and by instinct, al
most. v.-hat in 1S00 they did only as the re
sult of long reflection.
Embassadors at foreign courts carried
on negotiations from one to six months
behind the progress of events at home, or,
when confronted by emergency, proceeded
without authority and trusted to their
Governments to ratify their acts. Had
there been cable communication between
Franco and America In 1S03 the anti-ex
pansionists of that day might have
thwarted the purchase of Louisiana. The
commissioners Jefferson sent to Paris
were authorized to offer $2,000,000 for an
outlet to the gulf. The First Consul daz
zled the envoys by offering them the whole
of Louisiana for 80,000,000 francs. They
were not empowered to make this pur
chase, and they could not communicate
with Washington, but with characteristic
American daring they closed the bargain
with the great Corsican. If the great At
lantic cable had then bound the continents
together that vast domain west of the
Mississippi, from which so many rich
States have been builded. would yet be a
French province, or, possibly, Indeed, an
other British empire.
W'Ken nations were at war armies at the
front continued to battle long after
statesmen at home or diplomats abroad
had signed conventions of peace. The
treaty of Ghent was concluded on Christ
mas eve, 1814, but forty-nine days were
to pass before the good news could reach
the American capital. In the meantime
the war continued, and Xew Year's day.
1S15, found Jackson's army knee deep in
the bayous of Mississippi, fighting the
triumphant battle of New Orleansâ a vic
tory that cleared a path for Jackson to
the White House. Then news that Madi
son had been chosen President did not
reach the- citizens in Kentucky until
three months after his election.

Wheat and Other Grains
WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris were both
weak. The decline at Liverpool was attributed
to the estimate of the Price Current that the
crop would run up to Â£50,000.000 bushels, which
was considered absurd at Chicago.
Chicago declined from S2%c to SO^ic, and
wheat was neglected for corn on complaints of
damage to the latter in Kansas. Nebraska and
Iowa, with continued hot and dry weather pre
dicted by the Weather Bureau. Another source
of weakness was the estimate of a crop of
125.C0O.00O bushels In the Northwest by Crop
Kxpert Ingles. .The demand for shipment was
speculative and very moderate. A member of
(he Board of Trade, however, who Is also a
large farmer, confirms the worst reports from
the Northwest after 2000 miles of travel. To
ward the close corn also weakened on realizing.
The local situation was weaker, with a de
cline of 2c on call.

CHICAGO, July 12. â Wheat opened wealc.
September lViÂ®l%o lower at SO^SiasC. In
different cables and the astonishing claim by
the Price Current that the Government figures
on the spring crop were ridiculously low caused
the change in sentiment. Longs became dis
couraged and began to unload. Under this
pressure the market continued on the down-
Krade until September reached JOTie. At this
point the decided strength in corn began to
be felt in the wheat pit and produced a more
confident feeling. P?veral phorts became ner
vous and commenced to cover, forcing the
price up steadily to flTfcc. The upturn met
generous proilt-taking and the market soon be
gan to rag again. Claims from the Northwest
of a decided Improvement to the spring crop
as a result of recent rains added to the sell
ing movement mid September declined grad
ually to SO'.ic. There was a feeble rally dur
ing the laft hour on indications of a large de
crease In the visible, but the advance was only
temporary and thÂ» market closed weak within
a fraction of the day's lowest, a decline of
2'tc below yesterday.
Reports of damage from drought and light
country acceptances strengthened corn. Sep
tember closed practically unchanged.
Oats ruled strong and active. The close was
unchanged for September.
Provisions were heavy throughout. Traders
sold lard and ribs owing to the weakness In
wheat. September pork closed at a decilne

THE STOCK MARKET.

NEW* YORK. July 12.â The phrase "petered
out" Lost expresses what happened to the up
ward movement of prices to-day. The action
of the ctexk trarljet was entirely aside from
any news of the day as was the case with
yesterday's sharp rise. In fact the news ct
the day for the most part was fa\-orat>le to
higher prices. The reaction must therefore be
attributed to purely technical causes. It teems
to demonstrate that yesterday's J'.imp in prices,
Â¦which Â«-8B primarily directeJ against the short
Interest, has resulted In eliminating the weak
portion of the uncovered shorts. Yesterday's
considerable rise invited heavy profit-taking to
day, bat after prices had fallen considerably
pressure from that source relaxed and an effort
was then made to renew the bull demonstra
tion of resterdmy. When Union Pacific got up
to 56 it b-c.-ime manifest that the orders to sell
u: that levc! were larger than the present bull
rnanascrs were prepared to absorb. That stock
then fell back and its heaviness was practically
unrelieved for the remainder of the day. The
Â«-fiV>rts of the bulls were then shifted to Balti
more and Ohio, which as a consequence was
rushed up 2*4 from tiie low point. Th's
mareuver proved unavailing to hold the mar
ket and tho latter part of the day showed
almost unrelieved stagnation. The offerings
were of a mere dribble, but even that could
not b*> slif-irlx-d by the feeble buying demand
end abuut all of the earlier gains were wiped
out. th** lev*! of prices penerally falling below
last nifht. The market Ignored completely the
crop rrrof'jx-cts as reflected in the grain market.
The money market in New York Is practically
lifeless r<> that un extra inducement would
probably draw gÂ«M from the New York banks.

Damage to the Yosemite Off
Barge OHlce.
There wp.s a collision off the barge of
fice last night between the British ship
Sir Robert Fernie, bound in, and the
Chilian bark Yosemite. lying at anchor in
the harbor. Fortunately the weather was
calm and not much damage was done.
The Yosemite had her jibboom and head
Â£"ar carried away and the bulwarks on
the port quarter of the British ship were
flove in.
The Sir Robert Fernie was sailing up
the bay on a light breeze. The night was
clear and. the water smooth. The breeze
died away suddenly as she was passing
the Yosr-mite and she swung around be
fore an anchor could be put down. For
tunately the vessels did not come together
heavily; but merely scraped. They were
towed apart by the tugs Redmond and
Alert.

sisting of \V. C. Billington, H. U. Jaudin

ing the reduction of the width of side
walks on Clement street from nineteen
feet to flftceen feet. On motion of J. B.

CAUSE OF PRUNE DROP.
Bulletin Issued by California Cured
Fruit Association.
Special IMsj'atch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. July 12.â The California
Cured Fruit Association, which was re
cently organized by the prune-growers of
the State to handle the dried prune crop,
to-day .Issued the following signed bul
letin in regard to the fruit crop at this
season:
We have carefully gathered reports from
members of this association during the pan
week concerning the effect of what Is known
as the "June drop" on growing fruit crop,
especially prunes. Our reports are especially
complete from this county (Santa Clara), which
furnlsheB three-fifth of the prune output of the
State, and convinces Uf that the severity of
the droi> Is unparalleled in recent years. Re
ports Indicate that the drop will reduce the out
put from 10 to 20 per cent from previous esti
mates. The drop seems to he more severe In
this county than in the State outside. In some
orchards nearly all the prunes are dropping
from the trees. The causes of the severe drop
are:
First, the hot spell that came Just at the
critical period; second, lack of moisture in the
EUbsoll aa a result of light rainfall for the
past few years.
Only a few orchards have escaped.
Prunes slightly affected by spring frost
remained on trees until the hot wave
came. The effect on peaches and apricots
has been to ripen them prematurely, thus
diminishing their weight and size. Apri
cots are also drying out heavily on trays.
This will lessen the total output con
siderably. The California Cured Fruit As
sociation controls nearly 90 per cent ol
the prune crop of the State.

YERBA BUENA LODGE IS
FORTY-SEVEN YEARS OLD
Room of Chinese Cook in Sutherland-
Looted and a Few Trinkets
Taken.
A daylight thief has been operating In
a fashionable hotel on Sutter street. A
report was made at the California street
police station last night that some time
yesterday one of the rooms in the Suth
erland was entered and a small amount
of booty pecured. Police officers were im
mediately detailed on the case, but as yet
they have no clew as to who the culprit
may be.
According to the guests of the hotel no
suspicious characters were seen to enter
or leave the building. The supposition is

Much Lighter. _j
PARIS, July 32.â The reduction in sala
ries announced by Commissioner Ferd W.
Peck does not affect all the employes of
the commission, but only those who re
ceived an increase of salary on their ar
rival in Paris. This increase has a hori
zontal reduction of 50 per cent, and comes
into effect August 1. This action. Mr.
Peck explains, is in accordance with the
circular of February 15 announcing the In
crease, in the following language:
"In consideration of the extra expense
entailed by living in Paris, your salary,
from March 1 and until not later than No
vember 1, will be at the rate of dol
lars per annum. I may find it necessary
to decrease this compensation at any time
during the above period if in my judgment
It/Is desirable owing to developments ot
tlft? situation.
/Mr. Peck tojday said that as the work
of the installation of exhibits was com
pleted and the arduous character of the
labor and demands on the time of the em
ployes was lessened It was only fair that
there be a corresponding reduction in com
pensation.
NO SMAXLPOX AT LODI.
Citizens Are Unable to Account for
FEIGNS INSANITY.
the Circulation of a False
Report. - Â¦ .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LODI, July 12.â There are a lot of angry
citizens in this town just now, and there
is every cause for their anger. In some
way not known to mortal mt-'l the re
port went abroad that small: x existed
in the ex-sporting center, and since then
inquiries have como in from outside places
and people regarding the truth of the ru
mor. Drummers on the road heard it
afar and made Inquiry before extending
their trip thus far; a county jollification
of Rathbone Sisters to be given here on
Saturday evening came near falling
through owing to the report of existent
smallpox in the watermelon center hav
ing reached Stockton. The Stockton
Ratlibones and Knights were on the qui
vive until they recfived word that tho re
port was utterly false. As a matter of
fact, Lodl has never had a case of small
pox in its existence: the town has not a
single case of sickness at present, nor
has it had for some time, and the ab
sence of illness of every sort is a subject
of comment among the physicians here.
How the smallpox fabrication ever came
into existence will probably never be'
known, but Lodi is angry and hurt that
such a falsehood should get abroad when
the town never presented a healthier ap
pearance than right now.
Organized Chicken Thieves.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LODI, July 12.â This town Is suffering:
from an organized gans of chicken thieves
and there are citizens laying for the bold,
bad thieves with shotguns loaded with
something worse than salt. In fact, some
bod v's anatomy will receive a wholesale
perforation one of these nights and hen
neries will be able to conduct themselves
without double padlocking the doors.
Chicken rnisint* Is done quite extensively
in Lodl and for some time past constant
raids have beon made on the biggest and
best henneries in town and among- the
suburbs. As a result the largest chicken
vards are almost 'depopulated and somo
raisers have sold their remaining stock
and given up in despair. -One Lodl an en
joyed the Fourth in Stockton and on re
turning the following day found that his
hennery had been robbed during the night
of all it. contained, amounting to several
dozen fine bred fowls. Â¦ This is only one
Instance out of many. "While there are
fcusplcions as to : the guilty parties yet
no direct evidence has been obtained,
though it is thought if the officers hustled
a bit they could lay hands on the thieves.

PECK EXPLAINS WHY
SALARIES ARE REDUCED
FRUIT MARKET POOL.
Low.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Prices Offered in the East Are Very
LODI. July 12.â Fruit growers In this
neighborhood are in poor spirits over the
market orrather the lack of market for
green fruit in the East. The growers of
this section are among the heaviest ship
pers of the State, and the low price ob
taining now has upset their calculations
owing to the fact that heavy crops pre
va "-. Owing: to the scare most of the
peaches will be sold to the Stockton can
nery, growers preferring to take a small
steady price for their entire output than
take chances with a glutted Eastern mar
ket. Selling to the cannery will do away
with a majority of the help used In for
mer seasons, as a few cutters and pack
ers in each orchard can handle all the
peaches which may be dried or sent East.
Apricots bore heavily, but the crop had
to be dried almost to a "cot," as the
"shotgun fungus." or scale, prevailed in
every orchard, whether sprayed or not,
to such an extent that the cannery peo
ple would handle only a very small per
centage of the crop. Apropos of the fruit
question, Lodl believes she is entitled to
the honor of shipping the first green fruit
cargo ever sent from the State to the
far north. Francis Le filer, a local or
chardlst, received a $200 check this week
from a friend at Cape Nome, requesting
the shipment of peaches to that amount.
As no refrigerator linea are running be
tween San Francisco and Nome, Mr. Leff
ler knew it would be ruinous to ship green
peaches, but determined to fill the order
by carefully selecting apples, pears and
plums. So the Nome man will receive his
fruit.

SAX JOSE, July 12.â The people of
Mountain View were awakened last night
at about' 10 o'clock by a terrific explosion
in Weilheimer & Sons' powder magazine,
which is situated about forty feet In the
rear of their store, aiid right in the center
of the little town. Windows were broken,
plaster cracked and the populace excitedly
turned out. The magazine, which con
tained two cases of giant powder, six
kegs of black powder, fifty gallons of gas
oline and fifty gallons of coal oil, was
wrecked, but, strange to say, onl'y one keg
of black powder exploded. No one was
near at the time or loss of life might have
resulted.
As soon as it was thought safe an In
vestigation was made. It showed some
one had forced the door of the magazine,
cut a hole In one of the powder kegs and
inserted a fuse and lighted it. It is a
mystery why the balance of the powder
did not explode. Had the other five kegs
of black powder and the two cases of
giant powder exploded buildings all
around would huve been wrecked and the
scattered oil and gasoline would have add
ed flames, which would surely have de
stroyed the town, as there is no means of
ngrhting flre at the place.
The force of the explosion was felt for
quite a distance. A barn close to the
magazine was wrecked, as was the roar of
Weilheimer & Sons' store. In the store
of Ropers & Rogers. 100 feet away, seven
windows were broken. Windows in Park
lnpon'R hardware store, across the street,
and in Johnson's drugstore. 300 feet from
the explosion, wero shattered, and nearly
every pane of glass in Constable J. D.
Martin's residence Buffered. Lesser dam
age was reported over the town.
It is believed the explosion was caused
by some <yie holding a snite against the
Weilheimers. Shortly after the explosion
a man was seen several blocks away run
ning In an opposite direction.
Sheriff Lnngford returnod from Moun
tain View this evening after making a
careful investigation of the explosion. He
in satisfied that it was the work of some
enemy of Wellhplmer. but no clew to the
perpetrator could be found. Constable J.
D. Martin with his bloodhounds Is follow
ing whnt 19 supposed to be the trail of the
man seen running away after the explo
sion. When Lanxford left Mountain View-
Martin had not returned.
Fortunately but One Keg of Powder
Exploded, but the Building
Was Wrecked and Win

PHILADELPHIA, July 12.-Judgs Mc-
Pherson in the United States District
Court to-day handed down a decision in
the case of a deserting Russian naval
surgeon which has an important bearing
on the sending by foreign nations to this
country of skeleton crev/s to man war
ships under construction in the United
States.
The case was that of Leon AlexandrofT,
an assistant surgeon, who was assigned,
with a staff officer and a crew of nf ty-four
sailors, io man the cruiser Varlag, which
is near completion at the Cramp ship
yards.
Habeas corpus proceedings for the re
lease of Alexandroff were brought two
weeks ago. Counsel for the prisoner at
that hearing contended that the treaty
between the United States and Russia,
merely* provided that in case a Russian
seaman deserted a Russian vessel while
In this country, he should be apprehended
and returned to the latter Government.
It-was also contended that the prisoner
was not guilty of such an offense, as the
crew of the Variag had never been organ
ized. Therefore, It was argued that Alex
nndroff might be a. deserter from the Rus
sian navy, but not from a Russian vessel.
It was maintained by the counsel for
the Russian Government that the treaty
provided for desertions from the navy as
well as Russian vessels.
Judge McPherson discharged the prison
er on the ground maintained by Alexan
droff's counsel. The Judge said he had
reached the decision with reluctance as
the prisoner was a deserter and he did
not regard his abandonment of duty with
favor.
Counsel for the Russian Government im
mediately took an appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals, and Alexandroff
was held In ball pending a decision of that
court.

Among other matters appertaining to
municipal Improvements the Market

"That we consider the people of this city
are entitled to the purest and freshest
water obtainable, and therefore we are op
nosed to the purchase of any system
wliich depends on storage reservoirs for
its maintenance."
The Board of Education in making pro
vision for only one vice principal in the
grammar schools Is certain to Involve
itself in a peck of trouble when it pro
ceeds to put the rule into effect. The trou
ble will In all probability assume the phasa
of a lawsuit on the part of six vice prin
cipals who will find themselves without
their positions ln schools where there are
at present two euch oflicia'.s.
The schools and vice principals which
will be affected by the ruling of the board
include the Adams Cosmopolitan, Miss K.
F. McColgan and L,. F. Shuck, vice prin
cipals of equal rank; Clement Grammar:
Aliss N McFarland. senior vice principal,
and' Miss Frances Lewis. Junior vice prin
cipal; Hamilton Grammar, Miss Ella J.
Morton, senior vice principal, and Miss
Ida R. Strauss, junior vice principal:
Hearst Grammar, Miss Â¦ A. .J.- Clark and
Miss N. O'Loughlen, vice principals of
equal rank; John Swett Grammar, Mrs.
C B. BlRelow and Selden Sturgess, vice
principals of equal rank; Pacific Heights
Grammar. Miss Augustine G. Robertson,
senior vice principal, and Miss J. A.
Michelson. junior vice principal.
Chairman Mark said yesterday that the
vice principals would be dropped on the
recommendation of the principals ot the
schools. In this manner it may happen
that the senlof vice principal will be de
posed In favor of the junior vice principal.
In any event the ousted vice principal will
have just cause for a suit at law. accord
ing to a decision of the Supreme Court
that a teacher cannot be degraded in rank
except for certain specific reasons. Even
should seniority of service be adhered to,
the vice principals who are dropped must
be carried on the roll at the salary re
ceived while holding the position.
Chairman Mark further stated that
places would be found for the deposed
vice principals, even should they be as
sirned as class teachers. This is also in
clear violation of the Supreme Court de
cision. It is highly probable that if places
of equal rank sre to be provided the vice
principals of the other fourteen grammar
' schools in this city may be in danger if
the readjustment is carried out on the se
niority of service plan. The specific point
on which ousted vice principals will fight
the ca?p In the courts is that a teacher
may not be deposed to be supplanted by
another. It Is understood that a teacher
who was recently removed in the consoli
dation of classes Is preparing papers to
test the right of the board to dismiss her
summarily. Inquiry failed to elicit the
name of the teacher who is about to bring
pult but it is certain that the board will
have a case on its hands similar to the so
called Kate Kennedy ca.se, in which a
teache- won against a former board for
being dismissed in the same manner as the
present board is effecting dismissals.

EDELMAN WROTH
AT THE MAYOR
/CHARLES BDELMAN, the member of the Democratic delegation to
(( Kansas City, who was grossly insulted by Mayor Phelan during a
V-^ caucus of the California delegation at the Coates HouseJuly 3, ar
rived home yesterday in company with Judge Magulre. They stopped
over at Lincoln, Nebr.. on the way and had an hour's interview wltn Wil
liam J. Bryan. . ,
"The report sent by Mr. Carlton to The Call concerning the Incident ta
which Mr. Phelan insulted my race was absolutely correct." said Mr. Eflel
man last night, "with the exception that instead of witnessing the oCen
slve gesture of Mr. Phelan in a mirror I was facing him when he made it.
My back was turned when he commenced to make the gesture and facial
grimaces for the amusement of a correspondent from this city. I was ad
dressing the chair and he had attempted to interrupt me, but I nad lnsustea
on continuing, which was parliamentary. AVhile his hands were still ralsea
and his face distorted by a grimace, I turned, by chance, and looked the
Mayor srjuarely in me face. He certainly looked abashed. There was no
mistaking the meaning of the gesture. I took it to be in ridicule of my race,
and naturally resented it.
" 'I demand respect, I command respect and I will enforce respect,' were
the words I used. , .Â» **. ?
"The thing was not done in the dark. There were eight witnesses to It tnat
I can name and who will vouch for it. They are: Ex-Senator Del \ alle of
Los Angeles. Mr. Farraher of Sisklyou. M. F. Tarpey. Frank Freeman.
Mr. Justro, Al McCabe and Al Murphy. I had agreed not to say anything
about this thing, but when I arrived here and found that Mr. Denman. wno
was present at the meeting only through the courtesy of the delegates, nad
made a statement denying the facts I felt that I had to set myself right. Mr.
Denman was sitting in such a position in the room that he could not possibly
have seen what occurred. His statement is absolutely false.
"Mayor Phelan has never attempted to deny thr- story- He has tried to
explain it by saying that his gesture was one of disgust, and that he meant
no insult, but I can vouch for the fact that none of the real witnesses took it
in that way. Mr. Justro sat next to Phelan and within two feet of him. Per
haps Phelan did not know that Justro is of my race, but he is, nevertheless,
and he was so angry over it that it was with difficulty that he was restrained
from making a personal assault on Phelan after the meeting was over. Mr.
Justro was the only other Jewish member of the delegation, all reports to tnÂ»
contrary notwithstanding.
"Phelan afterward accused me of treating him in a ruffianly manner.
The Call's correspondent asked Senator White, in my presence, whether I
had done so. Senator White replied that if I had he would have called me
to order. He remarked at that time that 1 had not mentioned any name
in my remarks.
"There seems to be no doubt of Phelan' s dislike for the Jewish people,
for he has displayed It on several occasions, despite the fact that 96 per cent
of them cast their votes for him at the time of his last election. He seems to
have some personal grudge against me. although I do not know what it la.
He tried to have me removed as chairman of the committee on transporta
tion, to which I had been appointed by Senator White.
"Phelan's exclusiveness during the whole trip estranged him somewhat
from the other members of the delegation. He did not turn out with the
Iroquois Club when we left, although he Is a member of that organization.
On the trip there were several incidents that caused the breach to widen
One day Mr. Justro remarked: 'This is the last time the so-called reformers
will ever carry the city of San Francisco. The people will turn them down
next time.'
" "The opposition is merely from a lot of whipper-snappers who could not
get places under me," was Phelan's sneering reply. I remarked that It was
In very bad taste for him to say so.
"Now I want no apology, nor will I accept any apology of any kind from
"Mr Phelan I will not ever again recognize him in any way nor will
I permit him to speak to me on any subject. I would like to think that the
insult he offered was for me personally, but I am convinced that he intended
to insult my race. You can mark July 3 as the date of his political death.
and Crlmmlns will put an anti-boss label
on the Mint saloon ticket In order to
diminish the danger of deception the Re
publican taxpayers In each district should
prepare In advance a list of the anti-boss
delegates to be voted for.
Republicans must keep In mind the pe
culiarities of the contest. In the Flttn
District the delegates elected to the State
convention at feanta Cruz will resolve

Democratic Clubs.
Democratic enrollment under the aus

Sarty began in this city last night The
committee provided each Assembly Dis
triTt Club with a set of officers before the
invitation to join the club was Issued.
There was not a large enrollment In the
official clubs last night. An impression
exists that the county committee repre
sents bubonic Phelanism. hence the Dem
ocrats are not tumbling over one another
to enroll. Several clubs are going ahead
with enrollment and organization without
reeard to the county committee.

SAY THEY WILL
NOT BUY THEIR
OWN STATIONERY
Fire and Health Boards Up
in. Arms Against Action
of Supervisors.
Acting Auditor Wells Says Resolu
tion Is Illegal According to
Charter and Appropriation
Insufficient.
It becomes apparent, therefore, that all
stationery must go through the hands of
the clerk, and that contracts in excess of
$24,400 shall not be entered into. The rea
son why the Health and Fire boards have
been selected to relieve the strain on the
insufficient appropriation is because the
sums of $158,400 and $12,4-10, respectively,
have been apportioned to the two depart
ments for expenses and extra employes.
The Fire Commissioners and members of
the Health Board will go before the Su
pervisors next Monday and object to pay
ing any money out of funds which they
claim they have other uses for. They
contend that they, are entitled to a por
tion of the stationery fund and if the
fund is too small that all the depart
ments of the city government should be
made to pay for stationery needed after
the fund has become exhausted, which Is
likely to occur in about nine months.
The clerk of the Supervisors shall have
rooms in the City Hall for the custody of such
stationery, and when purchased the same shall
be delivered to him, and he shall Issue and dis
tribute the same to the various departments as
required.
Under the head of "contracts," the
charter provides that the clerk of the Su
pervisors shall annually, under the direc
tion of the Supervisors, advertise for pro
posals for supplying the various depart
ment officers and offices of the city and
county with all stationery and supplies
In the> nature of stationery, assessment
books, minute books, blankbooks and the
printing of blanks. It says:
Acting Auditor "William Wells, In the
absence of his father, the Auditor, who
is on his vacation, says that the board
has no right to single out any depart
ment and force it to pay for its* own sta
tionery. He says there has been an ap
propriation of $24,400 for stationery for all
departments, and all are entitled to their
pro rata of the fund, it the appropria
tion is insufficient, and Wells thinks It is,
any excess expenditures for stationery
and printing supplies -will be illegal.
Resolved, That all demands for stationery,
books and printed blanks furnished the Board
of Fire Commissioners and the Board of Health
be presented to said departments for approval
and the same shall be charged to and paid out
of the appropriation set aside in the budget for
said departments.
The Board of Health and the Fire Com
missioners are up In arms against the
resolution recently passed by the Board
of Supervisors requiring them to pay for
their stationery and printing for this fis
cal year out of the funds appropriated
for their separate departments. The of
ficials in the Auditor's office will come to
their aid by raising the point that in the
passage of the resolution the Board of
Supervisors has clearly violated a specific
provision of the charter. The resolution
on the subject reads:

LEO MAURER is the proprietor of a
boarding house at 120G Market
street, and about a week ago he en
gaged George Okausi, a Japanese,
as a waiter. It was not long before he
was sorry that he had taken the Japanese
into his service, as there was a falling off
in the number of dishes and glasses.
Okausi was blamed for it. and Maurer de
termined to keep a watch upon him. He
was thunderstruck when he saw Okaust
juggling with two or three plates. He
would pitch them into the air one after
thÂ« other, catching them as they fell.
Sometimes he would miss his catch and
the plate was smashed to pieces on the
floor. He remonstrated with Okausi, who
told him that he had been a famous jug
gler and he. need not be alarmed because
a plate was broken. Maurer threatened
to discharge him and he promised to be
good.
Okausi did not keep his promise, and the
cook continued to complain to the "boss"
about broken dishes. Wednesday Maurer
could stand it no longer. He saw Okausi
juggling with a piece of ice and the ice
pitcher. Every moment he expected to
see the valuable pitcher broken to -pieces
on the floor. HÂ» was afraid to interrupt
Okausi, but when the performance was
over he called him into his office and
promptly discharged him. He retained
J2 50 from his week's wages for the broken
crockery and glassware. OkausI de
murred and grabbed hold of Maurer,
threatening to juggle him in the air. He
lifted him from his feet and dashed him
against the wall.
Maurer sent for a policeman and Ser
geant Wolfe called and placed Okausi un
der arrest on a charge of battery. When
searched at the City Prison a lottery
ticket was found in the pocket of the Jap,
and an additional charge was placed
against him on this account. The cases
were called In Judge Mogan's court yes
terday, and after hearing the evidence the
Judge reserved his decision till to-day.
Okausi will be convicted on the charge of
battery, but the charge of having lottery
tickets in his possession will be dismissed.
MR. OKAUSI HAD NO RESPECT FOR LANDLORD MAURIER OR HIS DISHES.

by Detective Thomas B. Gibson of the

where he was charged and where ho
passed the night. He will not only be
called upon to answer this accusation but
others, which District Attorney Bylnffton
declares will Inevitably follow from the
outrageous conspiracy which made of the
Probate Court of Judge Troutt a fleld for
illegitimate operations.
In this serious affair th<Â» personal in
tcrcrts of John M. Chretien have become
of secondary importance. The expose
made by The Ca!i has demonstrated to
the community that legal crimes are not
only possible in San Francisco, but have
actually occurred; and reputable lawyers
are unanimous in their determination to
punish the man and if possible his as
sociates fcr the crime which has cast a
reflection upon the entire fraternity. Aa
soon as practicable, therefore. Chretien
will be disbarred ar.d when he is called
upon to answer the charge of forgery of
which be is accused he will appear as a
dishonored lawyer.
Several conferences were held yesterday
by the police, the District Attorney luid
Judge Troutt. It appears that there is
some difficulty in characterizing the crime
of which Chretien has confessed himself
to be guilty. After much deliberation the
officials decided that it was best to accuse
Chretien of the crime of forgery in having
â¢witnessed a bogus document by which the
lictitious John Sullivan transferred to J.
J. Itauer the only real estate in the prop
erty of Joseph Sullivan, the dead tailor.
This property is worth no more than $200,
and it still is recorded in the name of Jo
ecph Sullivan, the dead man.
On May 5. 0112 day alter the decree of
distribution had been issued by Judge
Troutt. the bogus heir, who was then the
negro Robert Colthorp, transferred this
property to J. J. Kauer. the witness being
John M. Chretien. In scrutinizing the
various documents in the case the attor
neys discovered this legal transfer and
accepted it as the basis for prosecution.
Finding no encouragement in their ef
forts to prosecute the confessedly criminal
lawyer the authorities decided to take the
initiative themselves, and Detective
Thomas B. Gibson swore to the following

lie is confessedly a dishonorable attorney
who has committed a grievous crime. lie
has been charged with this offense and
ho must answer for it. He lias admitted
that in the probate court of Judge James
M. Troutt he presented a bogus heir, v.ho
v.as imposed upon the court and who re
ceived me award of the property which
did not belong to him. With Chretien
the public therefore nas no further con
cern, except u> see that he is punished
for what he has done.
Ju.ipe Troutt made a formal order yes
terday morning directing Sheriff Lack
ma:;!! to release Robert i.oltiiorp, the ne
gr<> servant and unfortunate tool of John

the dead. The order was sent to the
Countv Jail and Colthorp was forthwith

tlobert. } ou tole the truf ana nutting but
It, wliich was jes right."
The probate scandal, which the expose
of The Call precipitated, has aroused the
legal fraternity to a high pitch of indigna
tion and excitement. Wnile nothing has
been said to indicate that Judge Troutt
has been guilty of deliberate evil-doing,
attorneys ms:si that he has been grossly
partial "in the distribution of his official
favors to a few lawyers, particularly to
his ex-partner. Martin Stevens. The
records show that Judge Troutt has ap
pointed Stevens in scores of probate
cases. Stevens has reaped througn Judge
Troutt a rich harvest In representing the
State in its collateral inheritance inter
ests.
These facts have given occasion for con
siderable comment and some scandal in
the legal fraternity. They appear to
b-ar, however, no deeper significance than
that of favoritism, while the crime of
John M. Chretien and his fellow-con
spirators has provoked the deepest indig
nation of the people of the city and the
State, whose interests may at any time
be identical with those of the dead man
whose estate was confiscated by a bogus
heir. It is true that this estate will not
be lost because of tho schemes of Chretien
.ind his associate rascals. The fact re
mains, however, that the property of the
dead was bartered by these men even be
fore Judge Troutt awarded it to a man
who represented himself to be what he
was not and who was. as The Call has
shown, simply a tool in the hands of
scheming scoundrels.
EQUALIZERS PRY INTO
JAKE RAUER'S BOOKS
Pacific Gas Improvement Company j
Granted a Reduction â Spring 1
Valley's Modest Bequest.
For the first time on record, according \
to Assessor Dodge, J. J. Rauer. the
money loaner and bad hill collector, who
bought the Sullivan estate from John
M. Chretien, has had an arbitrary as
sessment of $50oO placed on his personal
property, and he appeared before the Su
pervisors, sitting as the Beard of Equal
ization, yesterday to explain the matter
away. To his apparent surprise, he found
the Assessor and board hostile, und would
have gracefully submitted to what he was
inclined to believe was "outrageous treat
ment" â rather than have an examination,
of course â had not Dr. Dodge suggested
that the board might raise his figures if
they saw fit. The board saw fit to order
Rauer to forthwith present to them the
statement of his personal property which
he had neglected to present to the Asses
sor, and to have it ready by Monday.
Although Itauer is generally supposed
to be worth $300,000, he pays taxes upon
but a small part of that sum, and he has
never made a statement of his personal
property, as required by law. His wife
makes a statement on household effects
and his clerk fixes the value of the per
sonal effects of the Rauer Collection
Agency regularly at $100, but nothing is
ever said of the vast sums of money that
Kauer is supposed to loan out at high
rates of interest. In order to find out
something about this Assessor Dodge
made an arbitrary assessment of $5000 and
cited Rauer to appear before the Board of
Kqualization.
The Assessor smiled his blandest smile
when Rauer appeared. The money lender
looked worried, probably because his
friends have been sending him gilded
bricks through the mails, by messengers
and in other wa*s, and he had. been busy
in keeping his buggy free from them.
"How often have you made statements
of your personal property to the Asses
sor?" queried the Assessor, after Jtauer
had been sworn.
"I really can't say," was the reply, "but
right straight along. I suppose."
"I've looked over the records for some
years back and I cannot find any of
ihem," rejoined the Assessor.
Then Kauer sought to explain, in mild
tones, with eyes on the table, lie gener
ally put all his money in real estate and
made returns on chattel mortgages that
were on record. He was in debt |9WO
when the assessment was made â -
"I wish the stenographer to take this
down " interrupted Chairman Braunhart.
"I5ut 1 am satisfied if the Assessor
thinks it is all right," continued the
money lender, humbly.
Dr Dodge tnen took a hand. I have
been unable to find any of these chattel
mortgages," he said. "I am sorry to say
that I fear the Assessor has not perform
-d hi? full duty In this matter. The board
has the right to raise this assessment if
"chairman Braunhart asked the clerk to
read the section from the that
covers such cares. He informed Rauer
that the board would require of him the
"tatement which he had failed to make at
the proper time to the Assessor and
warned him to be careful in making it out.
"I am willing to make out the state
ment," replied Rauer, "and leave it here

a<=s/Â»ssment of $1,120.0*) reduced about $C00.
(*ti He presented an elaborate table of
figures to show that 7245 shares of Central
Gaslight Company stock, included in the
assets of the Pacific Gas Improvement
Company, had been doubly assessed.
Assessor Dodge replied that he *iad al
readv discovered the mistake and reduced
the apposfiment $300,000 giving the com
pany all that was asked. He tried to have
Attorney Sutro agree to his figures, and
nnrlv every member of the board took
to 'pencil and paper. Attorney Sutro would
not be convinced, but asked to have the
matter postponed until this afternoon that
he might have more time to look Into the
Assessor's figures. The matter was so ar
ranged.
Attorney McEnerney appeared for the
Pacific Realty Company and asked that
the assessment of $1,000,003 on 33,000 shares
of Homestake Mining Company stock,
owned" by his client be canceled. ' lie
pointed out that both were California cor
porations, and he did not. consider it legal
for the stock to be assessed in that man
ner. He thought an assessment on the
franchise would be a better way of getting
at it.
"Would you consent to an assessment on
the franchise if the other assessment were
canceled without taking the matter into
the courts?" asked Assessor Dodge.
"I would," replied the attorney.
"Then I recommend the stock assess
ment be canceled und tlio company a_s-
FCFi-red $500,000 on its franchise," said
Dodge. "Is that satisfactory to you, Mr.
McEnernfy?" queried the chairman.
"Well, Id rather see it fixed at $250,000,"
was the frank reply.
The board voted to make the franchise
{500.000.
The Spring Valley Water Works peti
tioned the Board of Equalization yester
dav to reduce the assessment on Its fran
chise, which was fixed by Assessor Dodge
at J5.395.233. to $3,500,000. The corporation
represents that the value of the franchise
is represented by and included In the valu
ation of the material property, already as
eessed by the Assessor as real and per
sonal property.
