China has been presented to the United

satisfactory. It :1s said that his. appoint

engaged at the present moment," which Is
for the relief, of the Ministers In Peking,
and Count Â¦ Waldersee.- who. Is now m!Ger

that a corps not exceeding 20,000 will be

PRINCE TUAN HAS LEFT PEKING.
TIENTSIN, Aug. 2, via Chefu, Aug. 9. â The Boxers are in strong force ten miles to the
south of Tientsin. They are murdering, pillaging and committing atrocities. It is reported
that Prince Tuan has left Peking and joined General Sung in hisposition, twenty miles to
the northward, the Dowager Empress having issued an imperative command for the reoccupation
of Tientsin and Taku. This step shows a determination to stop the advance, but it may be Prince
Tuan's scheme to escape.
A native colonel who fought against the* Boxers and protected the Christians sixty miles
south of here has been dismissed by imperial order. It is reported that friendly Chinese are aiding
the^Peking residents with food and ammunition, and that a new party of progressionists is devel
oping in Peking. The gambling instincts of the Chinese' will lead many of them to cast their lot
with the foreigners.
Refugees are returning in a starving condition.

ADVANCE FORCE OF THE PEKING RELIEF
COLUMN HAS CAPTURED YANGTSUN
Commenting upon Washington's latest communication to the Chinese â¢ Government, the
Daily Chronicle describes it as "idyllic diplomacy," and it declares the Chinese attempts to get
the Ministers to leave Peking, as described by M. Pinchon, have convinced everybody except the
Washington officials that a steady application of force is the only argument Peking can under
stand.
The Commissioner of Customs at Shanghai has received a routine message from Sir Rob
ert Hart, Director General of Imperial Customs, showing that the latter is still conducting the
business of. imperial customsâ a rather curious change of affairs when taken in conjunction with
the words "happily still alive," which he included in the dispatch, which was dated Peking, July 27.
The editorials generally incline to view the progress toward Peking as splendid thus far, but
one which cannot be maintained at the present rapid rate, as the concentration of supplies and
the establishment of bases will cause inevitable delays.
Another dispatch to the same paper, dated Tientsin, August* 6, recounts a reconrioissance
that morning by the Japanese beyond Hsiku, the result beings that the enemy was developed in
strong force, well fortified, at Weiho. The Chinese were superior in numbers, and after facing
the fire of seven guns the Japanese retired to Hsiku with three killed and twenty-seven wounded,
but having captured 200 horses.
With the exception of these messages. General Chaftee's report is the only account pub
lished by the London morning papers telling of the capture of Yangtsun.
COST OF YANGTSUN'S CAPTURE.
LOXDOX, Aug. 10, 3:55 a.m. â In the capture of Yangtsun the losses of the allies, accord
ing to a dispatch to the Daily Express from Chefu, dated August 8. purporting to give an
account of that engagement, were 200, the majority being killed. "The allies marched on
Yangtsun," says this report, "at dawn on 1 Monday. The position was held by 15,000 Chinese well
entrenched to the east of the river. After four hours of heavy fighting the Chinese were driven
from tneir detense works. , - .
BY capturing Yangtsun on Monday, two days after the advance on Peking, the al
lied forces have taken a long step toward their goal, and Washington already, figures
that ten days more shall bring them to the walls of China's capital. In taking Yarig
tsun sixty Americans were killed or wounded, mostly in the Fourteenth Regiment, but General
Chaftee could furnish only the name of Lieutenant Lang of the Ninth Infantry. The total
loss was about 200 men. The allies' losses at Peitsang are now reported as 1130, of whom
Russia contributed 600.
Previous reports of the destruction of the French legation in Peking had led to a belief
that it had been abandoned, but news of Saturday's date received yesterday from the Austrian
Minister announced that although part had been blown up by mines, it was still sheltering not
only the French but the Austriaris, who had fled to it when their own headquarters were "de^
stroyed, and probably the Belgians. According to an undated message from a German offi
cial, which probably left Peking about the same time, the Boxers surround the legation,
which is thus cut off from the British legation.
M. Pichon, the French Minister, reports strong efforts of the Peking authorities to
induce the legationers to leave the city, and their steadfast refusal.
Though hot an ultimatum, the note of the United States Government to China, made
public yesterday, "demands" an immediate cessation of the hostile attacks on the legations,
and urges hearty co-operation with the allies.

Above all, Humbert will be revered as a Kin?
who was not only Kins but was alst, the
brother of all Italians. He 'was more especially
the brother of the unfortunate. He was always
the first to hasten to give succor wherever there
was danger or, disaster. All Italy remembers
to-day how he went among the people at the
timÂ« of.tHt floods in Northern Italy: how he
went fearlessly amons the falling walls at the
pcene of the earthquake at Casamlcciola; how,
contrary to the advice of his Ministers, he went
among the people stricken with cholera at Na
ples, actually working with his own hands In
assisting the nursÂ«s to care for the sick. .

King's life. Garibaldi,' the most rabid republi

ness of heart. : He pensioned the mother of the
man who attempted to kill him, and no one
knew of the pension until after her death.
When the news of the crime . reached San
Francisco Italians cried out In the . depths of
their sorrow, * l W'hy should they take so good a
man â a man who was so great a factor in the
unification of Italy, who stood always for the
liberty of his country?"
In 1SS2 when Garibaldi died Giovanni Bavlo

whole people has died with him." These word*

Landing Troops at Shanghai.
On Its Own Responsibility.
This action by the United States was
taken solely on its own responsibility
without consulting other powers as to the
advisability of the demand. The use of
the word demand In the note thoroughly
Indicates the urgency of the message. In
the technical parlance of diplomacy it
differs from an ultimatum, which usually
fixes a date or sets a time within which
there must be compliance, the failure of
compliance during the stated time being
a ground for war. While a demand Is
less specific as to time of compliance.' it
none the less asserts a Dosltive right
which the Government will enforce If the
right be not conceded. Owing to the dif
ficulty of communication with Peking, it
Is expected that some days must elapse
before an answer can be received, and
there is a disposition to grant all reasona
ble time for Its transmission.
Minister Wu worked assiduously on the
mrsfage during to-day, translating it first
from English to Chinese and then into
the cipher code of ChJna. Owing to the
gravity of the document, this work re
quired scrupulous exactness and time, but
it is probable thatthe message is by* this
time en its way to the Chinese Govern
ment.
We nre ai^o advised by the Fame dlfpatch
frrm Minister Conirrr that in his opinion for
the fcreUrn Minsters to leave Peking as pro
posed in thÂ« edict of Aupun 2 would be cer
tain death. In view of the fact that the
imperial troops are now Crinifupon the lega
tion*, and in view of the doubt expressed "by
the imperial Government in its edict of August
2 aÂ« to its power to restore order and secure
absolute safety in Peking, it Is evident that
this eprn-hension le well founded, for if your
Government cannot protect our Minister in Pe
king !t will presumptively be unable to protect
him upon a Journey from Peking to the coast.

the remains of the late King of
Italy. -which left Monza at 4:2S p.
m. yesterday, accompanied by the
Duke of Aosta. the Count of Turin
and the Duke of Oporto, arrived here at
6:30 a. m. to-day, immediately after that
hour ten non-commissioned officers of
cuirassiers carried the casket containing
the body- of the late King from th<?
funeral train to the large hall of the rail
road station, which had been transformed
into a chapel, hung with sable draperies
with gold ornamentation.
The first chaplain of the court, assisted
by a number of priests, pronounced the
absolution, and the cortege started for
the Pantheon, where rest the remains of
Humbert's father. King Victor Emman

The sun was showing through a haze,
but the weather was not hot. The im

station was entirely filled with people,
and as the casket was borne into the

and remained bareheaded while the pro
cession was In view.

During the inarch of the procession
several crushes occurred. Among those
present in the crowd on Via dei Ser

wounds and thirty others were bruised.
The crush was ct*ise-l by the shying of
an Alpine officer's horse, frightened by
the fail of a chair from a balcony. The
crowd lied in all directions, but as soon as
the cause of the panic was known calm
.was restored and the cortege proceeded. "
A categorical denial is given to the re

test against the municipal flag. The
crushes elsewhere were also caused by
unimportant Incidents':,.?' -
The procession marched in perfect or

the procession arrived at 9:15 a. m.,
formed a veritable flower bed of wreaths
and flowers there deposited.

Pantheon's Decorations.
The exterior decoration of the Pantheon
was very simple. Under the immense por
tico had been erected two -large altars
upon which burned alcohol lamps. On the
steps of the altars were ' placed the
wreaths of bronze and flowers for which a
place could not be found on the cata
falque. Under the central archr opposite
. the main doorway, a large Latin cross
was suspended from the arched roof,
while black drapings and cypress wreaths
surrounded the funeral inscription in the
Interior of the temple and produced an
effect as grand as it was impressive.
The catafalque, seven meters high, was
placed on a pedestal one meter high. On
this a number of wreaths were deposited.
The upper part was covered with lilac vel
vet trimmed with gold and ornamented
with palm?. There were placed the
wreaths of the princes and other high per
sonages. Over the catafalque was erected
a gorgeous canopy with an iron cupola
supported by sixteen artistic, slender col
umns. In the cupola were 100 lighted
lamps, and around the catafalque were
forty-eight wax tapers suspended by ar
tistic chains.
When the casket reached the" Pantheon
the non-commissioned officers of cuiras
siers lifted it from the gun carriage and
carried it into the church, v/here it was
received by Monslgnor the Count of Reg
gio. Archbishop of Genoa, who was in. his
pontifical robes and surrounded by the
cathedral functionaries. The casket was
then raised to the top of a catafalque sur
mounted by the "Iron Crown." and on it
were placed the helmet and sword of King

Touching Scene.
THE PANTHEON, ROME, WHERE KING HUMBERT'S BODY
RESTS. /
The Pantheon Is a magnificent building erected at Rome by Agrippa about
25 B. C, and dedicated by himself as a temple of all the gods because of its
beauty. . For nearly thirteen centuries it has "served as a Christian church,
having been dedicated by Boniface IV about 697 to the Virgin Mary and all
the martyrs. It is now known as Santa Maria della Rotondo, from its cir
cular plan. Its external diameter is 1SS feet, and it is covered by a hemis
pherical dome 142 feet 6 inches in span, the entire height being about 141 feet.
It is lighted by a circular orifice 26 feet in diameter at the summit of the
dome. It has in frint a noble octastyle portico of Corinthian columns 103 feet
wide. But two persons have been before buried In the Pantheon, one of them
being Raphael, the artist, and the other King Victor Emmanuel, father of
Kins Humbert.

PRETORIA PLOT
TO MAKE LORD
"BOBS" PRISONER
LONDON. Aug. lO.-The Dally News
publishes the following dispatch from its
correspondent:
PRETORIA, Aug. 9.-A plot to shoot all
the British officers In this town and -to
take Lord Roberts prisoner has most op
portunely been discovered. Ten of the
leaders in the plot have been arrested and
are now in jail. This Is probably a part
of the conspiracy of which the attempted
rising at Johannesburg was the first indi
cation.
Everything was prepared in the plot to
make Lord Roberts a prUorcr and qhool
the British officers and the conspiracy
was only discovered at the last moment.
The conspirators numbered about fifteen.
They had planned to set fire to the houses
in the extreme western part of the city,
hoping that the troops would be concen
trated there. The plan was that then the
conspirators were forcibly to enter the
houses occupied by British officers, thess
having been previously marked, and kill
the occupants. All the Boer sympathizers
were acquainted with the plot and sev
eral had been told off to secure the per
son of Lord Roberts and to hurry, nim
to the nearest commando, Horses bad
been obtained for this purpose. Then the
British learned the names of the ring
leaders, who were put under arrest. The
affair has created a tremendous sensa
tion.
The following report, dated Pretoria.
August 8, has been received from Lord
Roberts:
Kitchener was informed yesterday by an es
caped British prisoner that Dewet'a wagons
had crossed the Vaal. Afterward I beard the
sound of guns which, I think, must have Veen
Methuen's, as I directed him to take up a po
sition between Potchefstrooxn and Llndlque,
where he could intercept the enemy, who cross

jority of whom are now en route for Care
Town. Three guns and 4000 horses were cap
tured and ten wagon loads of ammunition and
135,000 rounds of ammunition were destroyed.
The garrison of Elands River, which I fear
has been captured, consisted of about 300 bush
men and Rhodeslans. I had hoped that Car
rington had been in time to withdraw the ear
rison. but It seems that Delarey, learning of
Ian Hamilton's approach to Rustenburg, har
ried westward ar.d surrounded the garrison be

BKRLJX. Aug. Â».â The Foreign Office,
referring to-day to the presence of the
Boer representatives and of Dr. Leyds in/
Berlin, said that the delegation was hero
in an unofficial capacity only, and that It
was not likely that any power would, en
deavor to secure favoraole peace terms
for the Boers in the final settlement. Dr.
Leyds and the delegation, however, had a
conference this morning with Herr von
Dorenthal, privy councilor, who Is repre

sence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs
on his vacation.
Later in the day Mr. Fischer of the
delegation said to the correspondent of
the Associated Press In the presence of
Dr. Leyds: "The burghers or the South
African republic don't Intend to give up

thi3 privilege several days ago. He said
that at present Japanese were going
through across the boundary line from
British Columbia in snite of the officers.
They were stopped often, but they sim
ply waited around for a better chance and
a few days later they would be found far
south of the boundary line. Permission
was also . asked and will probably be
granted later for a change in the arrange
ments Â¦ for deportation.
Mr. Healy says in order to make the ar
rangement effective the Japanese should
be made to understand that they must re
spect the law, and with the small force of
twenty-five men this could not be done
unless they were armed. Â¦
Mr. Healy's proposition is to round up at
once all the Japs who have wrongfully
entered, confine them temporarily in the
nearest jail and then deport them ta
Japan. It is probable in this connection
that arrangements will be made by the
Dominion and Provincial governments to
render whatever assistance is necessary.

"Whitney and I went out from the

Rattlesnako Creek, which empties into
Eel River. We followed It to its mouth,
\*here we discovered going down Eel
River the tracks of two men. We fol
lowed the tracks about 150 yards and
were alarmed by a noise between us and
the creek bottom. We were at that time
en the bluff. On going to the edge of the
bluff and looking over we discovered the
fugitives rushing up together and pick
ing up their guns. We at once com
manded them to surrender, when they ran.
jumping over the creek bank. We fired
twice at them as they ran. We raided
their camp, securing two blankets, a
knife, two six-shooters, a coffee pot and
a sack of dried venison. This camp was
about 45 miles northeast of Covelo. We
examined the tracks of the fleeing men
carefully and found that they differed
greatly, one of them being made by a
email heel, boot, the heel projecting under
the foot; the other was a little larger,
having a square toe and a round, flat
heel. "We followed the tracks for several
miles and could not locate their horses
and became assured that they had aban
doned their horses several days ago
"After the fleeing men shifted their
course into the heavy timber tracking
was impossible and we were forced to
withdraw and save our horses from ex
haustion." *
Deputy Sheriff Redwine is endeavoring
to secure bloodhounds and fresh horses
and trailers for another expedition.

MISS BRAUNERSREUTHER, ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHOSE ENGAGE
MENT COMES FROM MANILA.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 9.â Some of the
creditors of Scott McXeown, whose finan
cial troubles were precipitated yesterday
by an attachment levied on his new house
at 2316 Flgueroa street, learn with sur
prise that his bride, who was Miss Dor
othy Studebaker, is not a mem
ber of the wealthy Studebaker
family of wagon-making fame. To a
creditor, who yesterday said he expected
Mrs. McKeown's family to come to the
rescue of her embarrassed young hus
band, another creditor, who had been
posted, said: "Why, she hasn't a bean.
She is only a very distant relative of the
rich Studebakers. If we get anything
from anybody's family it must come from
the McKeowns."
The announcement In The Call yester
day that the creditors of young Mr. Mc-
Keown were clamorous for a matter of
$35,003 and had closed town upon his vis
ible assets, was a surprise even to those
persons who knew that he had squandered
In two years a patrimony of $400,000 and
was going a pace at a rate of $150 or $200
a day. It was supposed that the young
married man, who is barely over 22 years
old, had not only unlimited resources "from
his father's family, but had also married
a big fortune.
The separate claims now being pressed
aggregate somewhere between $25,000 and
$40,000. All claims are unsecured except
the one protected by a mechanics' lien on
the Figueroa-ptreet house, a $11,000 mort
gage on the Redondo pumping plant and
one for $5342 on the Patagonia mine. A
few of the creditors evidenced a great de
sire to get their money at once. Others
appeared willing to wait upon their "kid"
debtor, as they call him.
Little was accomplished by the confer
ence and no promises of family assistance
were made by E. Blakely. who represents
the mother of young McKeown. To-day
it was stated by Mr. McKeown that the
young man will be able to pay out. It
may take six months' time to do It and It
?l'i I LÂ« requlre an expenditure of $10,000 to
Jlo.000 to protect certain of his invest
ments. The creditors will meet again to
discuss the situation.

McKEOWN'S WIFE
NOT AN HEIRESS,
AS WAS SUPPOSED
FRESNO, Aug. 9.â A complaint was
fled before Justice of the Peace Tucker
::iis morning charging Fred and Frankie
-limes and Elmer Martin with murder.
They are formally accused of administer
ing: poison to William Himes and thereby
causing his death. Justice Tucker in
structed Sheriff Collins to have the boys
in court at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon,
when they will be informed of their rights
under the law and have the date of their
preliminary examination eet.
Frankie Himes, the 9-year-o!d brother
of the leader in the plot, was the only one
of the boys brought into court to-day. The
little fellow was neatly dressed and sat
in the lap of his aunt, Mrs. William Hart,
Â¦while the court decided what to do with
him pending to-morrow's proceedings.
Mrs. Hart and her husband pleaded lor
the tot and promised to have him In court
at the appointed hour if the Justice a4
lowed him to go home with them Instead
of sending him to the County Jail. Tucker
finally relented and permitted the aunt
and uncle to take the boy for the night.
He intimated, however, that the lad would
have to go to jail to-morrow and remain
in prison until a higher court determined
his fate.
Frankie repeats that his father never
mistreated him. On the contrary he de
clares that Himes was fond of all the
children and so proud cf them that he
vised to invite the neighbors in of an even
ing to hear them sing and recite pieces
they had memorized in school.
"\Yhy, then, did you help poison your
father?" was one of the questions asked
the boy to-day after he had told of his
father's kindness to him. "Well," said
he. "Fred thought of it first and I told
him I didn't want to kill father, but he
kept talking to me, and after a while I
fcaid I guessed it would be a good plan."
The remarkable thins abeut the boy Is
the way he kept the secret of Fred's plot-
He knew about it bofore Elmer Martin,
a much older boy than himself, but Mar
tin was the first to get frightened and con
fess. In fact, when Fred was arrested
ho exclaimed, "That Martin boy
pouea.!ed. I know Frank wouldn't." The
ctticers say that if Martin had not re
vealed the plot the cause of Himes' death
never would have been known.
There is some difference of opinion as to
the' ape of Elmer Martin, which may be
an important question when the time
comes for deriding upon his punishment.
"When he v.as lirst brought tfi jail the
Deputy District Attorney asked him how
old he was and he replied that he would
bo 14 nojet Admission day. This Â¦would
mako him as o!d as Fred Himes or a llt
t!e older and Â¦would have aa Important
bcttxlas on the question of his responsi
bility for the crime. He Is fully as large
.-ip the eld^r Himep boy and more husky,
but not quite so quick wltted. His a*re
vass first piven as 30 years, but It is evi
dent that he Is considerably older. In the
opinion of thA District Attorney there is
little doubt that all three of the boys will
pl<^ad R-uIIty to murder in the first degree.
This, he says, will leave the court to do
ride whether or not they knew of the
v. ronpf ulness of the crime when they ad
ministered thft poison. If they are held
recount able they must be sent to tKe
ponixentiary for life; if not, they cannot
hr punished at all.
The body of the father was to-day ship
ped to relatives at Capltola for burial.

THIRD DISTRICT CONGRESSMAN, WHO CONFOUNDS HIS

In Dignified Address He Shows Enquirer's Incon
sistency and the Danger to Republican
Party in Fight Against Him.
OAKLAND. Aug. S.-Victor H. Mel
calf, candidate for Congress, to
r.ight. for the first time, replied to
the attacks that have been made
upon him during this campaign. Mr. Met
calf In making his nght has entirely er
frained from personal attack, but to-night
the Oongrffsman appeared ! before the
Quarter Century Republican Club and de
nounced the course pursued by the En
quirer. He declared positively that that
B*r<-r was owned by Dr. George C Pardee
mnd Batty P. Dalton, who is opposing him
for Congress, and that thej were using its
columrs to attack him personally. He
quoted editorials to show that in 1S9S, at
the time that the primary frauds, charged
by the Enquirer, were supposed to have
occurred, ar.d while the Enquirer was
owned by Dr. Pardee and Mr. Dalton. the
paper not only had not cried fraud, but
had supported him. He declared that the
Enquirer, by Its preset; t course, was
jenpaidizing the chances of elwting a Re
publican Congressman in this district
wh*Â»n one of that political faith was nec
essary to support the administration. His
statement was emphatic, but did not
saver in the slightest degree of personal
attack. It was as follows:

;2 r ?J, a \ w , My action was called last night
to an editorial in this paper, and I desire
to read a portion of it to you for the pur
poM of showing the way in which this
t S i i s , conducted by their side. It is
readed 'Honest in the Primaries.' and this
Is what it says:
'". "J wo - v t ars asr> Mr - Metcalf was nomi
nated a*: the result of a primary that put
to blush the vilrpt elections that were
over held in this State. Stuffing, repeat
ing, fraudulent methods, bribery and all
that goes to ca-st discredit upon American
citizenship and American institutions
were freely and openly indulged in. Some
*??, c S rt ' ncates wer e used to thwart the
will of the honest, respectable voters, and
the most unblushing frauds were com
mitted. The result of that primary was
the nomination of Mr. Metcalf for Con
gress.'
"If that was the case, why did not the
Enquirer two years ago, when it was
owned by the same men, come out and
denounce that primary instead of waiting
until one of the owners and proprietors
is a candidate against me for Congress?
"Let me read lo you this little editorial
from the Enquirer of August, 188S:
" 'The Republican candidate for Con
press from Alameda County is a gentle
man who has had a good preparation so
far as unofficial life can give it. for legis
lative office. He Is a graduate of Yale
I nivcrpity and a lawyer of experience and
ability. In this Republican district a
nomination is practically equivalent to an
flection, and when Mr. Metcalf goes to
Corpress we hope he will make a useful
member, ar.d that, if he does so. he will
be continued in service long enough to be
come really valuable to hi? district. His
friends who put him forward for the of
fice must not expect him to climb to the
tÂ«p of the lad<J>-r at the first session.
Fuch a thing is impossible, for graduation
is tho rule of Congressional life. In that
body a man must be content to advance
to *tatirtn and to influence slowly, and hi3
constituents must learn not to "be impa
tient. If he were a HlaJre or a Reed, Mr.
Metcalf could not accomplish in his first
term half the things which enthusiastic
friends have promised upon his behalf '
"If what the Enquirer said In the edi
torial "of last night was true it was the
duty of the Enquirer to have denounced
these, frauds at the time it says they oc
curredâat the time this last editorial was
writtenâ and not wait until one of the
proprietors of that paper is a candidate
for Congress and then try to use It purely
and Firr.ply as a campaign document and
Instrument.
"Now. taking up the statement of Mr.
Jordan headed 'How the nomination was
Ftolen from S. G. Hilborn.' Then in large
print, 'Those men that asked me to do
this work were William E. Dargie, Victor
II. Metcalf, Emll Nusbaumer and others '
I will say that I do not. at this time,
gentlemen, like to refer to my own
troubles, but for three weeks before that
primary election I was at the bedside cf
my mother, expecting her to die at any
moment, and she died *n the Sth of Au
gust and. I did not put in an appearance
in Oakland until about four days before
the primary. My friends, knowing tho
circumstances, came to my assistance
tr>ok charge of my fight, and it was en
tirely due. to their efforts that I was suc
cessful in obtaining that nomination. I
never saw Mr. Jordan. I never had a
word to Ray to him regarding certificates,
and I knew no more about certificates
being Issued than a babe unborn Ai:
that I knew was that Mr. Jordan came lo
my office two or three days before that
primary and called my attention to what
he said were untrue attacks madÂ« upon
him by the other side. He had never
taken nny part In my light, had never ex
pressed a desire or willingness to assist
me in any way. but when the attacks
came from the other side he then took
a part in my campaign. When I called
Mr. Jordan's attention this morning to
the statement which I have Jush read h<Â»
said. 'I made a mistake. I want to be
perfectly fair and I am perfectly willing
to correct it.'
"Now what did Mr. Hilborn say. If
VICTOR H. METCALF REPLIES
VIGOROUSLY TO TRADUCERS
. In the light of the record quoted the
committee appointed to govern the party
cannot expect that the independent Re
publicans of San Francisco will take or
ders from Martin Kelly.
Bosses who make a - profession of poli
tics and derive their profits from divi
dends from the slum entertain the fancy
that the nineteen thousand loyal Repub
licans who supported Horace Davis last
year will llne#up under the leadership of
Martin Kelly this year. In this respect
Dibble, Lynch and several county com
mitteemen .are making false calculations.
The elean. : Independent Republicans of
San Francisco will vote for McKlnley ami
Roosevelt and against boodling candidates
for, the Legislature. *
It is true that the Republican bosses,
headed by Martin Kelly and Phil Crim
mins, entered Into a conspiracy with Sam
Ralney and the Democratic bosses to de
feat Sir. Davis and elect James D. Phelan.
The conspirators scored, a triumph with
the aid of bolting Republicans. The same
kind of a triumph was scored when Kelly
and Crimmins betrayed and defeated
Estee. the regular Republican nominee
for Governor.
One year ago the independent and en
lightened Republicans arose in their might
and drove the political bosses from the
Held. They elected a majority of dele
gates to the nominating convention and
placed that able and fearless Republican,
Horace Davis, at the head of their ticket
The nineteen thousand Republicans who
voted for Horace Davis in 1S99 are as firm
ly opposed to boss rule now as they were
one year ago.
The Republican party is composed main
ly of intelligent and independent men.
The voters of the party, for the sake of
organization, will take advice from le
gitimate sources of party authority, but
they cannot be driven to the polls and
compelled to vote for boodlers and place
hunters.
The plan of intervention adopted at
Golden Gate Hall last week provides that
If a county committee falls to call an
election before August 15 the members of
the State Committee, representing the
county, shall order such election.
The right of the State Central Commit
tee to Intervene may be questioned, even
if the county organization falls to come
to a conclusion within the time specified.
The fact is significant that the State Con
vention which created the present Re
publican State Central Committee did not
derive Its authority from delegates elect
ed by the people at a primary election. It
is common knowledge that many of the
delegates, if not a majority of the whole
number, were appointed by County or
Congressional district committees. A
fountain cannot rise higher than It3
soifrce.
The Republican County Committee will
meet in executive session to-morrow night
and make another effort to adopt a plan
for holding a 'Primary election to choose
delegates to the State and local conven
tions. If plans be not adopted on or be
fore August 15 the State Central Commit
tee may intervene.

A FAIR and open primary is what
the well-meaning Democrats of
San Francisco want, if the meet-
Ing held in Pythian Templo last
evening Is to be taken as an expression
of sentiment. Kach of eighteen Demo
cratic clubs representing Assembly dis
tricts in the city and county of San Fran
cisco was represented by one or more del
egates, and the feeling to a man was
against the County Committee for Its at
tempt to dictate as to who shall have the
right to vote at the coming primary. A
sweeping resolution was passed, denounc
ing the County Committee, and requesting
certain concessions, and a committee of
seven representative Democrats was ap
pointed to appear before the State Com
mittee Saturday and present the docu
ment.
The meeting was called to order by At
torney" John Heenan. president of the
Thirty-first Assembly District, and he was
made temporary chairman, with William
Battersby secretary. A roll of delegates
j was then called, and it was found that all
of the eighteen districts were represented,
although representatives of one or two
Â¦ said they had not been officially delegated
by their respective clubs. They, however,
had no doubt that their organizations
were in full sympathy with the move
ment
Chairman Heenan said that the tendency
of the times was toward centralization of
power. There were indications of it right
in San Francisco, and he hoped the Dem
ocrats would guard against being mis
guided by the promoters of this new ele
ment. Every Democrat In San Francisco,
he said, Should etrlve for harmony and
not Imperil the success of the national
party by factional differences.
Timothy Treacy of the Forty-third at
tacked the County Committee without
gloves. He said there would be no trou
ble electing the Democratic nominees in
his district If the voters were given a fair
opportunity; if, on the other hand, the
County Committee attempted to dictate,
then the voters would become lukewarm
and the ticket, in all probability, would
be defeated. He warned the Democrats
that it would not be wise for them to try
omnibuses in which to take part in the
parade..' The parlor will have headquar
ters in the Native Sons' Hall:
General ClunlÂ© made a short speech In
which he scored the* County Committee
and declared that to attempt to wrench
away the right of a Democrat to vote fo.
whom he chose was an outrage and such
methods would do more than any
thing else to break down the party. Oth" r
speeches were made by James Ford Clituj
Barbour and Mr. Fltzsimmons.
A resolution was also passed providing
for a committee of eighteen, one member
from each district, which member shall
have power to appoint five members from
his district and these shall constitute a
permanent organization. As soon as the-i.>
appointments are mada a meeting will b-j

George Gallagher or the Thlrty-eJghth
Introduced the principal resolution of the
evening and after its reading he added
these spicy sentiments: "We needn't
mince matters when we say that the
Democrats have lost entire confidence In

Bryan and our fundamental object Is to

It shall appoint the election officers, so

"Our grand State can Justly be proud of the fact, that It has the finest dis
play In agriculture, mining, pomology, art, social economy, fisheries, dried fruit,
etc., and in addition to this our headquarters are visited by thousands, includ
ing not only the people from the Pacific Coast, but by the general public.
"There has been a great deal of discussion and 111 feeling in connection with
the wine exhibit that was uncalled for. The jury proposed at first to throw out
all wines that bore French names, but after considering the matter further they
decided to pass upon our products not only as to quality but type. This places us
on the Eolid footing we desired, and I am assured that we will gain a number of
greatly coveted prizes, among whlch^wlll doubtless be some made of the yellow
metal. The complaints as to the installation of the California exhibits, particu
larly the wines, are not warranted, for the reason that the management of the ex
position had the matter of arrangement In hand and mad^ the style of all ex
hibitions uniform. We could not interfere with the arrangements, but It was fair
to all, and California has no cause to bemoan its treatment in any respect. We
had eo much to show that we became very prominent.
"More than one-half of the space devoted to the United States for the display
of mining products was taken up by the California exhibits. We had 140 wine
displays, 200D photos of vineyards and wine cellars: v;e also displayed mineral
waters and besr, and gave away 30.000 Illustrated souvenirs, as well as highly in
structive reaps. As a result of our exhibition of wines and brandies one of tho
largest distillers of France proposes to come to this country and establish three
distilleries, each of which will employ a large numbc-r of men. The Institution
now owns twenty-ono distilleries In France, but sees a great opportunity In this
country. The wine men of California will certainly feel ilattered at the favorabla
comment that has been made on the quality of the products of their vineyards.
"My personal business affairs callerl rne home at thl3 time, but It is possible
I may go back to the exposition In September. Commissioner Foote will doubt-,
less remain until the close of the big show, and he may have the company of the
other Commissioners."
Commissioner Kunyon is enjoying excellent health, notwithstanding the fact
that the .weather in Paris was anything but healthful. In concluding his inter
view he stated that the celebration of tha Fourth of July in the heart of tho
French metropolis was one cf the marvels of the international occasion.

â¢jp^vANSY HAGGETT, the flighty
Vf~J) young woman, who declared she
IT married Conductor Frank Law
rence "in fun," la now inclined to
look more seriously upon her union with
the man with the punch. To-day she will
pray the court to have the petition for the
annulment of the marriage set aside, and
that done she will proceed to make Frank
Lawrence a true and faithful wife.
For a while, however. Pansy wants to
rtay home with "mamma" and gradually
eccustom herself to the fact that she is !
Frank's wife. Then when she considers
the has learned to love the conductor
â¢with all her might there is to be a gen- |
<ral rejoicing in the Haggett liat and
l'ansy is to move to the home Frank will |
]>rovide for her. That Js the way she has i :
j/lanned It. I .
Last evening when little Pansy told of s
]i*r change of heart she admitted that she i
had known all along that the San Rafael j
rnarrisge was a bona fide one. Outside j :
Influences, she explained, in the form cf ! i
T. J. Kennedy, first cornet of the Pcnsa- j I
cola, was brought to bear upon her flex- j I
ible little heart, and acting under that in- i
fiuence she consulted a tirm of lawyers ; '.
to have her wedding set aside.
"I kr.ew all along that I was married ] "
fast and good," said Pansy as she told
all the romantic details of her marriage,
"but when 1 bepan to think It over I was
rather afraid I did not love Frank enough.
I told Kennedy about it and he advised
me to consult Kimbal & Klmbal. I had
noticed that on the marriage license my
name was spelled 'Ilackett' Instead of
â¢Haggett,' and 1 askod the attorney if
that made my marriage to Lawrence il
legal. He said no, and then I said I
wanted It to be illegal. And that was all
there was to it."
According to the story Pansy tells now,
it was the maid that wooed the man. "We
had been engaged on and off," said
Pansy. "On July 11 Mr. and Mrs. Hay
wards and Frank and 1 went over to San
Rafael. As I was passing the Courthouse
I said to Frank. 'Let's get married.' 'Do
you mean It?' said Frank. 'Yes,' said I.
And then he went in and Rot the license
and we went to a clergyman's house and
were married."
In Mrs. Hapgett Lawrence is going to
find a model mother-in-law. She warmly
espoused his cause, and it is owing not a
little to her influence that Pansy is about
to try to learn to love him.
As for Cornetist Kennedy. Mrs. Hacpett
has not one gocd word for him. ""He
wanted to ruin Pansy's life," she said.
"He's no good." y
LORD RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN.
LONDON, Aug. 10. â Baron Russell of Kiilowen of England died
this morning. Baron Ru-oell had been ill for some time. Yesterday
an operation was performed which the patient is reported to have
passed through in good condition. This operation, however, resulted
in his death.
It was performed by D . Plezes. Various reports have been cir
culated as to the disorder irom which the Lord Chief Justice suffered.
According to some his malady was a gastric disorder while others
say he had tumor of the stomach.
Lord Russell was conceded to possess one of the greatest legal
minds of the day. By sheer force of character he won his way to the
top of the profession. He was born in Ireland 67 years ago.

In the treasury for the payment of such

The Western Improvement Club will
take up the fight against the redistrlctinK
plan adopted by the School Board. A
meeting will be held In the Flood building
to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock to form

club will do will be to petition the Super
visors to rescind their action and if this
does not accomplish the desired end zaors
emphatic measures may bo adopted by
the society.
That the residents of the "Western Ad
dition are thoroughly wrought up la evi
dent from the dally complaints made to
the school authorities by the parents of
the pupils affected. In the Grant ami
Pacific Heights school3 no less than 1200
scholars are inconvenienced.
According to the parent of ona of the
pupils there are eighty children In one
of the sixth grades of the Pacific Helgrhu
School, to which some of the Grant chil
dren 1 ' were transferred, with only fifty-flvo
seats to accommodate them. Virtually
two scholars to a seat. When wilting it
Is necessary for part of the class to stand.
In another room there are seventy-eight
pupils and the third sixth grade ia this
building 13 nearly as bad."
There are now three vacant rooms in
the Grant School and because of the new
arrangement a large number of pupils
who formerly went to the Grant School
now have to go from/eight to fourteen
blocks to get to the Pacific Height
School. /
An order ha3 been issued by th* Board
of Education that the scholars of certain
grades must attend the Girls" High School

ear fares mean to him an additional ex
pense of $72 a year on a basis of 60 cents
a week for each child, excluding the tea

they select a few buildings and then try

MASS-MEETING
TO DISCUSS THE
SCHOOL PROBLEM
THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
S~^ ONGRATULATIONS are due to the Mer
l chants' Association upon the record of its
Work, which appears in the fourth anniversary
number of the Merchants' Association Review. The
organization has been one of great usefulness not
only to its members but to the whole city, and it is
gratifying to learn it is rapidly increasing in numbers
and in strength, and will be in the future even more
than in. the past a potent force in urging on the ad
vancement of the city.
Commenting upon the growth of the organization
the Review says: "The most sanguine among the
forty-seven charter members of the Merchants' Asso
ciation six years ago could have scarcely imagined
that the membership would ever reach one thousand.
Yet to-day there are 1226 firms enrolled as active
members of the Merchants' Association, making it
numerically the largest commercial organization in
the world. During the existence of the Review our
membership has. nearly trebled. This remarkably
rapid increase of members affords gratifying proof
that the association's work enjoys the confidence and
support of this community. Strength of numbers is
an irresistible weapon in popular government."
Along with the increasing power of the association
there has gone a steadfast expansion of the field of its
operations. At the present 'time it has committees
engaged in investigating practical questions pertain
ing to the cleaning, sprinkling, paving . and light
ing of the public streets; the removal of poles and
wires from the main thoroughfares; the establishment
of children's public playgrounds; the arrangement
of uniform and attractive signs indicating names of
streets; the construction of public conveniences; the
utilization of salt water; better harbor facilities and
lower port charges; the conservation of the /flood
waters of the State; the Pacific Commercial Museum;
the correct administration of charity and numerous
other important topics and desirable improvements.
Of such an association it pays to be a member.
There are many ; advantages of a personal ' nature to
be derived from it, for its co-operative energies are
directed largely to the benefit of its members; but
the highest good of such' membership is to be asso-
If the professors and doctors in the University of
California clinic indulge in much more of the secre
tiveness which they displayed in reference to the
woman who die"d on their operating table it w r ould
be wise for their superiors to open a bureau of infor
mation in connection with the establishment.
THE RANGE WflR.
SIN'CE our recent summary of the season's war
fare on the stock ranges, held free 'to all on the
public domain, other returns have come to
hand.
George Belcher, a New Mexico cattle man, while
riding his range on the public domain was shot from
ambush by Mexican bheepherders and dangerously
wounded in the thigh. The cowboys who were with
him opened fire and the battle Jasted until dark.
The cattle men in ILoutt County, Colorado, in
driving sheep off the range, clubbed 1500 to death,
uiing wagon-spokes as weapons, and Mr. Johnson
reports that they arelarmed and prepared to protect
their range by force.
As a result of war between sheep and cattle men in
Urowns Park and Ashley Valley, Mr. Rash, a cattle
man of Ladore, Colo., was assassinated at his ranch,
snd his cowboys have armed and taken to the war
path to avenge his death.
At Telluride, Colo., cowboys warned sheep and
goat herders to keep quiet and proceeded to kill two
hundred sheep and goats and stampeded as many
more over a cliff, killing them all. Then the shoot
ing began and lasted all night, with several in each
party wounded. In Beaver Park there is trouble
over 3000 theep, and the cattle men has started in tp
kill them all.
It is pleasant to read a more peaceful report from
the Big Horn range in Wyoming, where Mr. McCar
thy reports a lull in the war between sheep men and
says that there has been no shooting for a whole
week, and the wounded are in a way to recover.
From Chamberlain, South Dakota, come rumors of
war against the sheep. It is free, public range, but
the cattle men claim superior rights by reason of prior
occupancy. They see with alarm the invasion of the
range by sheep and its destruction by their close
feeding, and have the sheepherders to with
draw their flocks. The herders, after getting the
third notice to leave, supplied themselves with arms
Â£nd ammunition, asserting their rights to the free
range, while the cattle men announce that they will
shoot them on sight.
While the forage that is left on the ranges is being
lield by the murder of men and the slaughter of ani
mals, the ultimate effect of the present System is fol
lowing. The National Stockman and Farmer says
that the recent distress on the Southwestern
ranges is the natural result of overfeeding and destruc
tion of the means of the water supply. The forest re
serves, the natural sources of water, have been de
stroyed, the plains pastures have been overstocked
and exhausted, and now, cattle are being
driven away or lost by thousands, because the range
privilege has been abused. The system which makes
it necessary for every man to get all he can from the
range without regard to its future usefulness is radi
cally wrong and mu-t end in disaster to those_/\vho
dtpend on these pastures. The Stockman and Farmer
might have added that it means also disaster to the
country's meat food supply of the most serious na
ture, abridging the supply for domestic use and cut
ting off a valuable and important export trade.
There is only one remedy, and that is the leasing of
the ranges, and bringing them under lawful control.
Do not forget in these days that the Admission
day celebration is one of the patriotic things to which
you ought to contribute and' contribute promptly.
The Chinaman lacks a good deal of being as good
a fighter as the Boer, but all the same he has shown
something like the same ability to get up* a surprise
party.
According to all reports from the Orient it appears
that as soon as we have helped the Russians civilize
the Chinese we shall then have to help the Chinese,
get in and civilize the Russians.
Another subtle attack has been made upon his
Honor the Mayor. The Supervisors are considering
an ordinance which is designed to regulate and limit
the granting of special privileges under the charter.
The twelve-year-old Montana girl whose pleading
saved her father from imprisonment for life will be
*ome day an interesting young lady, whose requests,
it is safe to say, will be granted without protest.

SECRETIVE OFFICIALS.
pUjOR the second time within a comparatively
I brief period the Sacramento Bee has been com
pelled to resort to the courts in order to obtain
from State officials documents of importance to the
public and of interest as news. On each occasion the
decision of the court has been in favor of the Bee, so
there can be no dispute but what the action of the
officials was an illegal assumption of power and an
attempt to conceal from the people matters of which
the people have a right to a full knowledge.
The latest of the two instances is of particular in
terest to San Francisco, because the State paper to
which the Bee desir2d access relates to the bubonic
plague scare. On August 2 the Bee requested of Dr.
Matthews, secretary of the State Board of Health,
permission to see the reports made upon the alleged
plague by Drs. Mouser and Ryfkogel, in order that
it might make such publication of them as it saw fit.
The request was refused, ami thereupon the Bee sued
out an alternative writ of mandate before Judge Hart
of the Superior Court, and the mandate was issued.
In overruling a demurrer of the defendant Judge
Hart said: "I have no doubt that the reports, of
which inspection is herein demanded, are public
writings within the meaning of sections 1892 and 1893
of the Code of Civil Procedure, and of which, accord
ing to those sections, every citizen has a right to have
inspection, or take a copy, or obtain a certified copy."
Commenting upon the decision the Bee very justly
says: "The secreting of public documents, which the
statutes give the people a right to examine, away
from the humblest citizen of the land is an arrogant
and aristocratic assumption of despotic power which
should never be permitted."
The Call has had experience with the growing as
sumptions of officials in this respect both at Sacra
mento and in this cit} r . Not long ago a representa
tive of The Call at Sacramento was refused permis
sion to see the correspondence which passed between
Governor Gage and Attorney General Ford concern
ing the proposed amendments affecting the judicial
department of the State. In this city it has had fre-/
quent occasion to comment upon the secrecy with
which various boards and commissions of the muni
cipal government are carrying on the work of ad
ministration. Instead of holding public meetings for
the discussion of all public business intrusted to them,
so that their plans, projects and policies can be made
known to the people, the officials meet in executive
session, everything is kept as secret as possible, and
the people are left in ignorance of matters, of which
they have a right to a full knowledge.
Such tendencies on the part of officials are radically
bad, and unless checked Will inevitably lead to gross
wrongs and to jobbery. It is true that an action is
not necessarily bad simply because done in secrecy, nor
necessarily good simply because done publicly; never
theless, all the world knows that honesty does not
hide itself and that dishonesty will hide if it can. Our
laws wisely provide for publicity in all branches and
departments of government, because nothing else can
so surely guarantee the rights of the people. There
fore every attempt on the part of an official to keep
secret a matter of public business is an assumption
that should not be tolerated or excused.
The Bee has rendered important service not only tc
the press but to the whole, State in making the fight
against secrecy of the officials at Sacramento, and it
is to be hoped that' having now for the second time
demonstrated the right of the public to know what
the State officials are doing, it will not have to resort
for a third time to get a mandate from the courts to
compel the officials to obey the law.
Once more Philadelphia rises to protest against
being called a slow town, and by way of backing the
protest points to the fact that her factories have built
the swiftest locomotives on land and the swiftest ships
on the sea; but she ignores the vital point that she
sells those ships and engines and lets other folks run
them.
Chicago is complaining of "blind pigs" in the
parks, but for once it is not a pork question.
The blind pig is a place where a Chicago citizen can
get a drink without the police knowing anything'
about it, and the reason it is complained of in the
parks is that the girls are on to it.
The police officer who pleads that his head was
troubling him when he assaulted and would have
killed his superior may discover that the Police Com
mission has a peculiar way of removing troublesome
thingsâ even heads.
C. A. Towne, who has declined the nomination of
the Populists for-Vice President, has scored a triumph
in English rhetoric. He consumed hundreds of very
Â¦valuable words to disguise the single reason he had
for his withdrawal. He did not say he was disgusted.
Bryan's oratory is to run in a different groove this
year from what it did in 1896, but it will be the same
old stuftV
Chicago must be suffering from strange apathy.
The national census has been taken and we have heard
nothing to suggest that the city Â¦ of the lakes is the
largest in the world.
Since Senator Wellington of Maryland has come
out squarely for Bryan it-is safe. to predict that his
Waterloo is not going to turn-out as the original
one did for the other Wellington! ;
The Boxers have probably discovered that they no
more than others. possess the ability to dodge bul
lets. The Mongol savages had an idea that foreign
bullets bounced when they struck.
Li Hung Chang may be old enough to deserve the
tespect which attaches to age, but the interesting old

A recent review of the building and loan associa

power to pay off the savings at fifty cents on the
dollar.

of the Review opens: "Every citizen interested in
the material welfare of San Francisco ought to co
operate actively with this organization. There are

BRYAN ACCEPTS.
THE first of Colonel Bryan's three acceptances of
the Presidential .nomination has passed, with all
the incidents of crowds, cheers and enthusiasm.
His speech, which was read from manuscript, and
copies of which had been placed in advance by the
Associated Press with the newspapers, is devoted to
one subject, m the main, and makes but a brief ex
cursion into other topics.
In his introduction is the sole reference to finance.
It is in the form of a vague but venomous attack on
the Republican party, in these words: "The Repub
lican party is dominated by those influences which
constantly tend to elevate pecuniary considerations
and ignore human rights. Man, the handiwork of
God. is first; money, the handiwork of man, is of'in
ferior importance. Man is the master, money the
servant; but upon all important questions to-day Re
publican legislation tends to make money the master
and man the servant."
Let us briefly examine these declarations. Mr.
Bryan served two terms in Congress. He was in a
House composed of his own party, with a majority
so large that the Republicans and Populists could
have walked out and still left a constitutional quorum.
What legislation did he propose and what did his party
pass and make the law, for either man or money?
The Republican legislation of which he complains was
on the statute-books. Did he propose its repeal?
Did his party substitute anything for it? . The sole
attempt it made was in the Wilson bill, distorted out
of the shape in which its author framed it, and when
passed denounced by President Cleveland as "a rec
ord of shame, corruption and dishonor." Surely in
that period, when Mr. Brayn was in Congress and in
a position to shape legislation, man was not dodging
his master, the dollar, but, in want, famine, starva
tion and suffering, was out hunting for the dollar and
not finding it. Mills were closed, banks were crash
ing, all wage-paying enterprises were suspended.
Cities '.verc running soup-houses and the roads were
crowded with thousands of men organized in armies
and crying for bread. The dollar was not bothering
man in those days. The Republican party was not in
power, the dollar was not in circulation. Man was
in that glorious state of independence which Colonel
Bryan regards as his ideal condition, and labor was
too poor to buy drugs for its sick or to bury its dead.
Remember that this was when Bryan was a legisla
tive officer of the Government, with actual power to
influence its policy toward man and money.
But he 'and his passed out of power. The last year
of their rule Mr. Bryan's estate, given under his oath
to the Assessor for taxation, was only worth $240. The
first year of Republican rule it had risen to more than
five times that value, and now, by his own oath, is
more than twenty times the value it had in 1896. Is
he still master, or does his estate, multiplied by
twenty, master him? During the time of this increase
he has not followed any regular calling, and has aban
doned his two vocations of law and journalism, yet
he has prospered in basket and in store, and his petty
estate, when the country/was run on his plan, has
grown to be plutocratic under Republican policy.
Will he say which was master, man or money, when
the Coxey army, the Kelly army and the other ragged
regiments were marching on Washington? Where
are those armies now? Does he know of a soup
house that is open? Does he know of a poorhouse
that is filled with American mechanics? In the day
of his influence, when he was in Congress, "man, the
handiwork of God." was shivering and starving, in
rags and hunger. He was driven to choose between
stealing and starvation. He was striving to the death
with his fellow-man tor a chance at the poor wages
that were to be earned.
Now, because the Republican party has changed all
this, because the shops and mills are running, trade is
active, prosperity is reinstated, and labor earns good
wages and capital good profits, he faces an audience
to impeach Republicanism for putting the dollar
above the man!
The Republican party has not put the dollar above
the man, but it has put good trousers on man, with
pockets, and has filled the pockets with dollars.
Let every laboring man who heard or reads Colonel
Bryan's speech recall his position in 1896 and contrast
it with his position now, and ask himself if he desires
to go back.
That prosperity which multiplied Colonel Bryan's
own estate by twenty has reached and touched ; every
man in the Union. It has been general and not par
tial. The country likes it and will not throw it away
to gratify the fetid ambition of Colonel Bryan.

WRECK "OF THE PFLUfiER. \ :The Sacramento directors have promul
gated two or three changes ln the rules
to govern the sport there. In selling
events, only owners having an entry in
the race are entitled to bid on the winner.
In addition, before taking advantage of
this privilege the rule compels the horse
man intending to bid to deposit with the
judges a sum equivalent to the entered
selling price of the winner. This la to do
away with "grudge" and "scrub" bidding,
and looks an extremely wise measure.
Anent rulings, Indefinite suspensions will
not be recognitcd, only those ruled
off for fraud being excluded from partici
pating in the racing. No pooling of issues
or forming of combination will be toler
ated from the bookmaklng fraternity. If
a satisfactory amount cannot be realized
from layers of odds willing to cut In, the
directors have decided to handle the auc
tion and parls mutuel betting themselves,
charging the usual 5 pÂ«r cent commis
sion, In addition to putting on two field
books. An offer of $20,000 made by an
Eastern man for the privilege', to be con
ducted on the same lines as last year, was
received and refused.
The appended list will show the vast In
crease in number of entries to running
stakes over the preceding two yearB*.
It can be said without fear of contra
diction that the annual race meet to bo
held during the fair at Sacramento, next
month will be the greatest in -the history
of tho State* Agricultural Society. As
sistant Secretary Harry Lo-wden came
down from the capital city yesterday, and
among other things said that already
there was a dearth of stable room. Ap
plications had been received for stalls for
453 runners â a most remarkable showing.
Harry said he guessed the Emeryville
and Ingleside trainers, with requests ln
for 120 stalls, would have to take pot luck.
The harness events also loom ,,up most
promisingly, 178 trotters and pacers in all
being entered. This boom In up-country
racing speaks volumes for the energy and
push displayed by Secretary Peter Shields
and the directors of the society.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 9. â Those fel
lows who think I am a "has been"
will change their opinion after my
bout with Ruhlln. My hands are
Just as serviceable as they ever
were, and my strength and hitting
powers remain unchanged.
ROBERT FITZSIMMONS.
NEW YORK. Aug. 9.âFitzsim
mons is a cunning fellow in the
ring, but he will have to. spring
something mighty original to lead
me Into a trap that will give him
an opportunity to score a knock
out. I think I will win and believe
I will do the trick Inside of fifteen
rounds. AUGUST RUHLIN.
NEW YORK. Aug. 9.â Comparatively
few wagers have been placed on the flght
which Is to take place ln Madison Square
Gardens to-morrow night between "Bob"
Fitzsimmons and "Gus" Ruhlln. Of the
few wagers placed odds of 10 to 8 were
laid that Fitzsimmons would win. Those
who pin their faith to Fitzsimmons be
lieve that his experience, original tactics
and great generalship, together with his
hard hitting, will more than offset Ruh
lin's advantage ln weight and youth.
Several good judges who watched Fitz
simmons critically while at his work ex
pressed the opinion that the former
heavyweight champion was a bit drawn.
They thought he had trained down too
fine. .
Ruhlln's friends can find no flaw In the
physical condition of the "Akron giant."
"Don't worry about me being nervous,"
Ruhlln said, "because there will be no
occasion for It. My timidity, which was
so apparent ln my contest with Sharkey,
was due to the fact that I had been beat
en by Sharkey on a chance blow and a
desire on my part to prevent the sailor
from repeating the trick."
Fitzsimmons' friends point out that
"Lanky Bob" has a greater variety of
trick blows than any other living pugilist,
and they believe that he has several new
ones that will give him the victory. It was
Fitzsimmons who Introduced the solar
plexus blow, which proved so effective In
his fight with Corbett. It Is also pointed
out by the former heavy-weight cham
pion's admirers that their favorite can
strike a much harder blow than Ruhlln.
That Ruhlin is not a very hard hitter
they insist was proven In his fight with
Sharkey. The "Akron giant" hit the
sailor repeatedly on the head, and al
though he eventually knocked him Into
a state of helplessness. It took him a very
long time to accomplish the task. On
the other hand, Fitzsimmons has always
knocked his men out with a single blow
on head or body.
Rtihlin's supporters say that their con
fidence in the "Akron Giant" is due to
the latler's wonderful Improvement with
in the last six months. In their opinion
the Ohio man la just as clever as any
big pugilist ln the ring to-day. That he
is clover with his hands and as well with
his feet, they Insist was clearly demon
strated In his fight with Sharkey. In that
contest he showed ability to fight a bat
tle on the lines marked out for him weeks
before the event took place.
They admit he was a bit nervous ln the
flrst round, but his timidity quickly wore
away, and after that period Ruhlln had
things all his own way. They also be
lieve that youth and strength will tell
In the Ohio man's favor and will event
ually give him a victory. Opinions of
experts on the battle are interesting:
"Terry" McGovernâ Fitzsimmons la my
choice. V
Corbettâ T think Ruhlin will win.
"Al" Smith â Ruhlln Is too clever axid
shifty for Fitzsimmons to knock out.
Sam Harrisâ I am betting on Fitzsim
mons.
John Considlneâ I expect to see the
"Akron Giant" win and I'm betting my
money on him.
"Eddie" Burkeâ I'd llke^ to place a few
thousand dollars at 8 to 10 on Ruhlln.
"Tom" Sharkeyâ I pick Fitzsimmons to
win.
"Tom" O'Rourkeâ Fitzsimmons knows
too much for Ruhlln and I think he will
win. V.
John Ij. Sullivanâ I believe Fitzsimmons
will whip Ruhlln to-morrow night. The
bout will not go over six rounds.
M'PARTLAND'S* SECONDS

George McFadden of New York
Whips the Kid in Sixteen
Fierce Rounds.
NEW* YORK. Aug. 9.â At the Broadway
Athletic Club to-night Georgo McFadden
of this city whipped Kid McPartland. an
other local pugilist, so badly that Mc-
Partland's seconds threw up the sp6ngo
in tho sixteenth round to prevent their
man from being knocked out. I
Up to the tenth round McFadden suc
ceeded ln landing some fearful right-hand
smashes over McPar Hand's kidneys, and
these so weakened tho Kid that he went
to the floor In. the tenth round, and took
tho count before he got up. At the dose
of tho fifteenth round McFadden swung
left and right to the body and repeated
both blows to the head, sending: McPart
land again to the floor just as the bell
sounded. McPartland was groggy as- he
came up for the sixteenth round and'Mc-
Fadden rushed him. flooring him with a
body ' blow. McPartland was very weak
when he regained his feet and he clinched
to nave 'himself 'from going down again.
McFadden beat him off , and would un
doubtedly have knocked out McPartland
had the , latter's seconds not thrown up
the sponge. 'i&EBKBR&VtBBtBBtimBBR

her position on the card called for a go

see as many Eastern horses and turfmen

and the study of crystalline forms and
crystallography began to establish itself
as an independent science. Almost all of
the experimental results obtained were
discovered with reference to the possibil
ity of determining the relative weights
of the atoms of the elements. Two op
posing schools arose, one maintaining that
the accurate understanding of these small
quantities would be forever an impossi
bility; the other that a Judicious com
bination of laboratory results with theo
retical reasoning ultimately would lead
to definite conclusions. The latter view
finally triumphed.
Until l!?:Â» a sharp division existed be
tween so-called inorganic chemistry ami
that portion of the science termed or
ganic. Ihe substances with which organic
chemistry had to deal were supposed to
be the product of life action only; it was
neiievrd that any attempts at laboratory
formation of the products of living organ
isms would fail. In ISIS Wohler with one
stroke broke down the barrier. He suc
ceeded in synthesizing urea, which had
been considered solely the result of physi
ological action. The result opened a new
field for chemical activity and in a few
years many men were engaged in investi
gations which led to the production of a
large number of new substances and their
derivatives, all containing the elements
carbon combined with hydrogen, many of
them also with oxygen, nitrogen and phos
phorus and sulphur. The possibilities of
this new branch of the science, still
termed from habit organic chemistry,
were practically unlimited, but the old
controversy In regard to atomic weights
was not settled. Its development was re
tarded owing to the misunderstanding of
chemical principles. In 1S32 Llebig and
\\ ohler Published a long research on tho
oil of bitter almonds which did much to
clear up existing misconceptions, and a
few years later the French chemists, Du
mas. Laurent and Gerhardt. made a fur
ther advance by the discovery of chlori
nated acetic acid and allied bodies. The
conception of the nature of organic sub
stances and of the mission of this branch
of chemistry became clearer. In the early
?J3Ki Kekule in Bonn and Frautland anil
VV illiamaon in England finally brought or

on a theoretical basis, which has been fol

lems closely allied to chemistry and the
elucidation of questions appertaining to
solution will Inevitably have a wide prac
tical bearing. The Influence of physical
chemistry already Is being felt ln many
branches of technical Industry.
The strides taken by the chemical In
dustries, based upon the exhaustive the
oretical knowledge obtained by years of
laboratory development, have been mar
velous. Within the limits of this brief
article it Is not possible to enumerate the
smallest proportion of their progress.
Apart from the subjects mentioned above,
modern chemistry has revolutionized the
manufacture of explosives, glass, soap,
paper, alloys and cement. Metallurgy is
on an entirely different footing, and the
process of electro-metallurgy has become
one of the most Important industries In
existence. Beet-sugar production has
been developed almost Into an exact
science, and the various processes of fer
mentation and alcohol preparation have
kept pace with the rest.
Physiological chemistry recently has ad
vanced to a point where accurate results
and close reasoning are possible, and th*
benefits derived from surh substances as
antitoxin cannot be overestimated.
The entire army of chemical investiga
tors is moving forward to-day as it has
been in the past. The future for the
chemical Industries is perhaps beyond our
present comprehension, but in order for
this result to be accomplished the founda
tion' of technical advance must be laid
broad and deep in the firm ground of
scientific research. PAUL C. FREER.

final round â William* Larned defeated
George L. Wrenn Jr., 6-2, 6-2; Richard
Stevens defeated R. D. Wrenn, 2-6, 6-1, 6-4.
In the afternoon the semi-final round of
the championship doubles was started.
The opening match was between the Pa
cific Coast champions, the Hardy broth
ers, and Ollio Campbell, paired with Rob
ert Huntington. The two veterans set out
at a hot pace and forced the Callfornians
to run for the swift drives that they sent
deep into their court. The initial set went
to Campbell and Huntlnrfton by an easy
score, but the Hardys took the second set
at 6-2 and the third set at 6-1.

ENOS GILLERAN'S
BODY RECOVERED
Widow of Dead Man and Five-Year-
Old Daughter in Destitute
Condition.
The body of the man found in the bay
last Thursday morning was Identified at
the Morgue yesterday by David McWhlr-
ter of 457 Valencia street as that of Enos
Gllleran of 123 West Mission street. Olll
eran and his son George, aged Â» years;
Otto Macowski and David McWhirter
went sailing on the bay on July 29 In a
catboat belonging to McWhlrter. W hen
off Lime Point the boat nearly upset In
a squall and Gllleran and his son were
thrown into the water and swept away
by the strong tide and drowned. McWhlr
ter and Macowski succeeded In clinging to
the boat until rescued.
The boy's body has not yet been recov
ered Gllleran was 45 years old and a
native of Texas. He was a carpenter and
his widow is in a destitute condition with
a little daughter five years old to take
care of.
At the inquest held yesterday afternoon
by Justice of the Pence Barry, McWhlr
ter told how he and Macowski succeeded
In getting Gllleran and the boy aboard
the boat after they had fallen overboard.
The boy was a'.most drowned and imme
diately fell back Into the water. Gilleran
went overboard for the purpose of saving
him. and the last that was seen of them
was when the boy placed his arms around
his father's neck and said: "Father, take
me home."
Then they sank together.

At the beginning of the eighteenth cen
tury chemistry had just been emancipat
ed from the influence of medieval super
stition and had established its right to be
considered an Independent science, with
the consciousness of a basis for future
individual development. Almost from the
Christian era It was stunted by the ignis
fatuus of alchemy and latro chemistry.
Its sole reason for existence being the ap
plication of the few known facts to the
conversion of the baser metals into gold
or to the exploitation of so-called medi
cinal remedies. The knowledge thus far
collected was incidental to these purposes
and the prevalent theories were borrowed
from the Ancients or Arabians. AH
known Bubstances were supposed to be
formed by varying proportions of the
essential principlesâ earth, water, fire, air,
mercury, sulphur and salt. Experimental
science, having for Its object the estab
lishment of fundamental theories, derived
by the correlation of observed facts, was
unknown.
Chemistry as an Independent science
owes Its origin to Robert Boyle, who In
thÂ© middle of the seventeenth, century
was the first to courageously oppose the
older doctrines advocated by the peripa
tetics, and who. by a series of masterly
writings, sought to replace the vague no
tion of principles by more definite chem
ical elements, defined by him as sub
stances which could not by ordinary
means be disintegrated into two or more
simpler bodies. It is true Boyle frequent
ly erred In his conclusions, as. for ex
ample, when he considered glass and
water to be chemical elements, owing to
his Inability to decompose them. Al
though his methods were often weak, his
conclusions were sound, and his brilliant
experimental genius finally succeeded In
establishing the science on a firm basis,
even rendering the "black art" fashionable
at court; kings and princes neglected or
dinary affairs of state in order to dabble
with the "spring of the air" and kindred
Although^ Boyle revolutionized methods.
it was not until the beginning of the
eighteenth century that the entire scien
tific world abandoned the older views and
the way was opened for the establishment
of the first chemical theory which under
took to connect a series of obviously re
lated facts. Until this necessary advance
was made no substantial progress could
be noted, for all the efforts of Investiga
tion ended merely in aimless wanderings.
This first scientific step opened the *<&
for consistent and vigorous advance. The
first theory was subsequently discarded
because it was founded upon qualitative
and not quantitative observation of
chemical phenomena, nevertheless Its
benefit was incalculable, for it outlined a
definite and precise course for future ex
perimentation. The theory Is known as
that of phlogiston. Its object was to ex
plain the changes taking place .during
combustion. All matter while burning
was believed to separate a princip.e
termed phlogiston, so that the remainin?
incinerated product was suPP 05 /** JÂ°, be ,,2f
simpler composition than the initial sub-
St The e " fault of the theory was that In
reality bodies during burning gain in
weight, a separation seeming, therefore,
less than a union. A further develop
ment of eighty years was requiredJ^Xore
workers in the science realized this fact.
The phlogiston period was one of great
activity in the chemical field and many
notable discoveries occurred under its
auspices. Particularly was this true oÂ£
the isolation of various gases such as
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide (laughing
ca<0 nitric oxide, ammonia gas, muriatic
acid 'gas. chlorine and lastly oxygen and
hydrogen. Black. Priestly. Scheule,
Watt. Cavendish and many other men
added luster to the science. Considerable
progress was made in chemical industry:
the manufacture of fulphuric acid de
veloped and toward the end Â»t the cen
tury when the phlogiston theory was al
ready giving way to our modern views thÂ«
dry distillation of bituminous coal and the
manufacture of Illuminating gas, coke and
period was brought to an
end about 17S0-90 by the accurate re
searches of the Frenchman Lavoisier.
This investigator demonstrated combus
tion to be a union with one of the con
stituents of the atmosphere, a gas which
Priestly and Scheule had discovered and
which Lavoisier named oxygen. Sub
stances in burning were shown to have
gained weight, and this gain in weight
was demonstrated to be commensurate
with a loss suffered by the air support
ing the process of burning. Chemical
elements, as they are to-day, were defined
as forms of matter which, when alone,
could not be changed into two or more
simpler bodies and the products of com
bustion were therefore shown to be com
pounds. Lavoisier's crowning work was
the final proof that water ls,<a compound
of hydrogen and oxygen and the firm
establishment of the law of constancy of
matter. A new system of nomenclature,
substantially the same as that of to-day,
was -introduced and the way was opened
for the marvelous advances made in the
nineteenth century.
After the death of Lavoisier, In 1792. a
host of earnest inv?stlgators carried on
his work; new elements and compounds
were discovered and by 1S06 the way was
clear for the establishment of the funda
mental law governing the composition of
chemical compounds known as the law of
constant proportions (Proust). All truo
chemical compounds were recognized as
having their constituent elements com
bined in constant and unvarying ratio by
weight, and although a bitter opposition
to this view was carried on by the emi
nent scientist Berthollet. the facts re
vealed by careful analysis established the
theory, and from that time all chemical
science was based upon their understand
ing. Almost simultaneously with this ad
vance. the present theory of atoms, which
has Â¦ been of Immeasurable benefit In the
progress of the science, was developed in
England by John Dalton, and the laws
governing the combining volumes of gases
were discovered by Gay-Lussac In France,
thus serving to firmly establish this
theory In the chemical world.
Chemical Industry received a preat
impetus from the intense activity
in the theoretical field. The isola
tion of France during the revo
lutionary period caused her to make
an earnest effort to supply chemicals pre
viously purchased abroad, and as a result
the Le Blanc process for the manufac
ture of soda originated there. Until re
cently It was the sole means of producing
this important chemical. Owing to the
possibility of the commercial production
of chlorine, bleaching powder came into
use: ammonia was generated In quantity
from the gasworks, which were Increas
ing Jn number, and the cultivation of the
sifgar beet and the mean3 of marketing
the product, a difficult chemical problem,
began to gain ground. / jr
The period In the history of chemistry
immediately following the understanding
of the law of definite .proportions was
until about 1S32 mainly devoted to defin
ing and enlarging the views already es
tablished, the principal object being to
Investigate the.subject of atomic weights,
which, were cjiemieal quantities defined
by Dalton, and about the exact Inter
pretation of which bitter controversy
Xglgned. The conflict thus precipitated
stimulated research and served to hasten
the discovery ol many new elements and
compounds and to. perfect the methods of
analysis. The Swedish chemist Berzelrus.
a man of endurance, untiring energy and
experimental skill far beyond that of any
of his contemporaries, was the most nota
ble figure In the chemical world of this
period. In addition to his pre-eminent
dexterity in the laboratory he was a vo
luminous writer. The results of his re
searches were compiled In a manual of
chemistry, which first appeared in the
Swedish language and. which was subse
quently translated Into German by his
friend Wohler. The general chemical field
was reviewed in an annual compilation.
By means of his activity and his excep
tional facility for bringing his views be
fore his colleagues Berzellus succeeded
during thirty years in completely domi
nating the science. .
â¢ The period from 1S06 to 1S45 was fruit
ful In the discovery and Isolation of new
elements, over twenty-five being: added to
the known list. Mineral analysis almost
reached the standard of the present day

NEW YORK. Aug. 9.â Quotations were hardly
more than nominal in the stock market to-day. I
There was not a single feature of striking in- j
terest in the day's trading and the aggregate I
number of shares sold fell below 100,000 for the
first time In several years on a full trading
day. There was a disposition to disregard the
weakness reflected from London in spite of the !
fact tl'at >,aJes for London account ran up j
to S9.C00 shares, which is a large total com- .
pared with the recent average, but declines 1
which resulted here were hardly more than mo- '
mentary. The variation during the latter part \
or the day was scrcely appreciable in most of j
the stocks traded in and the average level of
prices show an insignificant change to-day. It
was noticeable, however, that In any Indi
vidual stock in which a large order was exe
cuted the resulting price movement was wide.
This was true of either a selling order or a
buying. Chicago and XGrihwestern, for which
there was a buying order for several thousand
Fhares. was a conspicuous example, running
up nearly 4 points. A number of lately dor
mant stocks ran off sharply on selling orders.
Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburg rose 4 points
on a single transaction. Realizing in Rubber
cost that stock 2 points. The decision reported
by the syndicate which underwrote the Ameri
can allotment of the new British exchequer
bonds not to ship gold on Saturday caused sur
prise, in view of the obvious fact that the
liank of Er.gland based its maintenance of its
existing disccunt rate on the expectation of
early receipts of gold from the United States.
The decline in sterling exchange, which fell |
back to $4 SS, took away the profit as to ex- |
ports. As to our own money market, the pay
ment by the banks to the sub-treasury for the
gold bars exported has wiped out their earlier
Eains from that institution and established a
loss of J2.3S5.O0O. The interior currency move
ment, however, continues largely in favor of
New York, ar.d with speculation practically
stagnant money fell to-day to 1 per cent.
There was nothing of importance in the bond
market. Total sales, par value. J705.CO0. United
States new 4's declined "â¢Â« In the bid price.

CLOSING.
NEW" YORK, Aug. 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The rr.arkei here to-day was weak, mainly on
account of the lack of business, the prospect of
dearer money at the approaching settlement
next Monday and the rather bad news from
South Africa. The new exchequer bonds fell to
% premium on the apprehension which is quite
general that successful bidders for these se
curities will unload at the first chance for a
fair rrcflt. American stocks were featureless
on an idle market. The bank bought i22,000
pold in bars. It raised the buying prices Id to
77s lOd on bars, %d to 76s 5d on eagles and %d
on all other foreign coirs.
The bank returns show that the reserve is
down to J17.S71.CC0, which is the lowest figure
reached since January. 1S94.. The bank, how
ever, is obtaining control of the money market
and will probably be able to replenish its re
sources.

LOST THEIR FIGHT
The committee of Los Angeles Jobbers

their southern homes last night. Among
those who represented the merchants of
the southern metropolis were Thomas
Xewmark. F. W. Braun, J. O. Keefe and
w. c. Reynolds. While there was no
general conference yesterday between the
merchants, and the railroad people, the
jobbers were given to understand that
their claims were not considered of suf

RENOUNCES SILVER AND
JOINS M'KINLEY FORCES
ST PAUL. Aug. 9.â A Butte (Mont.)
special to the Pioneer Press says: Ex-
Senator Lee Mantle, chairman of the Sli
ver Republicans, has written a letter for
mally renouncing his allegiance to tnat
party and going back to the Republican
party. Mr. Mantle says in effect that the
silver question , is dead , ami It has
been practically abandoned b^Mhe Demo
crats and even by the delegates from Mon
tana to the national convention, where the
delegates from this State and the com
mlttee on resolutions refused to- vote on
the 16 to 1 question.
"To my mind, the paramount issue to
day is the issue of maintaining the honor
and dignity of the nation and the su
premacy of its flag wherever it is right
fullv floating. It is the issue whether we
shall preserve the fruits of all the blood
and treasure expended and all the splen
uld courage and patriotism exhibited in
the cause of humanity and in the deTense
of undeniable rights, or whether we shall
resolutely discharge the great obligations
which have devolved upon us or whether
we will abandon our advanced position,
throw down our arms, cravenly hoist the
white flag and admit to the world that we
are incapable of solving the problems
which confront us." 'Â¦".Â¦-:_"
RED MEN PASS A BUSY
DAY IN GRAND SESSION
ADAME SCALCHI, the famous
I I 1 Italian contralto, is the latest con-
I I 1 ccrt artlRt t0 take to the vaude-
I I ville etage. She will appear at the
" * Orpheum some time during the
present month, and the enterpris
ing management is to be congratulated on
the engagement. Scalchi's voice on the
occasion of her last visit here with Mme.
Nordlca and Barron Berthald, some four
or five years ago, showed no signs of
wear, and it Is to be hoped that the mag
nificent contralto that has delighted so
many thousands still retains its strength
and richness of quality.
Miss Jessie Padgham, whose successful
debut at the Orpheum was made a few
short weeks ago, has had some flattering
offers from managers since then. Among
those managerially interested In the
charming soprano is Phil Ryley of the
Dunne and Ryley company, now playing
at the California Theater, but MIsb
Padgham's certainly bright future Is as
yet undecided. She adds one more to the
long list of notable singers bred and born
in California.
Selma Kronold, the dramatic soprano
who made su^h a hit In "Gioconda" last
year during the grand opera season at
the Tlvoll Opera-houso with Albert Guille,
the popular little French tenor of Tav
/iry days, was recently arrested with a
niu'mber of others at Atlantic City for vio
lating the local Sabbath ordinance by
Blnglng secular songs on Sunday.
The Dramatic Mirror In commenting
upon the occurrence says that popular
sympathy la entirely with the offenders;
that other resorts besides the Auditorium
Pier, where the concert was held, were
giving equally unsanctifled fare, and that
"unfair discrimination had been shown."
The Fingers were each held in $3 bail.
The lmident inevitably suggests compar
ison?: What augmentation of the police
force would be required in San Francisco
to raid the resorts whose Sunday evening
repertoire is unconflned to Gregorian
chants and gospel hymns?
Mr. George M. Schutz the barytone, is
on a visit here and will give a song re
cital at Sherman & Clay's Hall In the
near future. It is possible that Mr. Schutz
may decide to make his home in this
city. He will at any rate not return to
Washington for some months.
A grand tour of the United States by
Edouard Straups and his great orchestra
Is announced by Manager Aronson. The
great band will appear in this city in
January next, and over a hundred towns
and cities will be visited during the tour.
Among the interesting features of the
programmes will be selections from the
operas and dance music < of the ' great
"waltz king." Johann Strauss, and also
new compositions by American composers.

months, have separated. Mrs. Bellc-
Oudry Is at the home of her mother. Mrs.
Davis, and the following notice appears
in a local paper:
VOTICEâ Ml persons are hereby cautioned not
to elv* credit or trust anyone whomsoever on
account of F.I. Itelle-Oudry. .photographer.

OUDRY.
According to both parties their few
months of married life were not so happy
as they might have been, and there were
frequent quarrels in which blows were
given and taken on each side. The final
dispute occurred on Sunday night when
the young wife asked the protection of
the police from the alleged brutal conduct
of her husband. With the coming of the
<:awn on Monday morning Mrs. Bell--
Oudry hurriedly packed her personal et
fects nnd while her husband slept she
stole away to her mother's home.
Mrs Belle-Oudry, who Is a petite blonde
snd well known as a vocalist, has con
fided in a number of her friends. To them
she tells a long s=tory of cruelty at the
hands of her husband, which culminated,
she F3vs. late last Sunday nighl when
he returned from San Francisco In a
state of intoxication and slapned her
fnce. To this, she says, she demurred
and left him.
The husband's story is different from
that of the young wife in that he claims
to have been the victim for months of
his wife's fists, and, when these did not
s<rve, of shoe brushes and other weapons
with which she belabored him about tha
head and body. This is his story:
"There is no truth whatever in th?.
statement that my wife required the ser
vices of a policeman last Sunday night.
The truth of the matter is that for some
time past she has abused me. Whenever
the whim struck her she would either slap
me or punch me In the face. Her on
slnlights were met with patience by me
until I could stand them no longer and
I told her that if she hit me again I
would certainly strike back. When she
slapped me the next time I returned the
blow. At times I have carried several
bruises as the result of beatings from
a heavy shoe brush. On one occasion she
ust-d a pair of heavy shoes.
â¢Â¦I^a.st Saturday my wife remained away
from home all day. As I needed her ser
vices at the gallery I was angry on her
return. The next day I made up my mind
to go to San Francisco and get good and
drtjnk. I really drank but little, but when
I returned, about midnight, I pretended to
he intoxicated. While asleep, several
hours later, my wife went after a police
man. When I awoke the next morning
my wife had gone.
"I have notified tradesmen not to trust
my wife for any goods In my name be
cause I fear she might bankrupt me.
During the time she was cashier at my
eallery she would appropriate sometimes
, as much as $30 a week."
Xelther of the parties will admit the
possibility of divorce proceedings. The
couple, were married last January. Before
her marriage Mrs. Relle-Oudry was Miss
Florence Mignon Davis.
NEW YORK. Aug. 9.â The hot wave
that arrived here several days ago con
tinued to-day, and the local forecaster'
gives no promise of early relief. At 5
o'clock this afternoon the temperature
had reached 93, 2"degrees higher than ever
before recorded here on this date. At 8
o'clock this morning 76 degrees was reach
ed. At 10 o'clock the thermometer regis
tered 10 degrees higher, but the humidity,
which had been very high early in the
morning, had dropped to 57 per cent.
From 1 o'clock until 5 the temperature
steadily rose to 93 degrees. On the street
it was 5 to 10 degrees hotter. From 3
o'clock the temperature diminished and at
10 p. m. was down at S4.
There were but few prostrations during
the day and only one death was reportect.
CHICAGO, Aug. S. â Hot weather records
for this city were broken to-day and will
be broken again on Friday and again on
Saturday, and probably for several more
days after that. The local forecaster will
not hazard a. guess of the. next three da.ys.
all of which he says will be of the samo
torrid nature as the last six days, and
he has fears of the weather in the more
distant future.
For twenty-five years, or since the
Weather Bureau was established, there
has been but one term of hot weather in
which the mercury reached 90 for live con
secutive days. The average maximum
temperature for those live days was 92.
There have now been six days on which
the temperature has gone above 5)0, and
the average maximum for the past six
days has been 93. To-day was the hottest
of the present spell, the mercury reaching
95 in the Auditorium tower at 3 o'clock.
On the street it was 2 degrees warmer
than in the tower.
The prolonged heat is having a serious
effect on business. All of those who can
leave the city for points ajong the lake
shore and the woods are going, and many
have materially curtailed their hours of
labor. . â¢
Gangs of laborers all over the city laid
off during the afternoon. There were four
deaths due to the heat and twenty-nine
prostrations, three of which are expected
to prove fatal.
The four deaths to-day makcv a total of
seventeen due directly to the heat. It is
estimated that over 100 deaths of people
already ill have been hastened by thÂ«
weather of this week.
For the week the mortality list has been
mounting with "great rapidity, the in
crease being attributed entirely to the
heat. There were 4C5 deaths last week,
and, with the present ratio of increase,
there will be 600 this week. The ratio of
deaths, according to the Coroner, will in
creape steadily as long as the hot weather
continues.
MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Aug. 9.â Three
deaths from heat resulted to-night.
Three prostrations were also reported.
CLEVELAND, Aug. 9.â Though the tem
perature did not exceed SG degrees to-day
the heat was depressing. There were
four prostrations.
DETROIT, Aug. 9. â There were four
prostrations In Detroit to-day from the
heat, but no deaths.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 9. â Three
deaths and twenty prostrations occurred
In this city to-day from heat.
The maximum temperature was reached
at 4 o"clock this afternoon, when 94 de
grees was registered on the Government
thermometer on the top of the Postoffice
building. In the streets, however, it was
much hotter, and thermometers placed in
the sun registered as high as 120.
At Easton Samuel Nevin, a prominent
merchant, died from the effects of the
hent.
At Chester nine men were overcome and
there was n general cessation of work in
the iron mills.
There were six prostrations at Kaston
and It is believed some of the cases will
prove fatal. : .

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Aug. 9.
Deprived of liberty and denied the right
to go to her mother because a bill for
her board is unpaid is the plight of little
Augusta Mathias of Hay wards. The
child's parent, Mrs. Louisa Schnorenberg,
has made these charges against' Mr. and
Mrs. John Silva and has sued out a writ
of habeas corpus to gain possession of
her imprisoned daughter.
This is the story contained in the peti
tion which Judge Hall to-day heard and
granted, directing the Silvas to produce
the girl in court next Wednesday, when
the facts will be narrated.
The aggrieved mother says that, some
time ago she was compelled to place her
daughter In the care of other persons
In looking for a suitable place the mother
discovered the Silvas. Terms were ar
ranged, but now there, has arisen trouble
over the iraymentof the board bill.
When Mrs. Sehnorenherg wanted her
daughter back, so her story runs, there
was a dispute about the umount for
which she was indebted to the Silvas.
When the parent flatly refused to accede
to their demands Mrs. Silva announced
that she would retain possession of the
girl until her bill should bo paid in full.
After many futile attempts to secure
possession of the girl the mother secured
legal advice, the result being that the
Silvas must show why they have not per
mitted the mother to have her own off
spring.

and at the end was only beaten by a head.
The track exactly suited Kinley Mack,

dead. Kinley Mack opened at 15 to 1 and
was. played down to 10 to 1. .
The mile was run In 1:41. After the race
the stewards summoned Starter Caldwell
before them and told him that unless he
secured a starting gate of his, own they
would insist on hi3 using the Clark bar
rier to-morrow.
Joyner, trainer of Ethelbert, announced
that he would not run another horse dur
ing the rest of the meeting. He offered
to match his employer's horse against
Kinley Mack, stipulating a good track,
but Wimmer, trainer of the latter horse,
declined to make the match. Results:

the Door of a Pacific Street
Residence.
Two bold attempts were made to rob
the residence of Anton Geantit of the San
Francisco moat market at Pacific and
Larkln streets Monday. In both cases the
same crooks participated, and their ef
forts were frustrated by Mrs. Geantit.
Special Officer Charles Manhke made a
report of the affair at the Californla-
Ktre*t police station and gave a descrip
tion of the men.
On Monday afternoon Mrs> Geantit vis
ited some friends, and when she returned
to her home she found two men opening
the front door with skeleton keys. When
they saw the woman they^ stated they
were sewing machine agents and had been
sent to fix a machine In the house. They
were told that no demand had been made
for their services, whereupon they apolo
gized and retired.
That night the same two men loitered
In the shade of a building across the street
and the woman soon noticed them there.
She watched from a window and saw
them finally cross to her home and enter
the front vestibule. Her husband came
along shortly, afterward and she called to
him and informed him of what was going
on. â¢ .He .followed the burglars in the
house, but when they were surprised they
showed tight and made their escape. Spe
cial Manhke was soon on' the scene, but
could find no trace of them.
BURGLARS VISIT SAME

Mr. Marshall obtained definite informa
tion about his absconding employe from
the captain of the Cleveland during the
voyage to Srattle. On arriving at that
port inquiries were made that led him to
believe Solomon had "skipped" to Can
nVla. Marshall arrived in Seattle on
Thursday last and came immediately to
this city.
Marshall takÂ«s his loss philosophically.
He said hnd Solomon acted squarely It
Â¦would have been impossible for the enter
prise to succeed, as conditions were
against it. >
Fortunately for Mr. Marshall he did not
sond all his wares by the two boats. He
had a large quantity of goods on the
steamer which carried him to his desti
nation, but seeing his Inability to secure
ground for his enterprise and learning of
the ill success of "Lucky" Baldwin and
John Farley, both of this city, he gave
up his project. As prices on the goods
he brought with him were depreciating
he hurriedly sold his lot and returnotl to
home on the Cleveland. A number of the
artists secured employment in Nome and
the others returned to civilization.
When Mr. Marshall and his charges ar
rived at Nome they were astounded at
the cheerless reception that awaited
thorn. They were compelled to camp on
the beach and they hurled maledictions
at the faithless employe. An Investigation
developed tho fact that Solomon had dis
puted of everything. Some of the goods
and lumber were unearthed, but Mr. Mar
shall was unable to secure possession be
cause witnesses were afraid to come for
ward and testify. Acting- Chief of Police
Tiddy of Nome lent Mr. Marshall all the
aid in his power, but nothing could be
done. Trace was found of the absconding
man. but he was beyond the reach of the
law.
It was Mr. Marshall's intention to ac
company his freight to Nome, but at the
last moment the ladles of the troupe de
clined to go unless under his protecting
wing. This made it necessary for him to
postpone his departure; and he sent Solo
mon as his substitute. Solomon left on
the Thrasher, which sailed from this port
on April 22. -Part of the freight was on
that vessel and part of It was on the
Jeannle, which sailed the following day.
Both vessels arrived at Nome the latter
part of May. It was Solomon's duty to
rent or lease a site upon which the build
ing could be erected. He had been given
nearly $1000 to carry out the project, but.
according to Mr. Marshall, he proved
faithless. Before the Valencia, which
bore Marshall and the vaudeville artists,
could reach port, Solomon had disposed
of the lumber, liquors and tobacco and
had hurriedly departed for Seattle, pass
ins his employer in mldocean.
During the excitement attendant on the
discovery of gold in the Nome region, the
Marshalls became intently interested, and
decided to follow in the footsteps of
"Lucky" Baldwin and take a nuraoer of
eingers and dancing girls and also a quan
tity of liquors into the new country- They
Invested JlO.i/X). With the money they
bought champagnes, liquors, cigars, dgar
? ttes and tobacco; pianos, pianolas, hard
ware, glassware, bar fixtures and other
saloon fixtures. A portable house 25 by 65
feet, containing 12,000 feet of lumber, was
built In this city, and 2000 additional feet
of lumber was ordered for partitions and
other Improvements. The vaudeville ar
tists were engaged, their tickets bought
and everything was In readiness for an
attack on the shekels and gold dust of the
northern miners.
Solomon is a young Englishman and
comes of a well-known family. He was
employed during the past year as clerk In
the cigar store conducted by Jacob
Schwartz at 34 Eddy street. While acting
as clerk Â£e became acquainted with the
Marshulis, whose saloon adjoins tho cigar
stand. The Marshall^ were greatly im
pressed with the clerk and learned to like
nim.
James B. Marshall of the Brighton
returned from Nome a few days- ago a
sadder but wiser man. He .went; to the
land of the midnight sun with hopes of in
creasing his fortune, but they were blasted
through the dishonesty of Frederick Solo
mon, a young man in whom he had placed
Implicit faith. Mr. Marshall and his
brother, Captain James H. Marshall, are
bemoanine the loss of more than. $5000.
The money or its equivalent, they say,
was stolen by Solomon. Solomon is now
somewhere in the "Canadian region, far
away from the hands of the law and the
wrath of his employers.

John F. Farley, epicure, Shakespearean
student and owner of the-Peerless saloon,
returned from Nome last night via Seat
tle. .He tells an interesting story., of his
three months' trip up In the northern
country.
"The Nome country Is very rich in
gold,'.' ; he said when < Interviewed last
night, "but the trouble of the whole re
gion is ..that there, is. not enough water.
In fact, there is no i water at all to .work
the claims. The old-timers of Nome say
this Is the dryest summer they have ever
known, and till there Is a rain the claims
cannot be worked to good advantage. An
other evil is that there -are large num
bers of men. up there who own all the
way. from live to ten claims, and they are
nominally penniless, but will not sell their
claims except for a -fancy figure. The
beach at- Nome Is very much like the Clift
House, beach, only the . sands are either
black or of a ruby color.
"E. J. Baldwin lias. opened a gambling
nnd dance hall about five miles, out of
Nome, but I do not- think. his venture is
a good one. Sam Dannenbaum has a good
cigar ptore on the main street tfnd Is mak
ing piles of money. The report that
Wyatt Earp was shot at Nome Is not
true. ,The police', service- by the soldiers
Is" excellent. -General Randall Is doing
splendid work.. The . town is not under
martial law; but the streets are patrolled
! at night by the soldiers with fixed bayo
nets.!
Â¦ ."The Hobbs boys' have i Just#Btarted a
brewery and are ; doing : well. - I have as
the v. fruits â¢ of :' my . trip an : Interest In : a
claim from which I expect good results.
The sanitary condition of the town Is fair,
but if anybody is taken- with" an illness
he is almost-sure to die. '"Whether.! shall
return to Nome or.not is a hard matter
to decide." .-..-Â¦â¢
John Farley was accompanied back on
his trip by Charlie Asher. the well-known
sporting man, 'who corroborates Farley's
statements.

FOUR ships arrived from European
ports yesterday; and three of them
tell hard luck stories. One was
driven into the" frozen scuth and
had a terrible time getting around the
Horn, another was on her beam ends and
was compelled to drift toward the south
pole in order to get her cargo put back
in place, while the third lost the master
and owner from Panama fever and dys
entery.
The British ship King George was 153
days getting here from Antwerp. She was
driven so far south that the blocks froze
and the running gear could not be worked.
All the ship carried were the topsails, and
these froze stiff. There was not a breath
of wind, and at one time it looked to Cap
tain Burnett as If the ship would drift
clean to the south pole.
In his report Captain Durnett says that
at times it was necessary to heat the
frozen ropes In order to make them run
through the blocks. On May 21, when the
sun came out, the ship looked like . a
model done In ice. On June 2 a terrlllc

WATER FRONT NOTES.
The British ship Milverton had a lively
time of it oft* the Horn. She was thirty
days getting from 50 in the Atlantic to 50
in i he Pacific, and not only lost a suit ot
sails but was on her beam ends and at the
mercy of the elements. Luckily she drift

was able to get her on an even keel again.
The Milverton was 153 days from Ant

into consideration It was a fair trip.

cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, for softening, -whitening, and
healing red, rough, and soro hands, in the form of baths
for annoying irritations, inflammations, and chafings, or
too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes,
for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative antiseptic
purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, and
especially mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet,
bath, and nursery. No amount of persuasion can induce
those who have once used it to use any other, especially
for preserving and purifying tho skin, scalp, and hair of
infants and children. Â© Cuticura Soap combines delicate
emollient properties derived from Cuticura, the great
skin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and tho
most refreshing of flower odors. No other medicated or
toilet soap ever compounded is to be compared with it
for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, scalp,
hair, and hands. No other foreign or domestic toilet soap,
however expensive, is to be compared with it for all the
purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it com-
bines in One Soap at One Price, viz., Twenty-Five Cents,
the best skin and complexion soap, tho best toilet and
best baby soap in the world. "" '
