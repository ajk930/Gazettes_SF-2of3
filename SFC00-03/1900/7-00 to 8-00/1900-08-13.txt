War. and M. de Lanessan, Min
ipl<?r of Marine, arriwd here this, morn
ir.jr and proceeded immediately to the re
viewing grounds, where they 'inspected
the Chinese expeditionary corps. There
was much enthusiasm, with cries of
"Vive Loubet'." "Vive la Renublique,"
arili "Vive I'Armec!" The cheering was
continuous.
After the review II. Loubet. taking his
position on the reviewing stand to present
. v<> flag: to the corps, said:
W 'In the name of the republic I deliver
to you the flags of the expeditionary
enrps. They are confided to your loyalty
and patriotism, which I guarantee.
j â¢â¢ 'Honor the fatherland* la your motto.
Soon you will subscribe upon their folds,
the name of a campaign rendered neces
sary by the violation of our right*, the
disregard of our legitimate interests and
the brutal assaults made upon those who
represent us In China. .
"Officers, non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, let these flags be to you a sacred
gift. They recall the lofty mission- of
France, a mission confided to your cour
age, to exact from a country where; the
essential laws of civilized countries have
been odiously violated the, chastisement of
the guilty and to. impose some, vivid "In
demnities for. the past' with necessary
guarantees for the future. , They tell ' you

CALI, HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Aug.
12. â Twenty warships representing the powers of the world are concentrated
at Shanghai and more are proceeding to that point. â¢
It wa.s learned to-day on excellent authority that the German Govern-.
ment has ordered a squadron of warships to sail at once for Shanghai. . No in
formation has boon received in Washington confirmatory of the -report that 5000 â¢
German troops have been ordered there. Germany's action is the result of the an
nounced purpose of Great Britain to land S000 British troops in Shanghai, ostensi
bly fcr the protection of the foreign settlomonts.
Shanghai has assumed an Importance In international diplomacy that can only
b*> losÂ«t by Great Britain's revocation of her orders for troops to proceed or by a
promp: settlement of the whole Chinese question. The German warships have gone
to Shanghai to protect the German interests, not only in that port,
l>ut in the whole cf the Yangtse Valley, and as these are of Immense value the
Kaiser would undoubtedly object to the acquisition of this great territory by the
UritSsh Government, which haa hitherto contented itself with declaring that It
phall be always open to the trade of the world. The best information obtainable
h^rc is that Japan will not formally object to the landing of the British troops at
Shang-hai. .

FRANCE GIVES WARNING TO CHINA.
PARIS, Aug 12. 10:30 p. m.â The Tsung 11 Tamen forwarded through the Chi
nese Minister in Paris. Tu Kons. a message to the French Government com
plaining of the "tardiness of the foreign Ministers In Peking in replying to
the offer of the Chinese Government to conduct their escort." The message
proceeded to eay that the Tsung 11 Yamen declined to be responsible for any casu
alties which might follow this delay, and Insisted that the European Governments
order their representatives to leave Peking. To this communication M. Delcasse,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent the following reply:
"No order to depart from Peking will be given to our Minister so
long as the route is unsafe. If a casualty occurs the responsibility -will
be entirely with the Chinese Government. Its strict duty is to protect
foreign Ministers, even more than its own.
"If it be trur that the Chinese Government has great difficulty In defending
them and in defending itfw-lf against rebels, it should order its troops to stand
aside before the allied forces. This would render free the road from Tientsin to
the capital and would accomplish the work of protection which is Incumbered.
The Chinese Government should understand that the only means of proving the
6lncÂ«rity of Its designs and of limiting its responsibility is a cessation in the plac
ing of obstacles In the way of euch an arrangement."
PABJS, Aug. 12.â The Patrle publishes the following: "The pro
cureur general of the congregation of the Lazarist missions, Mon
signor Bsttembourg-, informs us that he has just been advised
by TSL. Delcasse that, according to a dispatch from the French."
Consul General at Shanghai, received yesterday, 7000 Christians have
b?en massacred at Paoting, east of Peking. No other details are at
hand."
The French Foreign Office received this morning from M. Plchor.. French
Minister at Poking, what Is evidently the delayed dispatch which 'he referred to
in thÂ«> first messag-e received from him. published here last Thursday as "my
cipher ?Co. 1. dated Augrust 3." It is as follows:
â¢'From June 20 to July 17 Chinese troops besieged, fired upon and bombarded
us. Four legations have been burned and that of France three-quarters destroy
ed. We still hold out. thanks to the heroic defense of the Franco-Austrian de
tachment. Our loss Is sixteen. The general loss Is sixty more and 110 wounded.
All the missions in Peking have been burned, save the Peitang mission, which
Is standing, but Its condition is uncertain. Despite anguish and privations the
members of the legation are In good health.
â¢The bombardment ceased on July 11. Offensive works, Chinese barricades
and intermittently shots continue without victims. The Government Is attempt
ing indirectly to negotiate with us for our departure; but wo cannot leave with
our Fome protection other than that of the Government.
"Our forces, ammunition and provisions are almost exhausted. The Inter
rupted attacks may recommence and place us at the mercy of the Chinese Gov
ernment. On July IS I received a telegram which I was not allowed to reply
to in cipher."

demolished. The railroad men on the train
declare it was the most complete, smash
up they ever saw.
On board the train were 150 people, and
the fact that only one boy was killed la
beyond explanation. Fred Chattin was the
unfortunate boy's name. He was the son
of Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Chattin, also on
the train. Mrs. Chattin. who had a baby
in her arms, was seriously hurt on the
head. The boy was asleep by an open

was thrown partly out of the window, the
car falling upon him and breaking his
neck. '
A brakeman's hand was slightly hurt,
and Lucius O'Brian, mail clerk, was bad
ly bruised on the arm. and shoulder. All
others on the - train miraculously escaped
without a bruise. The news of the wrecx
caused great apprehension in Lake
Charles, as there were a number of Lake
Charles people on boards A Ozst I rumor -
said forty were killed.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â Acting Secretary of State Adee this aft
ernoon handed to Mr. Chung Mun Yew, secretary-interpreter of
the Chinese legation, 1 the : . note prepared by Secretary ..Root and
himself and approved by Mr. McKinley, accepting Li Hung Chang as
China's representative to treat for peace, provided this remaining con

Emperor of China, be complied with:"
"To place the imperial authorities of China in communication with
the relief expedition,' so that co-operation may be secured between them
for the liberation of the legations, the protection of foreigners and tha
restoration of order."
In Â¦ his reply to the Chinese Emperor's appeal for mediation the
President announced that if these objects were accomplished "it is the
belief of this Government that no obstacles will'be found to exist on
/the part of the powers to an amicable settlement of all the questions
arising out of the recent troubles, and the friendly good offices of this
Government will, with the assent of the other, powers, be cheerfully

ernoon when the circular instruction, embodying the decree appointing
iii: Hung Chang and, the President's response thereto, was cabled to our
representatives abroad, with. the request that they present it to the Gov
ernments to which' they are accredited. There will be an active inter
change; of views,; but the demand of the United States for the liberation
of i the Ministers as a preliminary. to the negotiations will, the authori

CONGER'S ME'SSAGE EVIDENTLY DELAYED-
WASHINGTON. Aug. 12.â The War Department's dispatch from Minister Con
ger transmitted through General Chaff ee, had evidently been delayed long
In reaching Chaff ee. as his own dispatch was dated four days ago." It is
presumed the dispatch of General Chaffce was .Jated at Yangtsun and that
an error was made In transmission. While the message of Minister Conger con
tains nothing new. It is encouraging to the odcials to have renewed assurances of
his ability and determination to "hold" until relief reaches him. That General
Chailee will communicate to the besieged Minister tidings of hope and good cheer,
if the opportunity be afforded him. . officials here -are -certain. Minister- Conger's
expression of hop* that th% long looked for relief may scon reach him simply, adds
to the determination of the Government tÂ» press forward to Peking as rapidly as
possible. It is evident that the distance half-way to Peking has been covered.

"This monstrous effort will fall. It has
already failed, I am certain. Is not the

LOUBET REVIEWS

BERLIN'. Aug. li-Field Marshal Count
von Waldereee. according to the Ber
liner.Tareblalt. will go on a special mis
sion to Renw before tailing for China.
VON WALDFRSEE WILL
FIRST GO TO ROME
ThÂ«? attitude assumed by the diplomatic
representativ.ws of European Governments
in \Yashinjrion is pufficient evidence that
th<Â» powers 'will* preps vigorously the de
mands that they have mad<Â» upon the Chi
roso Government. To Peking the allied
armies will go. it is declared frankly, un
less every demand is arooded to and all
possible reparation Is made by China for
the damages already committed.
â¢
JCo replyâ at least no direct replyâ has
be^n l eceived yet to the memorandum
transmitted to the Chinese Government
through Minister \Yu by the Department
of Stale. It may be that the Imperative
demands contained in the memorandum
induced the promulgation of the edict de
livered to this Government to-day; but
the edi^t in itself is not accepted as a re
ply to those demands.
Minister Wu is Inclined to take an op
timistic view of the situation, but it can
be said authoritatively that his view is
not shared in fully by the Washington of
ficials. There is no disposition evident to
day to abate by one single jot the de
mands which have been made upon China,
A strong hope Is expressed, however, that
the Chinese Government will accede to
the demands eventually, and perhaps
vory' soon. This, Is based upon the edict
crpolnting Earl Li to sue tnr peace. To
this extent it may be said that the view
of the officials here is optimistic.
l*ntil these demands have been acceded
to It is regarded as highly improbable
that the Government of the United States
or any of the European Governments, all
of which have made the same demands
upon China, will consent to a "cessation
of hostile demonstrations" which are be
ing conducted, at least so far as this Gov
ernment is concerned, with the sole pur
pose of succoring the besieged legatloners
:n the Chinese capital.
In the day Acting Secretary Adee made
public the text of the edict.
While it is conceded by the Washington
officials that the conference of plenary
authority ui>on Earl Li to negotiate with
the powers for settlement of existing
troubles Is a Ftep in the right direction, it
is hy no means assured that the United
States Government will consent off-hand
to open negotiations with the distin
guiFhed Viceroy. The demands of this
Government upon China have been made
plainly and without equivocation. They
cannot be misunderstood. Assuming that
the Chinese Government is acting in pood
faith, the demands are reasonable and can
be complied with readily.

Imperative as is the need of troops in
the Philippines, the authorities,- to their
great regret, are compelled to begin ar
rangements for the withdrawal of volun
teers. Transports -which are now con
veying regulars to China will be used to
bring back â¢ volunteer regiments, which
under law must be - discharged In tho
United States before July 1.1001. .. , Â¦
If the backbone of China's resistance is
broken, as the authorities hope and an
amicable settlement of the Chinese ques
tion is accomplished, the regulars in
China will be ordered to the Philippines.
It is apparent, however, that the forces
In China cannot be withdrawn until ne
gotiations for. the solution of the Chinese
question are concluded, and In official cir
cles it is believed that these will con
tinue until next spring.
The withdrawal of 35.000 volunteers will
sadly curtail the military force in the
Philippines and necessitate the reduction
of garrisons.
In order to prevent recruiting to. the In

Secretary Hay made an ignoble surren

Senator said he would use his every effort

agreement set aside by a permanent ad
justment of the question.
Senator Mason is enthusiastic over the
wealth of the Porcupine district, and he
eaid his trip had given full realization of
the great importance of the territory

temporary agreement was rich was

USED STRATEGY IN
ARRESTING MADMAN
Special Officer Samuel Daggett used
strategy in arresting a violently Insane
soldier on Barbary Coast Saturday night*
and by employing the tactics that he did
he saved himself a desperate battle, which
would undoubtedly have resulted In injury
to the unfortunate tighter.
About 10 o'clock in the evening Das
gett, who was standing at Kearny ar.d
Pacific streets, was approached by John
Leahy, an Insane soldier, who escaped
from the Presidio some time ago. Before
the officer could realize what had happen
ed the soldier had him by the throat.
Dagrgett immediately saw that the man
was demented and a struggle commenced.
"Shall we charge on the enemy?"
shouted the soldier. "They are pressing
us hard." The speaker imagined that a
crowd of men behind him was a body of
Filipinos.
Daggett s&w his chance to use strategy
and not his club. Breaking himself loose
from the other's grasp he said:
"No. Let us retreat for reinforce
ments." . - â¢
The soldier. Innocent of any trick that
â¢was being played on him. followed Dag
gett on the run down Kearny street, at
the head of a curious mob, which served
to make the soldier more spry In his
movements. When California street was
reached E>agget turned the corner ami
lead Leahy into the police station. In
this place he was subdued with the as
sistance of four men, and handcuffed. He
was retunred to the Presidio yesterday.

James Edward Keeler was born in Illi
nois. September 8, 1857. His parents moved
to Florida while he was still a child, and
his boyhood was passed there. His mother

DK. JAMES EDWARD KEELER.
director of Lick Observatory, died
suddenly last evening at 6 o'clock
at the Waldeck Hospital of a
stroke of apoplexy, superinduced by heart
disease. He had been seriously- ailing
since Friday last, but death was not ex
pected. '
For nearly a month Dr. Keeler had been
enjoying a vacation from his duties at the
observatory, though making an occasional
visit to Mount Hamilton. Part of the
vacation was spent with relatives of his
wife at their country place on Clear Lake,
some distance from I^akeport. Dr. Keeler
had been troubled with a weak heart for
years. He found last week that he was
Browing worse. In particular he had dif
llculty in breathing. He decided to come
at once to SÂ«n Francisco to put himself
under a physician's care. With Mrs.
Keeler and their two children he arrived
here Friday evening and went to the Cali

After his undergraduate course-, young
Keeler went to Johns Hopkins University
In JS<8 for advanced work in physics. He
soon made his mark there and was given
a tellowshlp. He received the degree oC
fi â¢ ,,â¢ amon S the first upon whom Johns
Hopkins conferred that honor. During
his work at that university he was a mem
ber of the solar eclipse expedition sent to
Colorado in 1S78. Before he received his
degree he went with Professor Lansley on
the famous Mount Whitney expedition
for the study of solar physics.
Dr. Keeler went abroad for two years
after leaving Johns Hopkins and rtu.iie.i
with Juincke at Heidelberg and Von
Helmholts at Berlin. In 1SSG he was mads
an astronomer at Lick Observatorv
which position he held with honor until
five years later, when he was elected Di

Langley of the Smithsonian lnstitut;on.
Dr. Keeler was one of the most eminent
astronomers in the United States and h:"3
death is' an irreparable loss to science.
His achievements in spectroscopy have
made him famous among astronomers the
world over. Since coming to Lick Ob
servatory he has devoted himself particu
larly to photographing nebulae. He has
had in preparation a very elaborate work
embodying his researches In, that line. He
planned to devote two years more to it3
preparation before giving it to the world.
Now that he is cut down in his prime the
work will remain uncompleted, no one
else being qualified to carry it on from the
point where he left It. m

POPULISTS PLAN FOR
A BIG DEMONSTRATION
Yuba County Estoppel Suit
Demands Action of Min
er's Association.
There are signs of renewed war be
tween the miners and the farmers as a
result of the decision of the Superior
Judge of Yuba County In the Injunction
case against the diggers of gold. Owing
to the fact that the decision clashes vital
ly with the Caminetti law and prac
tically makes it a dead letter, there Is
much anxiety among the mining men,
and they want to ascertain where they
are located as between the Federal law
and the law laid down by the State
court. In consequence, a meeting of the
executive committee of the California
Miners' Association has been called, and
It will endeavor to-day to solve the
difficult problem that has been pre
sented. .
The Yuba County court issued an in
junction against Nichols brothers of Dutch
Flat, enjoining them from continuing
their operations as hydraulic miners. The
clash arises over the fact that the.par
ties In question were operating by a per
mit issued under the law by the legally
constituted Commissioners. The Cam
inetti law was supposed to be the re-
Juvenator of hydraulic mining in this
State, but the action of the up-country
Judge knocks all the calculations into a
Jumble. A part of the business of the
meeting will be ' to ascertain whether
the enjoined miners were working
within the provisions of the law and
properly Impounding the debris.
If the restraining dam and other
appliances of the company in ques
tion were legal there will be trou
ble to prove the fact. and if
the Nichols brothers wenÂ» evading the
provlBions of the statute there will also
be trouble, for their plant was supposed
by the miners to be all right, and they
looked forward to successful operations
in the future. In whlqh the farmer would
not suffer, while the gold seeker would
mane "good money."<
In connection with this mining situa
tion, which blockades hydraulic work
throughout the State, the committee will
hear a report from ex-Congressman Cam
inetti and Attorney General Ford regard-
Ing their successful efforts to secure the
Immediate application of the Caminetti
law. It is anything but an easy problem
to solve, for It not only involves mighty
business Interests, but politics affecting
the election of a Congressman. There ap
pears to be war in the air, and to-day's
meeting should develop it The meeting
is to be held at Â«hÂ» Palace Hotel, and
other Important matters are to be
brought up.

o:i the wharf but a few minutes when
they noticed an object floating in the

though it might be a human body, and
th< v determined to invesUsate.
They procured a boat, and rowing out
discovered it to be the body of a woman.
Making fast to it they to-^-e<l it to the

a vide r>lank was secured. This was

to the c:d powder house, where it was
kept over night. It happened that at the
time of the discovery several campers
were on the b^-ach digging clams. They
assisted in taking the body to its crude

So certa.:i were the men that the body
was that of Mi?s Warren that they im

young lady's family in San Francisco.
The Coroner went to Tiburon this morning

A portion of the jury was secured at that
place and the balance near the scene of

Two friends and neighbors of the "War

morning and attended the inquest. The

v.esses testified as to how the body was
found and then came the identification by
MIfs Irene Day, who ha-d a small piece
of the material of which the dress that
Miss Warren wore on the fatal day was
made. This alone was enough, but fur
ther evidence for identification was dis
covered in a small gold cuffbutton, with a
diamond setting in the center, which was
found in the left cuff on the body. Several
small rings were found on the left hand,
which, tojretheowlth a pair of white duck
ties, plainly established the identity of the
body.
The body has been in the water several
weeks, and the bay had not treated it

dress and was thus protected. The small
hand looked o.ulte natural. Contact with
the rocks and wreckage of the bay had
torn the dress to rags, and the body was
terribly bruised.
After the inriuest the jury returned a
verdict of accidental drowning and the
body was turned over to a San Francisco
undertaking firm and shipped across the
bay on the 1:10 boat.
It Is believed by many who know the
bay that It was Miss Warren's body that
was seen drifting out of Richardsons Bay
some days ago and reported in The Call.
At thÂ»* time it was thought tha.t a strong
current had carried It into the straits.
The finding of the body last night seema
to strengthen this theory.

at the expected hour, and the next day
searching parties visited every cove and
Inlet in the vicinity of where they were
last seen, but no trace of the missing
couple could be found. A party of yachts
men told of having seen a small boat go
down in Raccoon Straits, and the search
for the living gave place to one for the
dead. The body of Kelly was found near
Vallejo two weeks ago.

FRESNO, Aug. 12.-Assistant District
Attorney Edwards has filed an informa

and Frankie Himes and Elmer Martin
with murder. They will be arraigned be
fore .the higher tribunal in a few days,
when a date will be lixed tor their trial.
Whether the boys will be tried separate
ly or together has not yet been decided.
The District Attorney expects to encoun
ter considerable difficulty in securing: a
jury to try the case, inasmuch as the
crime has been given tne greatest pub
licity and the boys have many sympathiz
ers on account of their extreme youth.
Mrs. Archie Combs, a sister of Fred
Himes' mother, called on the boy at the
jail to-day. She had just returned from
Santa Cruz, where she attended the
funeral of Hime3. Mrs. Combs told Fred
that he had many friends at Santa Cruz
who would testify regarding his father's
cruelty to him. This encouraced the lad
and he was apparently in a happy frame
of mind when a Call correspondent called
on him a few minutes later.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
The duty of every honest Republican at this time
is plain. He who has not registered should attend to
it at once. He who has not enrolled should straight
way do so. The fight for genuine Republicanism in
the city, the State and the nation cannot be won by
talking. There must be action. Register and enroll,
and then see to it that your friends do the same.
The contest is to be an important one for the State
as well as for the nation. Free silver cranks, free
traders, Populists and all other political vagarists or
fanatics have banded together under the lead of Bryan,
and there is, therefore, in the national field an oppor
tunity to defeat all of them at one swoop. Some
thing of the same sort is to be found in the State con
test. The railroad is fighting to obtain control of the
Legislature, and all the local bosses have combined
with it. Herrin, Kelly and Crimmins work together,
and the Democratic bosses are lurking in the shadow
ready â¢ to help them. Thus the whole corrupt and
corrupting forces of the city are on one side. A vic
tory for genuine Republicanism now will crush, the
whole gang.
When you have registered, then enroll yourself in
the Republican club of your district and attend all its
meetings, so as to keep in close touch with the cam
paign at every step uf its progress and ready to act
in behalf of genuine Republicanism and honest poli
tics.
GET your name on the great register. There
are a good many of you who have neglected
that duty of a citizen. The closing days of reg
istration will see a rush at the Registrar's office, and
then it will be troublesome and inconvenient, by rea
son of the rush. Better attend to the duty at once.

Why does the association which is supposed to rep
resent the honor of the bar of San Francisco permit
a self-confessed criminal like Chretien to retain the
richts of an attorney? Why is James Taylor Rogers
allowed to continue to practice at the bar? The issue
iÂ« one which the better members of the bar cannot
evade. It is up to them. If Chretien and Rogers are
not to be disbarred, the public will make a shrewd
guess at the reason why.
Thus far the press has done its full duty in trying
to bring the guilty .attorneys and their fellow-con
spirators to answer for the wrong they have com
mitted not only against the rightful heirs of Sullivan
but against society itself. The Grand Jury has acted
and the court has upheld the action of the jury. To
that extent all is satisfactory, but there remains one
other power in the community 'from which action is
expected, but from which no action has come. What
is themntter with the 'Bar Association?
Frederick Hansted, charged with connection with
the conspiracy, is now in jail in this city, arid asserts
he came back for the purpose of meeting the charge
and proving the falseness of it. He has declared he
will go into court this morning "refreshed and ready
to prove that the charges made by Chretien are false
as he has been proven."
The testimony Hansted is likely to give and the
proceedings against Rogers will doubtless aid ma
terially in bringing to light any still hidden secrets of
the conspiracy which The Call was fortunately able
to expos- in time to prevent the final distribution of
the estate. Possibly, in the new light which .is thus
to be thrown on the affair, some other rascal may be
brought w thin reach of the law, and thus justice be
able to attain a completer triumph than would other
wise be possible.
JOHN T. GREANY, Assistant District Attor
ney, has begun proceedings to collect from
James Taylor Rogers the $500 fine imposed upon
Rogers for his refusal to answer questions before the
Grand Jury in relation to the conspiracy formed for
the purpose of looting the estate of the late Joseph
Sullivan.

Recent reports are to the effect that the French
Government having made successful tests with wire
less telegraphy over a distance of sixty miles is to
adopt an extensive system of such telegraphy along
the French coast. By and by the yellow journals will
learn that wireless telegraphy has come to stay and
then they will get in and claim it as a scoop.
It appears the British are not to be permitted to play
a lone hand in the Shanghai district of China, for it is
said the Kaiser has resolved to send 5000 Germans
there to take part in the game, and now if the Mikado
would send some Japs over to assist the Russians in
Manchuria the lone hand terror that has been disturb
ing the powers would vanish from the horizon.
As far as San Francisco and California are con
cerned, much depends on the' course of events in
China. If a general war results there the demand for
fr-rm and orchard products in this market will be
rrcatly stimulated, nr.d indeed agents for different
rovcrnments have for several weeks been nosing
about among the commisison mcrchints for future
nt-otations. in view of a possible war demand. But it
China proposes peace, and obtains it. we will have to
do without this extra call for our products. In any
ovrnt. there will he a good movement in produce thU
fall, so the outlook for California is very good.
In the local situation there are few changes. The
agricultural outlook 'n California seems to be getting
better day after day. though the improvement is grad
ual. It has been pointed out in this column for two
mocthi that all crops are smaller than anticipated in
the spring, and buyer.- of all products, having finally
discovered this, are paying increased prices. This is
notably true in wool, hogs, grapes, dried fruit of all
kinds, canned fruits nnd vegetables, barley, oats^atid
hay. not to mention a number of minor products of
the soil. The reduction in tho wheat yield has not re
sulted in any marked improvement, because wheat is
vox a local but universal proposition, where the pro-
of the whole world has to be t:\ken into con
sideration, thougha decrcieein the yield of any one
important country of course modifies the situation
more or less.
In fact, the great staples are showing more tone.
The improvement in wool, which set in several weeks
ago, continues, and the primary markets all report
more activity, while the manufacturers are also buying
more freely. It is remarked, however, that this in
creased movement is ?t the expense of new business
as orders are not up to expectations. The Chinese
trouble has diminished the demand for coarse raw
cottons, but the other grades are less affected. The
spot demand for dry goods has been checked con
siderably by the hot weather, but fall orders are com
ing in more liberally. There are also heavy engage
ments for iron and steel products, particularly at
Pittsburg and Chicago, and steel bars are $4 per ton
higher in the West, where the manufacturers have sold
their output op to 'he close of the year. The pro
duction is being steadily diminished by further shut
ting down of mills, and it is supposed that this is help
ing the market. The boot and shoe trade continues
<!ull and unsatisfactory, and hides and leather are
still in the dumps, -xcept here in California, where
an improved demand for leather has lately been ob
served. It U noteworthy that the sharp decline in
quotations which characterized the spring months has
ceased, and that there is a reactionary movement
toward firmer prices for some goods.
TR^DE APPARENTLY IMPROVING.
7"* RADE reports from all pans of the country
s-how little change in the situation from the
previous week. Some profess to see improve
ment in certain lines, ,and it is noteworthy that none
teport any further decrease in business, which is a
good though negative sign. The bank clearings
show the same comparative decrease, week after week,
that last week being j6.2 per cent, the largest five
cities exhibting a loss, while the number of second
and third rate cities showing a gain is distinctly larger
than of late, which- is another indication that general
business throughout the country is gradually working
around to a firmer basis. The failures last week were
177. against 136 last year. When it is considered that
the weather last week was intensely hot all over the
country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic
seaboard, and that hot weather invariably checks
trade, it will be seen that if business were still de
clining in volume the loss in bank clearings would
be greater than the average for the past few weeks,
which is not the case. Hence, the inference is natural
that there is really an improvement in commercial

Dantzle. the Germania yard at Kiel. Vul
can yard at Stettin and to Weiheims
hafen and will shortly be taken in hand.
These five battleships are an Improve
ment on the Kaiser type, their dimensions*
being 413.6 feet length. 6S.83 feet beam and
24.83 feet draught, displacing 11.500 tons.
They will have triple screw engines of
lo.OWV-horsepower. calculated to give a
speed of ID knots arid have a bunker ca
pacity of l'lOO tons. The armament con
sists of four 9.6-lnoh guns In two 10-inch
turrets, eighteen 6-inch quick-firers in
broadside and turrets, protected by 6-inrh
armors: twelve 3.32-inch, twelve 1.43-Inch
and eisht machine guns, making a total
of fifty-four guns. The axis of the for
ward heavy guns will be SO feet above
waterllne and of the after guns 21.5 feet.
The ships will have two torpedo tuhf>s
on each broadshide. one In the stern anil
one\n the stem. The Krupp armor belt
Is from 9 inches to 4 Inchrs thick. Tho
cost of each ship is estimated at 5I.1^2.5*H)
for hull and machinery. $l.i">O.0OiÂ» for arr^i
ament and $177,500 for torpedoes, a toii^
cost of $c..590.000. which is only $300,000 lesi
than the cost of the American battleships
Alabama and Kcarsarge of about 12.0m
tons. The Wtttlesbach will be ready for
her guns by April 1, 190*
The French submarine boat Morse does
not appear to be a great success, as com
pared with the Holland type adopted in
this country- The Morse Is 120 feet in
length, 9.2 feet beam and displaces 146
tons. She has a surface speed of 12.3
knots with two and a half tons spars
buoyancy and her endurance under that
condition Is 150 knots at a speed of 5U
knots. She can be submersed in four
minutes and It requires fourteen mlnutea
to turn her completely around. When en
tlroly submerged and using electric motors
only for propulsion her traveling distance
is twenty-five miles at eight knots and
ninety miles at five knots. The comple^
ment is one officer and nine men.
British naval vessels have nicknames
bs well as merchant ships and the people
that man them. The battleship Resolu
tion prior to being fitted with bilge-keels
was dubbed the "rolling Resolution." but
as she has got over that uncomfortable
feeling the old name has been dropped
and she Is called "Rcso" for short. The
Prince George Is known as the "O. P.,"
the Mngniflcent as "Magnificat." "Mag
gie" or the "Mag." "Hannah Ball" la
what the sailors call the Hannibal, and
"Jew Peter" comes pretty close to Jupiter.
The Howe is known as "Anyhow." the
coast-guard ships are known as "Gobies,"
the Trafalgar is abbreviated to "Trafy"
and thÂ« Nile is nicknamed "the Jew."
A commission has been appointed by
the British Admiralty to inquire into the
causes of failures of water-tube boilers
In the navy. The Inquiry will go thor
oughly Into the subject and the report will
be of the greatest Interest and value to
naval and mercantile people. The boiler
trouble Is practically confined to the Â¦
Belleville type alone, and as France Is
steadily Increasing its use In the navy
It would Indicate that no trouble Is ex
perienced with the Belleville boiler In that
country and that its alleged failure in the
British navy Is chieflly due to Inexperi
ence and Ignorance of stokers and engi
neers In her Majesty's navy.
The British cruiser Europa is alleged to
have consumed coal at the rate of flvÂ«
pounds per horsepower during her recent
voyaire to Australia. On the other hand
the battleship Goliah. fitted with the
same type of boilers as the Europa. used
only two pounds of coal per horsepower
on her run from England to Gibraltar.
This extraordinary discrepancy would
Indicate that the fault lies with the boiler
room force rather than with the boilers.
The supplementary British naval esti
mates for the present year amount to
$6,a-fS.50O, among the items of which are
$1,753,000 for the purchase of five torpedo
boat destroyers: $400,000 for bulldinjr a
repair ship and JSS.OJO for the placins of
Maxim prvins where old machine sruns
were hitherto used. The supplementary
estimate brings the total naval estimates
for the year up to $143,959,500.
The turbine propeller boat Viper was
tried for speed on July 13 off the River
Tyne for one hour. On two continuous
runs over the measured mile the boat
nveraped 36.S3 knots, and the average
of six runs was 36.58 knots.
Another dock is to be built at Chatham
dockyard, bringing the number up to ten.
equal to that of the three principal navy
yards in the United States.

MISS ALICE HAGEB.
Other constituencies may well profit by the wis
dom of the Republicans of the Fifth. The Repub
licans of the Third have set them a good example.
Mr. Metcalf's rcnomination being now assured he
should be re-elected by an overwhelming vote. He
merits the support not only of all Republicans but of
all independent voters and of that strong body of
conservative Democrats who are desirous of ridding
their party of Bryanites who are now controlling it.
It is an issue that appeals to all citizens, for it means
that California in Congress shall be inferior in power
and influence to none of her sister States.
The people of the Fifth District have long re
elected Mr. Loud term after term, and they have now
the satisfaction of seeing him chairman of one of the
most important committees of the House and within
a measurable distance of the Speakcrship itself. He
is sufficiently prominent to be regarded as an as
pirant for that high office, and consequently he has
a much more potent influence in all matters of legisla
tion than a new man could possibly have, no matter
how eloquent and energetic he might be.
When all California constituencies learn the advan
tage of having experienced men at Washington, Cali
fornia will* attain to her rightful prestige in the
Union. The older States have long since learned of
that advantage and consequently their power at Wash
ington is altogether out of proportion to their wealth
and population. A long term in Congress gives a
man an opportunity to learn the characters of the
leaders on both sides, to understand the workings of
committees, to make influential friends, to confer fa
\-ors which will be reciprocated, and in a hundred
ether ways acquire a personal influence in the House
which he can exert greatly to the advantage of hi3
constituents.
The record of Mr. Metcalf s first session in Con
gress gives promise that in him California will have an
able and influential representative. Speaker Hender
son and several of Mr. MetcalPs colleagues in the
House have borne witness not only to his fidelity to
his State and to his steadfast industry in attending
to his Congressional duties, but to his aptitude for
the work required of him. He makes friends easily
and has the faculty of retaining them. Few mem
bers in their first term attain so much success as he
has done, and it would have been a political blunder
of the worst kind had the Republicans of the Third
District set him aside for the purpose of electing a
new and inexperienced man to take his place.
CALIFORNIA IN CONGRESS
UPON the victory of Congressman Metcalf in the
Republican primaries in the Third District all
Californians may unite in congratulations.
There is nothing in this to reflect upon the character
of his principal competitor, Mr. Dalton. The satis
faction in the vote for Mr. Metcalf lies in the fact_
that it shows that '.California, constituencies are be
ginning to understand the importance of re-electing
to Congress representatives who have rendered faith
ful service and who have acquired in the House that
experience which is necessary to every member who
aspires to influence there.

SALLY SHARP GENTLY PRODS
THE APPLES IN THE SWIM
"JQ-aVERY one of us girls owes a vote of
; H% thanks to Alice Hager; she has
jl Â¦? broken away from the hard and
fast rule which makes a chaperon
a superfluous incumbrance. She has gone
her way beautifully Independent of
silly custom, :ind has constituted herself
all the chaperon she and her sister Ethel
need. We girls have always thought a
chaperon all kinds of a bore. It la not
unusual for the chaperoned party to have
to ko e p a watch on the chaperon. That
is why. we are. all looking: up to Alice
Hager Here's to her good common sense
that declares a sensible, self-respecting
girl Is a fit guardian for her younger sis
ter and that her own dignity is all the
protection she needs
By the display of that spirit the victory in. com
mittee was won, and by the exhibition of the same
sentiment and resolve the victory in the primaries
will be won. Boss candidates of the type of Dibble
and Wolfe cannot be elected in this campaign.
Those men have been tried in office and it has been
found that they represent neither the Republican
party nor any other class of the people. They are
indifferent to their constituencies and to the State
They are for themselves and for such corporations as
are noted for affiliation with corrupt legislators. No
such man will be permitted to masquerade* as a Re
publican this year. California needs an honest Legis
lature, and it is the duty of Republicans to do their
uttermost to supply that need.
In the contest in the County Committee the tools
of the bosses were beaten only because the stalwart
Republicans told them plainly they would not sub
mit to the control of Herrin, Kelly and Crimmins.
One honest member after another rose and warned
the gang that boss dictation would result in the defeat
at the polls of any corrupt rascal the bosses nomi
nated. They declared emphatically the decent Repub
licans of the different districts would not permit their
party to be dominated by Herrin, Kelly and Crim
mins. As Mr.- Metzner put it: "Republicans who sup
ported Horace Davis will not submit to be deprived of
their rights by the bosses."
I It is to be borne in mind, however, that what has
I been accomplished is nothing more than opening a
! way for fair dealing at the primaries. It is a sure
( thing the bosses will carry their fight there and make
it with all the vigor they have. It is not a battle they
I are going 4o shirk or to enter upon with any feeling
! of indifference. The Legislature that is to meet this
winter is to apportion the Assembly,, the Senatorial
and the Congressional districts of the State, and the
apportionments once made will stand for ten years.
Should the bosses have control of the Legislature
they can so gerrymander the State as to have virtual
domination in many cf the districts of each class. It
is to achieve that object Herrin is now working hand
1 in hand with Crimmins and his partners. It matters
! nothing to the "respectable" Mr. Herrin that Crim
| mins has been charged from the witness-stand in open
j court -with getting a 25 per cent rake-off from the
' profits of skin gambling games in return for "protec
j tion." In the game Herrin is playing any partner will
i do. Moreover, as his boss, Mr. Huntington, has fur-.
1 nished him with a long spoon he feels safe in supping
I with the devil.
It is against that gang of Mint saloon toughs and !
â¢ loafers, joined with the railroad supporters, that the
I honest Republicans of San Francisco have to make
I the fight in the primaries. To achieve victory there
needs resolution, unity of action, organization and
that universal earnestness among the rank and file
which will bring to the polling booths every public
; spirited and honest member of the party.
BY reason of the firmness of the men who 'rep
resented and upheld it in the Republican
County Committee on Saturday evening, the
cause of genuine Republicanism and honest politics
attained a victory over the combined forces of the
railroad and the Mint saloon bosses which promises
to yield' important results. By that victory a scheme
of the bosses to obtain control of the primary elec
tion boards was defeated, and decent Republicans can
now expect an honest supervision of the election of
delegates to the county convention.

Bear in mind the money is needed at once. Sub

celebration have the $50,000 before the end of the

Over and above such benefits as the city will derive
from the multitudes who will attend the celebration
are those that the city and State alike will share in the
repute which California will acquire by this new
demonstration of her wealth and her prosperity. The
attention of Eastern capitalists and home-seekers -will
be drawn to the State by the evidence of the richness
of her resources and the public spirit of her people,
and as a result we shall acquire great profit from this
patriotic form of advertising.
The festival will bring thousands of visitors td the
city and the trade of our merchants will be at once in-
Creased. From their hands the money will flow into
the general channelsof trade and tKere will be a quick

stimulus will be felt not only in the glory of the holi

There was a great old time in docking
the Occidental & Oriental Company's
Gaelic yesterday. The first attempt to get
her alongside the wharf failed. . The tide
was running like a mill-race and hawsers
would not hold. Then she was backed out
into the stream and anchored. Another
attempt was made, but it also failed, so
the mail boat was run across the end of
the wharf and the crew came ashore. At
hir-h tide the vessel was finally got along
side the wharf.

steamer St. Paul Is held in quarantine at

Nome via St. Michael early yesterday
morning, but was refused pratique, as
smallpox is said to be prevalent at Nome

hands will be held over at Angel Island
for at least a week. The St. Paul brought
down four boxes and two cases of treas

ship, even though the latter had a start
of a week.

from Nome City. The family had re

of the young man. and arrange
ments were made to have the remains
brought home as soon as possible. There
will be some delay from the fact that the
steamer was ordered into quarantine up
on arrival at San Francirco because of
smallpox existing at Nome City. ,
Immediatelv upon the release of the
vessel the body will be taken to Oak
land, where the funeral will be held, if
possible, on Tuesday.
When the Nome excitement broke out
Mr. Wheaton went to the new mining
camp in the Interests of the company.
He contracted pneumonia there and lived
only five days after he was stricken.
He was one of Oakland's popular so
ciety men and was only 2S years old when
he died.
The death of young Wheaton was a
sad shock to his many friends In this city
and Oakland. For several years
he had been a trusted agent of the Alas

I about the most popular man in Nome, ar.d
; his death is looted upon in the light of a
; general calamity. Before coming to Alas
' ka he. was with the firm of J. A. Folger
j & Co. of San Francisco, ami was one of
I the leaders among the younger members
; of the smart set on both sides of the bay.
\ Services over the corpse were held in tne
; Alaska Commercial Company's freight
shed to-day under the auspices of the
; Society Brothers, of which he was
; a member. Every one in the entire camp,
, irrespective of social cast or occupation,
: attended, and there v/as not one in the
Â¦ entire assemblage but who had something
! good to ?ay of the young fellow whose
unhappy end had come just as he was
, making his preparations for a visit to his
i home.
McKee*s Suicide.
Another sad occurrence was the suicide
: of Lester Howard Frank McKee. a Sun
Â¦ Francisco boy. who shot himself on Anvil
, I'reek v. bile temporarily insane. McKee
was a native of San Francisco and about
; SO years of age. He was at one time a
Â¦ member of G Company, First Infantry. I".
â¢ S. V., and was employed in the office of
, the Strckton water works before leaving
I home for this place. McKee leaves a
I mother and sister in San Francisco to
: mourn his loss. He was buried here.
i Still another death is that of Ole Holder).
| a carpenter, who fell and broke his neck
; while working on a building that is belnfÂ»
j erected here. Nothing was known of him
! beyond the fact that he w.is a member of
j *he Order of Red Men and had been for
| many years a resident of San Francisco.
I A body was discovered in the sand of
; the beach Thursday last by some men who
j were engaged in laying pipe. It was
badly decomposed and had no floubt been
buried for a long time. Tart of the skull
| was so crushed ;<s to lead to the supposi
i tion that murder had been committed,
i This theory wa^ strengthened by the find
: ing of a large hammer near by. The body
; has not yet been identified, but the au
: thorities are still actively at work on the
; case.
Several pood things, in a mining way.
i have been reported. The beach is said to
; be paying $20.<w> a day. and it probably is.
i This sounds big. but when one remembers
: that about 3000 nren are working it. it does
j not sound so good. Many prospectors are
j out on the hills, but as yet they have not
! come !n to tell us of their find:?. Some
| very rich bench diggings have been found
! on the divide between Anvil and Dexter
: creeks.
Refused 860,000 for a Claim.
A. Lorine- is the namaof one owner who
refused SGO.OOO for his claim. People think
him foolish, but he says he has a good
thing and means to stick to it. There are
a number of other rich claims in the im
mediate vicinity, but they suffer from the
same scarcity of water that is affecting
the output of the creek?.
Notwithstanding these Isolated cases
the camp is a cheap one and ia dal'v grow
ing eheai>er. Prices are tumbling all
along the line. Canned vegetables retail
at 25 cent?: meats are at 33 1-3 c?nts: a
can of butter may be purchased for 50
cents; flotir is onlv $2 50 a sack: milk and
cream are had at 23 cents: eggs are quoted
; at ?11 and J12 a ease, and me.ils that only
I cost 50 cents may be eaten. This !â¢? a fall
j of about 50 per cent all along the line.
Indigent poor continue to multiply and
| their care Is still an unsolved problem. A
[ subscription has been started to provide
i medic.il attention for the penniless sick,
but I fear that only enough will be collect
ed to show the lmpotency of the char
itably inclined.
BY FRED JÂ±. HEAL1T.
Special Correspondent of The Call at Nome.
NOME, J-uly 9.â Judging from the
passengtr lists of the b;g stram
erp that have been arriving from
the outside during the last few
days the Nome fever is com
mencing to abate and the temperature of
those afflicted -with the gold craze is rap
idly getting down to normal. The first
boats of this latest lot to arrive were the
Valencia., Orcgcr. and San Pedro, whose
combined passenger lists showed only a
total of 113 souls added to Nome's popu
lation since the Robert Dollar. Charles
Nelson and Centennial have come in
and the St. Paul has arrived at Su
llichael, sending her passengers over
here on the Dora. These vessels have
come up nearly as light as did the first
three.
The rush hoir.c. however, is getting
heavier every day ar.d the diflerer.t trans
portation companies i:i their efforts to
tpcure full r>a.sc-r.ser lists are cutting
rates in a way that would turn the
â¢whiskers of E. O. McCormlck gray in a
Â¦week. The different companies em;)ioy
runner; 1 , spielers ar.d sandwich men, who
traverse the streets ia all directions in
search of the cold-footed, who thoy hold
up and force a ticket upon if given the
slightest chance.
This is a good thinp for Nome, whose
population can stand a decrease of W.000
ar.d still leave the city sonvwhat over
crowded. The only unfortunate thing
about this rush to return home is that
It dors not seem to affect the criminal
classes.
Surplus of Undesirables.
The town is pimply overrun with
thieves, thugs, dissolute women and all
rour.d hard cases. This element is at
present kept wei! in hu:id by the military,
Â¦which, under the command of Capiain
French of the Seventh Infantry, is doing
Itself proud. But as soon as darkness
ccmes and the soldiers give way to civil
lars something: is poir.g to happen.
Xotwithstiindingr this general depres
sion, there is "somethin' doin' " all the
time, ar.d new metropolitan improve
ment? are daily becoming manifest. Nome
now has water works. . a telephone and
meesenper eyvtear, one railroad almost
complete arid another projected. The
completed line belongs to Captain Lane
and is live nii!es in length, running from
tidewater to the head of Anvil Creek. It
opens up the Anvil uud Dexter creek',
which, with their tributaries, constitute
the basis of Nome's linancial prosperity.
The read has been in working order somÂ«i
three weeks. This road has cost about
S12.00Q a mile or twice as much as the
same construction would figure up at
home. On the line there is one 500-foot
trestle and a 24-foot drawbridge. The
projected read is an enterprise of much
greater magnitude. It will run from Port
Clarence to Golovin Bay and will open
up the vast mineral belt In the interior
back of Nome. New York and London
capitalists are said to be backing the
project.
Another enterprise of considerable mag
nitude Is the construction <".f an army
rirst at the mouth of the Nome River.
The work is under the charge of Major !
Van Orsdale. It is rapidly approaching I
completion, and when finished will b*Â» ;
able to furnish accommodation for about j
fcnlf a repiment. thoush only two compa- ]
riee. â¢will bo stationed there during the
coming winter.
Good reports are coming In from all
the mining districts along the coast, but
that is about all that is coming in. Many
of these are startel by boomers, who
have something to sell, though here and
theie some real strikes have been made
The country is undoubtedly rich, but has
not yet even commenced to develop, nor
will it until tht- miner3 get water to work
with.
Sanitary Conditions Better.
Disease has considerably decreased, in
fzrt it h2s been almost eradicated. Small
pox may now be considered a thing of the
past, and the quarantine which has so
long encompassed us has now been

NOME'S POPULATION
IS FAST DECREASING
Chief of Police Sullivan has detailed De
tective Crockett to thoroughly investi
gate the conduct of the jury In the Henry
Schwartz pool-selling case, and after re
ceiving his report the Chief will decide
whether he will take the matter before
the Grand Jury. "There is something
wrong." said the Chief yesterday, "and
I am determined to find out just what
it Is, if at all possible."
"Baum," continued the Chief, "could not
give me any reason why he voted for an
acquittal after hearing the evidence,
which was not contradicted, and the law
as explained so pointedly to the Jury by
the Judge. He told me that he had asked
the Judge to be excused, as he was on a
panel in the Superior Court. It was a
curious excuse to make. I shall ask the
Judge about It."
Judge Cabaniss was seen yesterday af
ternoon, and said he could not say defi
nitely whether Baum had asked to be ex
cused, lie had a" faint recollection of one
of the jurors telling him that he was busy
and as the case would probably take a
long time he could not spare the time.
The excuse was not accepted, but the
Judge could not say whether or not Baum
was the man who gave it.
Bailiff Fleming, who served Baum with
the summons, said yesterday: "I am al
most positively certain that Baum did not
ask to be excused. After returning from
serving the summonses on the ten Jurors
1 met the Judge in the basement and we
went upstairs together to the court room,
entering througn the warrant clerk's
room. The Judge took his seat on the
bench and I dictated the names to him,
which he handed to the clerk. Dan Sul
livan was sitting beside the clerk, and
wrote the names on slips of paper. It
only took a minute or two, ana 1 looked
at my list to see that the names corre
ponded. Just as the clerk was placing
the slips in the ballot-box. Baum, whom
I had seen among a group of men at the
door of the court room, came in and took
a seat on a chair. He sat there until his
name was called, and went straight to
the jury-box. His was the thira name
called. I noticed him particularly, be
cause he had told me he would fool me
and would not serve on the jury, and
when he took "his seat on the chair he
sort of smiled at me â I suppose after what
he had said to me. I am certain none
of the ten asked to be excused, but I
recollect that two out of the previous fif
teen did so and were excused. I think
the Judge must have one of them in his
mind."
Chief Has Detailed Detective Crockett
to Make a Thorough Investi
gation of the Jury's
Conduct.
Told Chief Sullivan That He
Had Asked to Be
Excused.

MATCHES PLAYED ON THE
CALIFORNIA CLUB COURTS
CHAPTER I.
THE MAN FROM PIKE
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 11.â He had
come from Pike County, Mis
souri, to the land of flowers,
fruit and sunshine. When he
came to Rincon Valley, that lies
just two miles as the crow flies
from Santa Rosa, he decided that the val
ley was Just about what he had been look
ing for, and there he pitched his tent on
five acres of ground that made an ordi
nary farmer look tired. But the Pike
County man was chock full of ideas, and
he intended to make that five acres "blos
som as the rose."
John W. Keithley was the Missourian's
name, and he was not born yesterday.
CHAPTER II.
THE BUFFALO DOG,
Thereby hangs a tale relating to the
"Buffalo dog." Now "Buffalo dogs," be it
explained, is the name given by Rancher
Keithley to a variety of canines regard
less of breeed, whose shoulder develop
ment is abnormal. It means the typiflca
tion in a dog of the peculiar physical de
velopment affected by Pugilist Fitzsim
mons. A brute thus constituted naturally
has considerable horsepower in its shoul
ders.
When the Missourian bought the little j
five-acre "patch" the natives eyed him |
askance. When they could no longer con
tain their curiosity they plied him with
questions, but to little avail.
"You all keep on your sunbonnets," he
remarked facetiously, "an' I reckon I kin
snow you which shank of a razzerback
hawg comes nearest to havin' fat on it."
He built near his dwelling an outbuild
ing which looked like a barn, but its
ground floor was laid out in stalls hardly
large enough to house Shetland ponies.
Then he planted an acre of his holdings
to strawberries. "That fellow's nutty."
remarked Neighbor Wellington. "Those |
vines '11 need water the year "round, and j
even if he had some way of irrigating \
thorn it would cost more than the crops
will bring. I sort o' feel sorry for him."
"And them's my sentiments, tew,"
echoed the valley.
But in the flat lowlands where lles\
Keithley's taxable realty there is water
anywhere at a depth of ten feet. The
cost of irrigation comes not from a lack
of water, but from the need of bringing
it up from the subterranean storehouses.
CHAPTER III.
LIGHT ON THE MYSTERY.
Rancher Keithley having planted his
strawberries and dug canals between thÂ»
rows of vines, then sunk several wells at
various points in the "patch." Into each
of these he placed a simple home-made
pump, operated by means of a drive
wheel of peculiar construction, about six
feet in diameter and hollow in the cen
ter. The neighbors wondered if he in
tended to utilize a horse for each wheel,
and continued to shake their heads sor
rowfully. At last the Pike County man's
preparations were complete and his se
cret came out.
One morning he led from the mysterious
outbuilding a pair of "buffalo dogs," each
of which was driven on to one of the
wheels. The neighbors, in anticipation of
"some doings," had gathered in num
bers. The dogs in the wheels began to
get restless, and as they moved the
wheels began to turn. There followed
such frantic contortions and such a bed-
lam of "ki-yis" that the Missourian was
glad to invoke the aid of his exultant
neighbors to stop the wheels and bring
peace and comfort to the canine heart.
Rancher Wellington lost a couple of sus
pender buttons in laughing, and the Mis
sourian was subjected to a torrent of ag
gravating comments from the others.
"Boys, I admit it's a hoss on me: but
'never say die until you're dead' is my
motto, and if you'll come around at this
time to-morrow you'll be snortin' out
t'other side o' your faces."
CHAPTER IV.
TRIUMPH OF GENIUS.
Again it was morning, and again gath
ered the ranchers, gleefully, to "laugh and
grow fat." Rancher Keithley stroked his
buffalo' dogs and winked the other eye.
The dogs were driven on to the mills,
when, lo, and behold! the wheels began to
spin so the spokes were invisible.
Silence deep and profound, then
"Jumpin' Jehosaphatl" . came a voice,
choking with wonder, "how d" you do It.
Keithley?"
And Keithley, swelling with pride,
winked the other eye.
CHAPTER V.
REVELATION!
For fifteen minutes the dogs kept up
their whirlwind race, and finally exhaus
tion compelled them to stop. Then the
cause of all their energy was discovered
Suspended In each wheel, in such manner
that It would remain stationary, a foot
or two from the dog's nose, was a dead
rabbit.
That was all there was to itâ the dogs
did the rest.
That is why buffalo dogs are In demand
in Rincon Valley, and why the strawber
ries of the man from Pike are big as
peaches and as luscious as a watermelon.
Being a True and Humorous Tale in Five Chapters.

OR A WATER-WHEEL MYSTERY
Target shooters of all kinds were out In

The Californias were unfortunate from
the start, Sloman being caught off Harold
Ward's first ball, and L. Schroeder mak
ing only two runs. W. H. Howard 27, and
W. Reed 17, were the only batsmen who
scored double figures. Saunders bowled
most successfully, capturing five wickets
for eleven runs. The innings closed lor
54, leaving the Alamedas winners by 66
runs. The full details are given below.
The Alameda and California cricketers
met yesterday for the fourth time this
season on the Webster-street grounds,
Alameda. The California team was much
weakened by the absence of Arthur Dick
enson, who is a tower of strength both
with the bat and the ball. Alameda went
to the bat first with F. Croll and B. Bird,
the former of whom made 15. while the
latter compiled 43 before he was caught
by Guild. R. B. Hogrue scored 20 runs.
The total for the Innings was 120. Guild
and Howard did all the bowling for the
Californias, the former taking five wickets
and the latter capturing four.

proper swat came at last and Jay Hughes
took three sacks on It. Beyond the flag
l"ole the ball rolled â one of those swift,
!'>ng drives that show an affection for
ftnees. Then Hanlon came to the bat and
Hughes was lodged safely on the benches.
The Dudts behaved like well-mannered
tossers. They forgot their Beau Brum
mcl air at times and really surprised
thercsfclves into action. What they might !
have done had the affliction of fear of j
Mr. Hughes not sat upon them is food |
for speculation. At any rate, they gave i
Mr. Borcbers a fair support, not political, '
which their manager, Mr. Ewing, is busily j
fostering these days, but the real dia
xnor.d variety.
The game was a battle of slab perform
ers. The champion twirler of the cham- ]
pions brought his well ami to the contest, '
and he ust-d it unerringly. For the mat- I
ter of that 'â¢Chief Borchers displayed j
few paralytic arm muscles. But seven
limes were his whizzing curves unrolled,
and it was only In the eighth that a
bunch of hits was registered against him I
a.nd this bunch consisted of but two. j
â¢Champ" Jay was hit but six timesâ all j
scattered.
Oakland's new baseball players per
formed in less heartrending style yester
day, a'l save Weed on the third sack. The
oombined errors of the Dudes fall upon
the shoulders of this young guardian of
the l*-ft inlield. It may have been due to
diamond fxisht and it may not. The more
rational explanation reflects upon Cal
Ewing's managerial ability.
The runs were scored in the first inning
by a few Dudes finding the sphere â Ltren
naa and Arreilancs doing the stick work.
The lirst named scored. In the fifth the
Senators shot Mclaughlin (tt*sr the plate i
because Brummel Weed, forgettine that i
he was on earth, threw the ball at the ris- |
Ing moos, when first base was his mark. |
McLaugblln took three bases on the ef- I
furt and scored later on a slow hit over <
third by Devercaux. The score is:

STOCKTON. Aug. 12.â Uncle Henry'n
aggregation of pretzel-eaters played havoc
with Mr. Whalen of Stockton to-day and
by some timely hitting added another vic
tory to their long list.
From the fourth to the eighth Inning
the game was four all, and then the
microbes of the sloughs began working
In the mits of the Millers. Bunched errors
In artistic profusion by Harper's men and
a bunch or two of hits by the German
Equad gave the scorer enough work for a
series of games. The crowu was looking
lor a prolonged match, but this outburst
and red-lire display settled the diamond
struggle then and there.
The work of the visitors was concen
trated in two innings, the fourth and the
eighth. Around the bases the Hanksmen
flew to slow Stockton music, lburg was
on the slab tor the visitors and pitched
ball that was a shade or two too involved
for the curve-untwisters of Stockton.
Only McGucken, Streib and Whalen were
free from baseball improprieties, every
other member on the team having an error
registered against him. The score:

MORNING GAME
Sacramento 8, Oakland 4.
The game at Oakland yesterday morn
ing was thrilling during a few innings and
quiet and unobtrusive during the rest of
them. Moskiman, who was on the slab
for the Dudes, was found for the un
lucky number. Devereaux twirled for the
Senators and he was none too good.
In the fifth Sacramento found Mos
kiman for tlve hits, sending as raanv men
over the rubbor. In the eighth Dever
eaux was untwisted for three hits, which
combined with an error gave Oakland a
bunch of four runs.
One feature of the pame was a series of
double plays, which atoned for the num
ber of infield errors. The 6enators were
playing in all sorts of strange positions,
and the Fame thine was true of the
LÂ»udes. The score Is:

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 12.â A large whale In search of new worlds to conquer
came blowing and rolling through Raccoon Straits about 4 o'clock this
afternoon with the outgoing tide. While he was In the straits he kept a
lot of small boats on the jump. The whale evidently thought khat Stone's
yacht, the Presto, was a pilot boat, and he frightened the crew by chasing
around her as she sped home down the straits. He finally crossed to the
Tlburon wharf, where he compelled a hundred fishermen to pull In their lines
Not llkins the vicinity of the inhospitable wharf Mr. Whale turned hia prow
in the direction of the Corinthian Yacht Club cove, which was filled with
boats and arks of all sizes. The whale here did a splendid stunt He started
after a small boat in which were Dudley Dean, Benjamin Dean, Raloh
Chick and R. A. Dean of the Sierra Lumber Company. The occupants thought
their hour had come. The whale came up within four feet of their boat sev
eral times and once nearly drowned the rowers with spray he blew in the air
By hard rowing they reached the shore. . '
The whale then went diving among the yachts and the kelp beds that
cover the bottom of the cove. One Tiburon humorist said he was searching
for large anchors. It is not known whether he found any or not but more
than one boat owner is out his little barrel buoy and the whale is supposed to
be in an equal number. After disporting himself for more than half an hour
in the cove the whale Btruck out in disgust past Belvedere Point? whteh he
Eide-Bt^pped in good styic. and stood off Jn the direction of Fort Point
During the whale's occupancy of the cove Sam McDonough stood on his
Bunches of Hits by the Ger
mans and Stockton Er

consisted in Knowing one's self. He held
that self-knowledge is the essence of
all practical knowledge, which puts us
on a higher plane and qualifies men to be
socialists. By knowing ourselves we are
able to solve all economic and social prob

of salvation as worked out for us by God

The same sulky brute which dumped
Officers Potter and Crackborn into a ditch
at the Six-Mile House Â¦when the shorty
pair were bent on their vacation came In
for a thorough beating yesterday at the
hands of John Buckley, a young Califor
nlan aged 23 years. Buckley had hired
the sulky brute from Sam Gilmore, at
Twelfth and Mission streets, on last Fri
day for the purpose of going camping at
Point Pedro. On the return home the
horse refused to move, and Buckley used
a long ptrap, to which a good-sized buckle
was* attached. With this for a whip he
belabored the onimal in such a manner as
to peel the skin off Its legs at every
stroke. Officer J. A. Hayes of the Seven

placed Buckley under arrest on the charge

STORY OF A VIRGINIA MAID.
Mary Ball, "Washington's Mother, as
a Nurse Won a Husband.
Mary Ball, who afterward became the
mother of Washington, was born early in
the eighteenth century, her parents hav
ing emigrated to this country from Eng-
Uid only a few years previously. Her
girlhood was not materially different from
that of the average pioneer child in the
wilderness, and spinning and the other
arts which she learned were such as were
acquired also by her playmates. The mar
riage of Miss Ball to Augustine Washing
ton attracted not a little attention in the
country-side for two reasonsâ the age of
the bride and the fact that the groom
was a widower. Ii those days marriages
Â¦were usually contracted when .the girls
were mere children and a bride of 24 was
naturally looked upon as an exception to
custom. The" engagement of Mary and
Augustine was of short duration and the
spring wedding which followed was one
of the events of the year in Virginia so
cial life. There was no bridal tour, but
instead the young couple journeyed to the
estate of the brlaegroom, which enjoyed
the distinction of being the largest planta
tion in Westmoreland County.
I: is only fair, of course, to presume
that the bride was beautiful, but we have
also the authority for it of an old letter,
the writer of which designates her as the
"comeliest maiden" she knows, and grows

The election marked the turn of the tide.
The war was quickly brought to an end.
In the midst of the rejoicings over thÂ«
conclusion of terms of peace, on tne lotn
of April. 15Â©. the wise and strong hand
of President Lincoln waa withdrawn from
the heim of State by the act of an assaa-
Iowa College. â¢
The President early adopted a settled
and logical theory respecting the status
of the seceded States. Refusing to admit
the possibility of the withdrawal of any
State from the Federal Union, he main
tained that the State governments had
been overturned by the act of secession.
He therefore felt himself bound to recog
nize the equal rights In the Union of all
States or parts of States which returned
to their allegiance and to see to It that
regular legal governments Â¦were set up in
them as soon as conditions permitted. As
early as December. 1863. a proclamation of
amnesty was made, offering most liberal
terms to those who would take the^ oath
to support the constitution of the United
States, with the exception of certain pe
culiarly guilty classes, and it was pro
vided that whenever In any of the dis
loyal States one-tenth of the voters by
the census of 1S60, having taken the oath,
should set up a State government In ac
cordance with the constitution, such gov
ernment should be recognized by the
President, leaving Congress to pass upon

posed to take the view that the States
which had attempted secession had by
that act divested themselves of the rights

were rather In the condition of Territories

Party Readjustment.
The first shot fired at the flag floating
from the ramparts of Fort Sumter, In
Charleston harbor, roused the North from
Its lethargy and united the people in a
passion of resentment and patriotic devo
tion as years of argument cou'.d never
have done. For the moment party lines
were effaced. The clamor for putting
down armed rebellion by force of arms
Â¦was loudest of all from the Democrats.
Led by Douglas, whose earnest, wnole
hearted loyalty to his country in mis hour
of her need did much to atone for past
errors, the war Democrats, aa they were
termed, were practically absorbed into
the Republican party along with what
remained of the Americana and Freesoil
ers. There was a tendency to ignore par
ty names and unite all loyal forces In the
one great Union party.
President Lincoln in assuming the head
Of the Government had avowed his single
purpose to be to preserve the Union and
the constitution intact. No "minor mat
ter" was to be considered until the safety
of the nation was assured. To this policy
he held with inflexible purpose, but in a
conciliatory temper, in spite of pressure
from every quarter. The National Demo
cratic party, a mere fragment of its
former self, quickly gathered Itself to
gether, and as peace Democrats assumed
the critical functions of the party in op
position to the administration. They per
sistently opposed the prosecution of the
war, professing to adhere to the strict
construction views ot the constitution
which prevailed in the South, and deny
ing to the Federal Government any legal
power to coerce a State. Doubtless the
party served a useful purpose aa a re
straining influence, annoying and embar
rassing aa that Influence often was to the
Government. There were many who
looked with genuine concern upon the
conduct of a war by the party of loose
construction principles.
Even In the case of previous wars, when
the Democrats had been In power, consti
tutional authority r"id been repeatedly
subjected to severe strain, and there
seemed real danger lest the party of
broad constitutional interpretation should
wreck the foundation of the Government.
But there is no more strongly conserva
tive force than a keen sense of responsi
bility. Such a sense profound and solemn
ever controlled the President's action and
sobered the temper of the whole party.
Extra constitutional measures were ven
tured uBon. as the President and his ad
visers believed, only in obedience to the
sternest necessity. The constitution was
violated that the constitution might not
be utterly destroyed. As the war went
on the opposition of certain elements of
the peace Democracy became more viru
lent, and overt acts of resistance to Fed
eral authority were inspired if not actu
ally instigated by them. Serious riots in
defiance to the military conscription which
became needful occurred In New York
city In 1S63. In numerous instances the
Internal revenue law was deliberately and
persistently violated, and In a few cases
United States officers engaged in the en
forcement of the law were murdered.
Republicans gave various opprobrious
names to the Northern opponents of the
prosecution of the war. That which found
widest and longest favor was "copper
heads," which likened the closest foes of
the republic to the "snake In the grass,"
the venomous reptile In her very bosom
striking slyly and treacherously at the
nation's life. Â¦
TJivided, Counsels in the TJnion Party.
But the Republican or Union party was
not Itself a unit. There were those among

their cause and that Providence has itself
In a tragic and spectacular way called
upon the nation to strike the death blow
of the evil institution. These urged the
administration continually to aggressive
measures of emancipation, and the Presi
dent's steadfast adherence to his great
central purpose, regardless of factional
clamor, won him enemies among them.
Time has fully vindicated Lincoln's
calm strength, his wine moderation and
good sense. To the judgment of the more
radical leaders of opinion his attitude was
one of timidity and Irresolution. He
moved slowly when they would have
driven him swiftly toward the desired end.
Lincoln's quiet reserve of strength, his
patient waiting In the face of misunder
standing and the alienation of trusted
friends until he was assured that the
right moment for going forward had
come, were due In no small degree to his
intimate knowledge of the common, "plain
people" of the country. He knew. that he
must have their sympathy and support

most Interesting animaJs to be shown
there !s the highly-bred yearling Jersey
bull Prince David. This animal is a globe
trotter. It first saw the light on th* island
at Jersey, in the English Channel, and
was purchased there for A. B. Sprerkt-ls,
president of tne State Agricultural So

The animal !s one of the highest bred
Jersey bulls living and of the .most cor

Another interesting animal to be shown
nt th<Â» State Fair is the two-year-old
Hereford cow Armour Rose. She was
bred and owned in the famous Armour
herd, near Kansas City. Mo., and was pre
sented by Mr. Armour, as the best female
in hi? herd, to the convention committee
as his contribution toward defraying the
expenses of the national convention re
cently held there. She was exhibited in
Fhow windows In Kansas City and after

Herefords. She was purchased by John
Sparks of Reno, New, for $2500â the
largest sum ever paid at auction for a
Hereford. Mr. Sparks will send her, to
gether with other famous animals owned
by him, to Sacramento.
THE FESTIVITIES AT HIGHEST POINT.
The new Republican party entered upon
Its first administration under conditions,
as President Lincoln said, more difficult
than those which had confronted Wash
ington him3elf. While warlike prepara
tions had for months been going vigor
ously forward in the South, the North had
looked, calmly on, as if expecting the ex
citement to die away once more as In
former days. Probably neither party real
ly expected to come to blows, but the
South was fully determined to settle with
the North the status of slavery. Her
leaders were doubtless ready to dissolve
the Union if driven to extremes, but there
was among the people strong opposition
to secession, which was yet to be over
come by the progress of events. \
President Buchanan, while maintaining
the unconstitutionally of secession, was
unable to discover any constitutional
authority for coercing a sovereign State,
and weakly held his peace while the
power of the Federal Government
crumbled away before his eyes. The
whole military and civil service was dis
organized. Federal munitions of war and
all national possessions within the bound
aries of the retiring States were quietly
appropriated by them. Only Fortress
Monroe, the forts at Pensacola and Key
West and Fort Sumter at Charleston were
known them. When he saw that th!Â«
slowiy awakening but Irresistible force in
the national life was stirred at last then
he, too, was ready.
The policy of the administration was at
nrst one of exceeding caution In respect
to slavery. Those slaves who escaped to
tne Lnlon lines were surrendered to their
masters If the claim could be proved.
After a time fugitives were admitted to
service In the army. When General Fre
mont, commanding the Department of
Missouri, proclaimed the freedom of
the slaves of that State his order was
overruled by the President. But in Vir
ginia General Butler's more prudent ac
tion of accepting the slaveholder's view
of the negroes as "property," and there
fore liable to confiscation as "contraband
of war," was indorsed and a constant
stream of "contrabands" set in toward
the Union lines. By the end of 1S62. a year
of sad and serious reverses to the Union
arms, the times were ripe for the blow
which should encourage the downcast
friends of the Union and dishearten their
enemies and put them in the wrong be
fore the nations of the. civilized world.
January 1, 1S63. President Lincoln Issued
his emancipation proclamation, by which
all slaves within that portion of the coun
try then in rebellion were declared â¢ free.
This had been preceded three months be
fore by a proclamation addressed to the
seceded States warning them of the Pres
ident's purpose, in case they refused to
return to their allegiance, to proclaim the
freedom of their slaves. The emancipa
tion act was hailed with rejoicing by thÂ«
Northern abolitionists and received gen-

POLITICS OF THE CIVIL WAR PERIOD.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 12.
Henry P. Dalton will not be an inde
pendent candidate for Congress. This is
probably the most important development
of the post-election period.
"My statement issued last night and
that issued before the election mean Just
what they say*" said Henry P. Dalton
to-day. "The primaries are over, and the
people have expressed their wishes, and I
shall abide by that expression."
Whatever inclination Henry P. Dalton
may have had to run as an independent
candidate has been overcome by his friend
Dr. George C. Pardee. Mr. Dalton re
fused to make a statement last night until
very late, and this delay was believed to
mean that he would become an indepen
dent candidate, and when the statement
linally did come it was believed to be the
result of the efforts of Dr. Pardee to keep
him in the party harness.
Dr. Pardee has ambitions toward the
Governorship two years from now, and
the defeat of his friend the County Asses
sor will have a decided effect upon his
future as well as upon that of the County
Assessor. To have had Mr. Dalton run as
an independent candidate would have been
fatal to all ambitions upon that side.
The Democrats of Alameda County were
building great hopes upon the split that
was to be created in the Republican party.
They were ngunrig that County Assessor
Daiton. who lias never hesitated to run
as tn independent' candidate wnen it serv
ed his ends, would kick out of the harness
if he were defeated, and that he would
make an independent run. If that were
the case they ligured that a good Demo
czat would have had a possible chance lor
election and they had already selected
M. P. Tarpey of Alameda, National Com
mitteeman of the Democratic party from
tnis State.
This was one of the reasons why so
many Democrats were supporting Dalton
in his candidacy against Metcalf. In Ala
meda Thomas Stoddard, who Is one of the
henchmen of Tarpey, was out making
Dalton's tight, and all over Alameda
County Democrats were urging Dalton on
in the hope of splitting the Republican
party.
But Dalton has decided that he will not
be a candidate, and so the plans of thÂ©
Democrats have gone astray.
One of the cries made against Dalton
was that he was not a Republican, and
down in the First Ward a job was ar
ranged, but not carried through. It was
proposed to challenge Dalton's right to
vote upon the ground that he was not a
Republican and make him sign one of the
affidavits required as a test which pledge
a man to support not only McKinley and
Roosevelt, but the Republican nominee or
the Third Congressional District. By
forcing Dalton to sign this it was thought
that it would prevent his running as an
Independent. But the challenge was made
against Mr. Dalton's father and not
against the County Assessor himself
The vote of the election Saturday by
precincts is as follows:
FORTY-SIXTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT.
Details of the Vote That "Was Oast
at the Primaries Throughout
the County on Last
Hopes of the Democrats to
Elect a Congressman
Have Vanished.

Shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, while Richardson was In bed. he
heard somebody open the door of his room
John Richardson, a machinist, living at
235 Langton street, told a startling HLory
to the police last night of how he had
been forced to sign a promissory .note for
$100 at the point of a pistol. Richardson
some time ago engaged a middle-aged
woman to keep house for him. Recently,
he claims, he had a growing suspicion
that'she was not attending to business,
and he decided to dispense with her ser
vices. On' learning of his intentions, he
Bays, she went to him and pleaded "with
him not to discharge her. She promised
to do better in the future, and on this con
dition he decided to retain her.
John Richardson's Story of
Midnight Crime Told
to Police.
COMPELLED TO
SIGN NOTE AT
PISTOL POUT
Last evening Richardson visited police
headquarters and told his tale of woe
to Captain of Detectives Seymour.
Richardson doubts whether he will be
able to identify the stranger, even if he
is arrested, i He says : he wore a dark
slouch hat which -was pulled down over
his eyes, partly concealing his face. He
Is particularly anxious that the police
arrest the woman, as he strongly believes
that she Is the main conspirator.
After returning to his house Richardson
round a half written promissory note
lying on the table and covered by a news
paper He believes that the strangers
Intended to compel him to sign- this one
in conjunction with the other, but at the
last moment. he decided not to.
Captain Seymour at once detailed two
of his best men on the case with Instruc
tions to do all In their power to land the
stranger and the woman. â¢ '
The stranger then started for the door,
and as he noiselessly walked downstairs
Richardson started after him, intending
to compel him to-give him the paper. As
he grabbed himj. by. the arm the man
thrust his revolver in his face and order
ed him back into his room.
"You can't * get away from me," de
clared Richardson. ? "Give me the note
or I'll call a policeman."
Tho stranger, after releasing his arm
from Richardson's grasp, struck him a
light blow on the side of the head with
the pistol and ran from the scene. Real
izing the foolishness of following him,
Richardson contlned his efforts to find
ing a policeman.
Meeting a patrolman on Harrison
street, the machinist told him what had
happened. Accompanied by Richardson,
the policeman went to the latter's homo,
intending to Interview the woman, but
she had fled.
With trembling hand Richardson says
he took the pen that was proffered him,
and wrote his signature to the note. Dur
ing all this time the stranger kept his re
volver trained on him, frequently threat
ening to "blow his head off" if he made
any move. After the note was signed the
armed visitor , examined â¢ the signature,
and, after placing the document in his
pocket, cautioned Richardson not to
report the occurrence to the police under
penalty of being made a subject for the
Coroner.
The stranger instantly drew a revolver,
and, pointing it at Richardson, ordered
him to keep quiet. Just then, the machin
ist says, the woman appeared, and, pro
ducing a promissory note for $100, com
manded him to sign it
"Take your time about it," the woman
declared, according to Richardson, "as
we do not want any dispute to arise over
the signature when we try to negotiate
the note."

ask<Â»d him what he wanted.

pital early yesterday morning by Police
man Cleu, where it was found that his
left leg was broken. The physician was
under the influence of liquor, and accused
the attaches of the hospital, individually
and collectively, bf stealing his gold
watch and chain.
Yesterday when he was sober McGovern
asked that the police be notified about the
theft of his watch and chain, and De
tective Dillon was detailed on the case.
The physician told the detective that the
last ealoon he recollected being In was at
the corner of Fourteenth and Valencia
streets. There he got into a row with
some men he thought were prize-fighters,
and he was punched In the face and
thrown out. He suspected the men of re

be valued at $75.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
VISIT THE PRESIDIO
The second of the course of lectures on
"Infidelity** was delivered by Benjamin
Fay Mills at Metropolitan Temple last
night before tho Ethical Institute. The
subject was, "Wh'j Are the Believers?"
"The believers," said Mr. Milts, "are not
only those who believe in any particular
faith, creed, dogma or doctrine, but those
who believe In nature, in the succession of
the seasons and in the ultimate good
â¢which may be accomplished by indi
viduals. Those who believe in these
things and in their continuance for some
good purpose have faithâ the highest,
jiol-le^t and erreatest faith. It Is a greater
and nobler faith than the belief in any
particular events alleged to have occur
red in the past or in any particular ordi
nances imposed by revelation upon man
kind. Those believers are everywhere,
amonjr all peoples, none of them perfect,
but all in various Stages of perfection."
"Who Are BelieversP"'
The feature of the affair which lends
it an air of mystery is the reticence
of the dwellers in No. 623. When a
Call reporter visited that place
last night he was told that nothing un
usual had taken place on Friday night.
That any shooting had occurred was em
phatically denied. Yet Miss Nettle Hrnne'
and Mrs. Henne both assert positively
that from No. 623 the shots came,
and from the front door bearing that num.
A Mysterious Silence.
The portion of Fillmore street in which
the mysterious shooting occurred is thick
ly populated. On the southeast corner of
the five lrundred block is the Sacred Heart
Church. On the northwest corner of the
block below Hayes Is the Convent of the
Holy Family. All round are fine resi
dences.
Fogarty then went to the house of Wil
liam J. Mulcahy, a janitor in the City
Hall, to compare notes in the night's
happenings. Mulcahy had heard nothing
but had noticed the trail of blood.
From Fell street to Hayes on the east
sidewalk of Fillmore, the course Mrs.
Henne declared that the man had taken,
was a thick trail of blood. It ran as far
as the center of Hayes street. There all
trace ended. So well defined was the
bloody trail that oven yesterday it was
still plainly discernible.
Next morning John Henne told John T.
Fograrty, of the Royal and Queen Insur
ance Company, who lives at 606 Fillmoro
street, of tho night's happenings. Fo
garty and he then went out together to
look at the course the mysterious man
was said to have taken.
other shot followed; then there was a
crash, and a woman's voice cried, "Put
the light up, will you?" \
The two frightened women then saw. so
they say, a man, bundled up in a long
black overcoat, stagger out of the front
door of 623 Fillmore street. When ho
gained the sidewalk he made his way up
Fillmore street as far as Fell, then came
across on to the other side of the 1 street
and went down Fillmore in the direction
of Hayes. Mrs. and Miss Henne watched
the man across Fillmore again. Then, as
he passed ,by the Convent of the Holy
Family, they lost sight of him. As all.
then remained quiet they returned to beJ.
The house of mystery. No. 623, 13
owned by. a man named Ullenthal, at
present in the country. On' Thursday
night, the night before the shooting, the
place, which had been unoccupied for
some months, received new tenants. They
moved In at dusk, and their few' modest
possessions, of which a piano was the
chief, were contained In one express
wagon:- . ' .. -
"The flat was unfurnished." explained
Miss; Henne, "and the new .tenants
brought very little furniture. I don't
know what a burglar could want there."
.William J. Mulcahy told of the crimson
trail along the sidewalk. "It was as dis
tinct as possible," he said. "There was no
possibility of its being paint or anything
else. It was blood. I think the police
should be informed of the affair."
John T. Fogarty declined to â¢ say any
thing about the affair. "Go over to 623."
he said; "they can tell you there. I don't
want to bo bothered. Yea, I saw the
blood. "We all did."
ber staggered the man who left the trail
of blood which all the neighborhood has
seen and puzzled over.
"It was about half, past 2 on Friday
morning," said Nettle Hennie last night,
"that grandmama awakened me. She
called me to her window and told me that
there had been some Bhootlng in 623. We
both stood at the window for a few sec
onds. Nothing happened and we were
about to retire again when we both were
brought to the window again by a terrible
scream. Then came- a sharp report like
that of a- revolver and a woman cried,
"Put that light up." Almost at the same
time a man In a long black overcoat stag
gered out^of ;the door of 623.
"The nwon showed every object up
clear as daylight. He wore a slouch hat
and had, 1 think, a beard, though it may
have been the shadow. He ran up the op
posite sidewalk to Fell street. There he
crossed over to our side and ran down to
ward Hayes. He crossed Hayes and In
the shadow of the convent we lost sight
of him. I called my brother and my
father, but after a brief consultation we
decided to do nothing till morning. It was
clear moonlight, bright as day. I could
not be mistaken as tcnthe occurrences of
Friday night." -j
Heard a Piercing Scream.
Hardly had they taken their eyes off the
house when a piercing scream brought
them to the window again. An-
Plan Showing the "House of Mystery" and the Course Taken by the Unknown.
Number 605 Is the house from which Miss Henne watched on the night of August 10 after she had been awakened
by shooting. Number 623 is the "House of Mystery." Dotted line indicates tracks.
THREE pistol shots heard
shortly before dawn on
Friday last, followed by
a woman's scream of terror or
supplication, and next morn
ing a trail of blood from the
house -whence the startling
sounds apparently came, have
caused the wildest excitement
and surmise among the resi
dents on Fillmore street, be
tween Hayes and Fell. Two
credible witnesses saw a man
stag-ger out of a house, but
this is the only light on the
Western Addition mystery.
On Friday morning last, shortly after
2 o'clock, Mrs. John Henne. who resides at
608 Fill more street, was awakened by two
shots fired In rapid successon somewhere
outside. She went to her window and
drew up the shade, but saw nothing. Still
thinking, however, that her ears had not
played her false and that she had ac
tually heard shots she roused her grand
daughter. Miss Nettie Henne, who slept
in the next room, and telling her of the
startling sounds which had awakened her
called her to the window. There was a
bright moon and every object showed
clearly. The two women stood looking at
C23 Fillmore street, the hou6e opposite
theirs, from which they believed the
shots had emanated, but as all remained
quiet they turned away again.

Hoots and Yells for the
Directors Who Advocated
Alteration.
â¢
Stormy Meeting Ends in Wild Stam
pede to Signify Disapproval of
French. Hospital's Board
of Trustees.
Stormy words " flew and confusion
reigned at the meeting of the French
Benevolent Association held at Native
Sons' Hall yesterday afternoon. The meet
lr.g was called by the board of directors of
the French Hospital to consider the ad
visability of constructing extensive Im
provements and ait.era.Uons In that Insti
tution. About 60u men assembled In the
old hall and demonstrated their disapprov
al of the directors' plans by hoots, yells
and making "rough house" generally. The
lie was freely passed and members whose
sentiments diu not meet with the approv
al of the meeting were howled down.
Finally the question whether the Im
provements ebould be made was put to
the assembly. â¢
"Those who disapprove move to the
right of the hall," cried President R.
Chartrey. __,. ,, . .
The entire meeting with wild yells, hats
hoisted on car.es and waving handker
chiefs lined themselves in a solid mass
as near the right hand wall aÂ« they could
get. "It will be unnecessary to count
votes," eaid Chartrey. . dryly. Three
small boys who didn't understand French
Â¦were the* cnly ones left.
When the meeting was called to order
Chartrey told his audience that they were
there to" discuss how the $25,000 set aside
Â¦for repairs on the hospital. was to be used.
Howls of derision greeted him.
"The negotiations with the contractors
have been already entered into," he said.
"Are they signed?" cried some one. "No."
Â¦was the reply.
Then Editor E. Gostleux sprang to his
feet. "Oh, no; they're not signed," he
cried. "I saw the signatures on the con
tract, but they're not signed."
"Liar:" came from the platform, and for
a moment It looked like a session of the
French Chamber of Deputies.
Gostieux asked the members how they
â¢ucre to provide for the sick if all the
;no>:ff was tr-trt on alteration.*?
"We have the finest hospital in the city:
â¢we must keep adding to it or it will soon
be but a second rate one," said Chartrey
a.-; suon as he could make himself heard
above the applause Gostleux's speech had
excited.
"Vote: Vote!" cried the crowd in the
hall. â¢
"The question Is not what kind of
alterations are we to have, but are we to
have them at all or no?" shouted Alex
ander HergeroL
"Yee! Yes! that's r'ght. No improve
ments!" yelled the metting.
.. The directors emlled diplomatically.
â¢Chartrey rost to put the question. Then
came the stampede. It Is evident that the
French Hospital will remain as it is for
a while.

painting, and all the way through.- But
tho mill work may be done in New York
or Stillwater or Grand Rapids, where ten
hours is a day's labor. Outside mills are
direct competitors with us. and that is
why we contend that there is no injustice
in maintaining a nine-hour day though all
the other building trades have the eight
hour day. The unions refuse to protect
us against even the competition of mills
in the California lumber regions because
it is too big a proposition for them to
handle. In consequence we must either
maintain our present footing or get out
of the business."
"The fight against our demand. J. J.
Williams, secretary of the Mlllmen s
Union, said to a Call representative, 'is
being made principally, by C. A. Hooper
& Co. Now Hooper has had the advan
tage of the other millowners for the last
twelve years by 12W. per cent. He has
worked his men ten hours as against nine
hours in most of the other mills. He has
had other advantages over them through
the general lumber business. Yet they
have survived that competition. We be
lieve they will be better off if put on an
equal footing here by a uniform eight
nour day, and It Is only Justice to the
worklngmen that we are demanding.
In four San Francisco mills and in all
of the Oakland mills the union men were
paid off Saturday night after their re
fusal to return this morning under the
old schedule, and were ordered to remove
their tools from tne mills. In a number
of others they were notified to appear at
the usual time this morning for work, or
else to call at 10 o'clock to receive the
wages due them for last week's work,
and to remove their tools. Still other own
ers were content to Vait until this morn
ing, giving no notice to the men supple
mental to the answer made by their as
sociation to the Building Trades Council.
"Unless some understanding is reached
before the end of the week." Andrew Wll
kie, proprietor of the Mechanics' Mill,
said yesterday afternoon, "I believe build
ing will practically cease in San Francisco
and the bay cities, and the 15,000 men in
the building trades will be thrown out
of employment. Builders will simply de
cline to undertake new work until the
trouble is adjusted. They will not be able
to get mill work from us or from outside
mills because the unions will refuse to
handle the material. Building cannot pro
ceed without the mil? work, and all of the
trades concerned will be tied up. This, too,
in the best season of the year.
"There Is no personal feeling between
the millmen and the millowners in this
contest, so far as I know. Nearly all of
the owners would be glad to see the eight
hour day in force, but when we figure it
up and find the balance on the wrong side
of the ledser we .would be madmen to
grant the demand of the union.
The millowners will meet to-night. The
meeting will be a Joint session of the San
Francisco Planlng-mill Association, the
San Mateo Planing-mlll Assocation and
the Oakland Planlng-mill Association. It
will probably be decided then whether the
mills shall try to continue operations with
non-union men or shall adopt the other
policy of closing down until an adjust
ment is effected.
The non-union phase of the question
just now Is commanding most attention
In both camps. Should the millowners be
able to continue operations with the' help
of the few non-union : men in the mills,
supplemented by unemployed mlllmen
now in the city or non-union men se
cured from the outside, the contest will
at once assume bitter features. If the
mills are compelled to close down for lack
of laborers the effects of the contest will
be been mainly in the negation of opera
tions in the Dulldlng trades. In either
case It is conceded that if a settlement
is not effected within two weeks at most
the building- trades will be tied up, either
through strikes or walkouts of the union
men to prevent the use of mill work pro
duced by non-union men, or by -.the re
fusal of contractors to undertake new
work.
The executive committee of the Build
ing Trades Council, which is directing
the millmen's light for the eight-hour day.
will go into session at 8 o'clock this morn
ing, and will receive reports from men
employed In the various mills. In case
non-union men continue work in any of
them efforts will be made to induce them
to join the union, or at least not to Jeop
ardize the cause of their fellow working
men by working under the nine or ten
hour schedule. The leaders say that no
violence or intimidation whatever will
be used. â¢
Mlllmen and millowners are waiting
somewhat nervously for developments
thajt to-day will bring forth. The work
ingmen no longer expect any of the bosses
to weaken and let the men go to work
under an eight-hour rule, and few of the
owners expect more than a corporal's
guard of the employes to continue wont
ing under the old arrangement.
