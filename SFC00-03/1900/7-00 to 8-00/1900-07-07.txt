TIENTSIN; June 19 (via Chefu July 1
and Shanghai July I).â Those best In
formed in Tientsin consider the position
of tho foreigner* in Peking as almost
heiplerp. It Ifi hopeless to attempt to
force the way with the force available.
Commanders are willing to resort to des
j>^ratc means, but to attempt a forced
rnarch .from Tientsin with the forces at
Â¦hand means certain destruction to the
frrmy. besides the. slaughter of the civil
ians loft at Tientsin. Enough soldiers are

The water supply Is an important prob

The Chinese are committing' terrible
atrocities upon the wounded. They are
mutilating all the dead which fall into
their hands. General Tung Fuh Slang,

In the Chinese army, Mohammedans. Is
marching from the southwest toward Pe

palaco. The Mohammedans and Boxers
are fighting in Peking. Ten regiments of
General Nieh's command north of Tien
tsin arc reported to have deserted and
gone to pillaging the country. Residents
declare that a Chinese commune was in
augurated and the peaceful Chinese are
the greatest sufferers. The foreign \ sol
diers are burning the. outskirts of Peking
to deprive the enemy of shelter. ,The Box
ers are destroying outlying villages for
loot. The smoke of a hundred fires can
be seen In every direction.
Tientsin was not bombarded to-day, for
the first . time for a fortnight. Families
are returning to their homes for their pos
sessions. The women; and children will
be sent to Taku as soon as travel, Is safe.
No unfriendly Chinamen are visible In the
streels. A few of the richest, with, their
families, are huddled in the outhouses for
protection, badly ' frightened. OtherB,
concealed in various houses, shoot at the
Europeans on the streets. : The Chinese
dead about Tientsin number thousands.
Most of those who have been killed .; lie
unburied in the fields. The river to Taku
is full of floating bodies, and many have
been washed up by the tide. Dogs -are
feeding on these bodies along the banks.
The small American contingent " every

McCalla and Major, Waller are at Tien

of every movement by common consent^
LONDON, July 7, 2:40 a. m.â The Russian Government announces that it will sive Japan a free hand to apply mili
tary force in China. The terms of this consent are summarized in the subjoined dispatch from St. Petersburg,
unoVr date of July 6. In reply to an inquiry from the Japanese Cabinet regarding the dispatch of Japanese troops
to China to render aid to the foreigners in Peking. The Russian Government declared on .May 27 that It left the
Jnpanrsc Government full liberty of action in this connection, as the Toklo Cabinet expressed Its readiness to act
in full agreement with the other power?.
It is in consequence ot this, no doubt, that Japan is preparing to embark 20,000 more troops. Political considerations
â¢hat were thought to have been Influencing the action of the powers are thus laid aside for a moment, at least by the
Government * supposed to have the dearest purpose respecting China's future. Japan's sending of troops can have little
bearincon the CateÂ«t the forfisrners in Peking. .;- :- : -
Baron HayoshlJ the now Japanese Minister, who arrived in London on Friday, said that ten days would probably be
--Â«>qu!rr i d for tbe'caxryfns of troops to China. His dictated statements contained these, sentences:
"If all the conditions Japan has asked were conceded, I see no reason why Japan should not undertake the task
of Fuj>pros>;:r.;; the trouble. The powers are all agreed in wishing to put down the rebellion, but it does not seem that
ihcy or* 1 agreed on the moans."
From this authoritative utterance it is inferred that Japan does not name the conditions, and that the concert of the
powers is a Jittl* jangled. . _V_ ''
RUSSIA WILL GIVE JAPAN A FREE HAND.

der restraint.
The Chefu correspondent of the Express, telegraphing on Thursday, says there is no
longer any doubt that disaster has overtaken the Russian force of 3000 that left Tientsin for
Peking June 11. The Russians had a full field gun complement and carried their own trans
ports.
As nothing has been heard from them for twenty-four days "it is assumed t that they ; have
been overwhelmed. Trustworthy news is received to the effect that all the country to the north
cact of, Peking is covered with the corpses of men and horses of the western garrisons. Fight
ing of a desperate character took place in the immediate neighborhood of Tientsin on June 30.
Taku dispatches say an attack in great force is expected at any moment. The Chinese
commanders are awaiting the arrival of more guns and reinforcements before making an effort to
retake the city.
A dispatch from Shanghai to the Daily Telegraph, dated July 5, says the losses of the allies
une 29 totaled 600.
According to the Daily Telegraph's correspondent, in a dispatch dated Thursday, United
States Consul McWade has great influence with Li Hung Chang, and has persuaded him to issue
a proclamation containing detailed instructions to prefects, sub-prefects and magistrates. It or
ders them to detect, behead and otherwise severely punish Boxers. These officials, the proclama
tion says, will be held responsible for the safety of the missionaries and native Christians. The
Governors of two Quoungs join in the proclamation.
Another proclamation issued by Li Hung Chang directs that persons starting an uprising
shall be at once beheaded, and that those spreading false rumors shall be severely punished. This
latter phase, in a Chinese sense, means slow strangulation by means of a wooden collar. Whole
sale executions are expected to follow these proclamations. Official dispatches from Port Ar
thur to the Russian Government, bearing date of July 2, show that the country to rthe northward
is in a state of disturbance and that bands are destroying property. Six pirate ships "have been
captured by Russian naval vessels at the island of Elliong.
The Hamburg-American Steamship Company has placed at the disposal of Emperor Wil
liam their steamer Savonia, due at Hongkong to-day (Saturday), for use as a hospital ship for
China. The Emperor has accepted the offer with warm expressions of thanks.
A missionary who has returned to Berlin says that while in China he learned that hun
dreds of Mauser rifle? had been brought in in coffins supposed to contain the bodies of Chinese
who had died abroad.
A special dispatch from Shanghai, dated Friday, says the situation is becoming extremely
critical owing to lack of sufficient supplies, but only as a last resort will the town be evacuated in
favor of concentration of forces at Taku.
S0L.DIERS OF THE IMPERIAL CHINESE ARMY IN SUMMER UNI
FORMS.
From Collier's AVeekly.
LONDON. July 7, 3 a. m.â Details of further horrors in Peking gathered by corespond
ents at Shanghai from Chinese sources, especially of the slaughter in the Chinese and Tartar
city of thousands of native Christians, say that the capital reeks with carnage. The ruthless
thirst for blood is spreading in all of the northern provinces; and Av*herever there are native Chris
tians the scenes enacted in the capital are reproduced in miniature. From these provinces nothing
further comes regarding the legation forces-, except a repetition that they are all dead. The cor
respondents aver that if the Chinese officials in Shanghai wished to throw light on the real state
of affairs in the capital they could do so r and. therefore, the worst reports are accepted as true.
Prince Tuan's coup d'etat is described by the Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail
as a sequence to the grand council of Ministers, at which Yung Lu advocated the suppression
of the Boxers promptly. The Dowager Empress gave her whole support to Yung Lu, and a
scene of disorder ensued. Prince Tuan passionately intervened, backed by Kang Yih. They
rushed from the council and their partisans raised the cry "Down with the foreigners/' The effect
was electrical. The eunuichs, palace officials 'of all sorts and most of the populace took up th
cause of Prince Tuan, and his agents immediately put the Emperor and the Dowager Empress un-

LONDON, July 7.â The Dailly Telegraph publishes this dispatch from
its special correspondent: N
6ANTON, July 5 (via Hongkong, July 6-7)â Intense excitement
has been caused here by a dispatch from Sip Robert H'irt to the effect
that the British Legation fs in fames in Peking. Fears are entertained
that the foreign ministers have been massacred.
The entire French colony has fled irom TunÂ£ Chow The mission
station there has been converted into a little fort. The BoÂ£ue forts on
Canton River have been reinforced by oOOO viceregal soldiers. Viceroy
Li Hung Chang issued a proclamation this morning which r^Â«ds: **By
imperial, orders people and property are to be protected. Troubles be
tween-natives and native converts are to be prevented. Starters of any
uprising are to be at once beheaded. Those spreading fa se rumors will
be arrested and severely punished."
"Severely punished" means slow strangulation by the cangue.
Wholesale execution of Boxers, pirates and other criminals will surely
follow that proclamation.

Gentlemen of the convention, Illinois makes
no' exaggeration when ehe tells you that in
that great State the conditions are far better,
the prospectB are much brighter for Democracy
than in 1S02, whon our candidate for Vice
President carried it by 30,000 majority. (Ap
plause.) ,
We hÂ»ve a. State ticket stronger than we ever
had before. We have but one Democracy in
Illinois. We voice the sincere sentiment of the
Democracy in Illinois, from one end of that
State to the other, when we ask you to nom
inate the man whose name we shall present â
a man who nan been tried and found true to
the contest, with no weak spots In his armor,
a man whose character and ability recom
mend him to the people in .every part of this
republic; a man who possesses all the noble
attributes of a noble man, great enough and
good enough to be President of the United
States with a platform that reads like a Bi
ble, ond with these two faithful Democrats
standing together, shoulder to shoulder, we can
sweep criminal aggression and McKinley hy
pocrisy off the face of the earth.
Gentlemen of the convention, we now present
to you as the choice of the united Democracy
of our State that dlEtingulshed statesman, that
splendid, vigorous, reliable Democrat, ex-
Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson, of Illinois.
(Great and continued applause.) : .
Mr. Williams spoke rapidly and briefly,
and at his mention of Adlai Stevenon,
Illinois was on its feet cheering wildly.
Kansas was up. as was Alabama. Arkan
sas, Mississippi and a large number of
delegates In different parts of, the hall.
The applause, while vigorous, was short,
not lasting above a minute.
Towns's Name Presented.
When the. roll call reached Connecticut,
that State gave way to Minnesota amid
cheers and cries of "Towne." A. A.\Roes
sing of .Minnesota then took the platform
to present the name of Charles A. Town*
of his State. Â¦ , .
Mr. Roepsing is a tall man, with a voice
befitting his stalwart frame. He could be
heard in every direction. His .first- ap
plause was gained when lie spoke of- Mr.
Towne as a man who embodied the best
characteristics of American manhood.
When he pronounced the name of Towne
there was cheering from the Minnesota
delegation, which arose to Its feet," wav
ing flags in frantic fashion. -The galleries
Joined in the applause, but there was less
enthusiasm among the men upon the floor
who had the votes. A stout woman
climbed upon a chair waving a picture of
Bryan and Towne with her left hand,
while with her right' she waved a. hand
kerchief vigorously. Congressman Shaf
roth of Colorado, a zealous supporter of
the candidacy of Mr. Towne, climbed into
the gallery in an effort to get- the wo
man forward to the platform, but she de
clined to come.
j By degrees the enthusiasm spread
throughout the delegations and in a short
time men were up in the States of .Wyom
ing. Montana and South Dakota, but their
number was less than, that which, had
arisen to the name of Stevenson. :
Urged Hill to Accept
While- tho galleries were enthusing over
Towne, there was an excited little group
about the chair of Hill. In it was Cro
ker. "-Â¦Â¦"Â¦ â¢ Â¦ - Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦ Â¦â¢: Â¦Â¦ - ..

might decline, but "declines don't go," he
shouted. "New York's united and solid
seventy-two votes will be cast to the end
for David Bennett Hill." He continued:
The representatives of the Democratic party
of New York State recognize their responsibility
to the Democracy of the nation and believe they
appreciate the expectation of the Democracy
of the Union in the presentation of this hon
ored name. There is no State in the Union
with eo much to gain through Democratic suc
cess and 80 much to lose through Republican
triumph as the State of New York. We are
to elect this year not only the entire State
ticket, from Governor to State Engineer, not
only, as in every other State of the Union, every
member of Congress, but every member of our
State Senate and every member of the Assem
bly. Desirous of strengthening our hands at
home, we desire more to strengthen the na
tional ticket. And we stand here, seventy-two
as one, to pledge you the electoral vote of the
State of New York If David Bennett Hill shall
be the nominee of this convention for Vice
President. (Applause.)
This Is no idle sentiment. We believe that
David B. Hill, by the side of William J. Bryan
and standing upon the platform framed by this
convention, Is by thousands upon thousands of
votes the strongest man that can be named to
the Democracy of New York, New Jersey anil
Connecticut. He Is. not. nor has he been In
any senne a candidate for this nomination. He
has suggested any and every means which he
thought might bring about harmonious action
on the part of the delegation from the State of
New York and secure the electoral vote of that
State for our nominees. He may be pre
pared to decline the nomination which the dele
gates have_j>fTered to him ami now oresent to

Hill Declines the Honor.
Vv'e say to you, decline or not decline, from
the first to the last ballot in this convention
New York's ' seventy-two united, true-blue
Democratic votes will be cast for David B.
HUL '(Long continued applause and cheering.)
While Senator Hill, on the platform,
waited for quiet and for Senator Grady
to finish his speech he kept repeating "I
wlli -sot. take it." To Senator Grady he
said:
"This is absolutely unfair. You must
not do It." '
Judge Van Wyck kept urging him to
accept and not make a declination. Hill
was obduratr. His face was like marble,
his hand trembled and. he wiped the per
spiration from ; his brow.
â¢ While Grady ' was speaking Hill asked
to see Senator Jones, and, when the chair
man of the national committee came, the
ex-Governor said to him: >
"Jones, stop this thing. It is not wise.
It should not be forced upon me. Help
me stop it."
Chairman Jones said: "I will help you.
Go on and decline and I'll help you out.
I will see the delegation leaders. You are
right. 'Go 'on and make your, speech."
Then Senator Hill advanced to the plat
form. He stood with head bowed a few
minutes, expressive of gratitude for the
cheers that rolled in heavy volume to
ward him from every part of the hall,
and when finally there was a chance of hia
voice being heard he said:
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: (Great applause.) "While. I greatly, appr

York, ft Is proper for me to say that It Is with
out my approval. Â¦> (Cries of Â¦ "Xo, no.") I ap
preciate also the manifestations of friendliness
on the part of the delegates from ether States,
but I feel It IS. my : duty.', to Â¦ rise here and now
to i say - to you that : for : personal - reasons â and
good and valid reasonsâ I cannot accept this
"I cannot, I cannot," replied Hill, his
face white and set; "I do not want it.
"You must take it." said Croker, lean
ins over him, while Norman E. Mack and
Frank Campbell held Hill, one on each
side, and urged him to accept. An ex
cited man from New Jersey, ahaking his
lingers under Mr. Hill's nose, shouted:
"l'ou can't refuse, you can't. The party
must have you to save the Kast."
"I don't want it. You can nominate
Stevenson. He's as good as I am, said
Hill, and turning to Murphy. and Croker,
and gripping his hands, he said: "Please
don't force this, 'please don't."
Mr. Murphy, then gave an indication or
a prearranged scheme to nominate Hill by
saying to the excited New Jersey man :
"You keep quiet. It will be all right.
We have It fixed." Â¦ ; Â¦Â¦"Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦ 'â¢'-" *
. Meanwhilo the confusion continued to pe
so great in the hall that even after Chair
man Richardson had recognized Governor
Thomas of Colorado, to second the nomi
nation of Mr. Towne, not a word of his
speech could be heard by either the dele
gates or the people in the galleries.
Finally, after Governor Thomas had been
speaking for a minute or more, former
Senator White went to the platform and
in a ringing voice warned the convention
that if order were not restored, he would
move that the galleries be cleared.-
When the State of Delaware was called,
the announcement was made that tne
State would yield to New York. Then the
result^ or the Hill conference was appar
ent. A tremendous shout of applause
swept through the hall. Delegate Grady.
one of the leaders of Tammany Hall, had
already ascended the platform, and as
he stepped to the front to address the
convention the applause and cheering in
creased.
Grady Nominates Hill.
His first sentence rang . through the
great convention in trumpet tones:
"On behnlf of the Democracy Â¦ of. New
York I present to this convention for the
nomination of Tlce President the name
of David Bennett Hill." . ~v.
It was dramatic in the extreme. The
effect was electrical. His words set the
convention in a frenzy of enthusiasm. The
scone which followed was by far^the most
tempestuous of the session and tne name
of Hill echoed find re-echoed through the
hall. State . standards were seized and
helds aloft and the convention, hall was
filled' with fluttering flags. Delegates and
spectators cheered and the great struc
ture fairly shook with the noise when the
galleries became Infected with the en
thusiasm. , ,: , '
Governor Hill meantime had worked
his- way through the surging multitude
to. the platform. As he ascended it his
hands were eagerly, grasped and he -was
escorted to the seat' of the .^permanent
chairman.. He asked Mr. Grady to yield
that he might make a statement, but Mr.
Gmdy , declined. . .'

It was a pretty even a dramatic scene

Some Scenes at Kansas City Not Mentioned m the Dispatches.
HOW STEVENSON
' CARRIED THE DAY
the Closing Hours of the
Convention/
Scenes of Wild Disorder Mark
KANSAS CITY. July 6.â The final day's
Democratic convention broke clear and
hot. The sun blazed pitilessly down
through the same brilliant sky that has
marked every day of cenvention week ard
the cloudlces blue gave no promise of re
lief from the intense heat. But the grate
ful wind which has saved the week from
being intolerable did not forsake the
swslterlng crowds to-day. It blew steadily
from the southwestâ hot it is true, from
its passage over the plains, but neverthe
less a wind. It swept in through the
great windows at the south end of the
hall, fluttered the bunting and flags and
fanned the vast crowd!
An hour before the convention hall was
opened dense crowds were packed around
the various entrances and hundreds more
were coming on every thoroughfare that
afforded access to the . building. About
thirty minutes after the doors were
opened the galleries were all occupied and
still the crowds around the entrance and
in the streets had suffered no diminution.
Yesterday the hall was so densely
packed that it was at times impossible to
move around upon the floor; one-fourth
of the delegates were unable to see the
chairman and three-fourths of them could
hear nothing uttered from the platform.
The aisles were choked up to a degree
that was dangerous and passage through
them was at ail times diflicult and late in
the evening it was impossible. Both the
police and sergeant at arms started in
with great vigor to-day to prevent a repe
tition of the disagreeable features of yes
terday's session and for a considerable
time met success, but they were gradual
ly overwhelmed and made comparatively
helpless by the heavy crowds that were
allowed to pass by the gatekeepers.
The crowd waa not as boisterous as last
night, the great featuresâ the reading of
the platform and the nomination of a can
didate for Presidentâ being over.
Sulzer was the flr*t Vice Presidential
candidate to appear in the hall, and his
appearance seemed to excite very little
interest. He came down the aisles from
the delegates' door, coat thrown open, hat
jammed hard down on the back of his
head, his tall form towering over a
smaller delegate at his side, across whose
shoulders his arm was caressingly thrown
and into whose ear he talked with great
energy.
White Quells the Disorder.
At 10:40 a. m. Chairman Richardson ad
vanced to the front of the platform, a
great bouquet of sweet peas in his but
tonhole, and. with a sweep of his gavel,
cut off the strains of tne band, slowly
stilled the confusion and brought the con
vention to order for its third day's work.
But it wae some minutes before there was
enough quiet for the opening invocation,
and then the great audience arose while
the Rev. Rabbi Harry H. Mayer of Kan
sas City delivered a prayer, breathing the
etrnee of the itsponslbility resting upon
the convention.
Immediately following tho prayer the
call of the States began for the purpose of
making nominations for the Vice Presi
dency. Great confusion prevailed and very
few of the delegates were aware of what
was going on until Alabama and Arkansas
had been passed and California had been
called. Then the doughty form and florid
voice of Senator White emerged from the
Californians and in stentorian tones he
demanded to know what was going on and
that the aisles be cleared of the disorder
ly Intruders. When the chairman re
sponded that California was being called
for nominations. Senator White an
nounced that California yielded to Arkan
sas. "Arkansas yields to Illinois to place
in nomination Adlai E. Stevenson of Illi
nois.*' shouted Jefferson Davis, Demo
cratic candidate for Governor of Arkan
sas, standing on a chair, and raising a
cheer by his mention of Stevenson.
â¢ Now all business was suspended, as the
confusion had become so overpowering
that the call of the secretaries was in
audible above the roar. The police and
sergeants at arms struggled vainly to
suppress the mob which was well nigh in
possession of the floor. Men fought to re
tain their places and there were exciting
encounters which threatened to precipi
tate a tight under the eyes of the multi
tude.
Illinois Nominates Stevenson.
It took several minutes to restore some
semblance of order, and then the spokes
man for Illinois, Representative James
R. Williams, presented the name of Stev
enson.. He *said: . â¢
Â¦ Oentlemen of the Convention: Illinois Is
grateful to Arkansas for this evidence of her
regard. The united Democracy of Illinois de
sired to present to this convention for the
next Vice President of the United States, a
Democrat (cheers). One who <3r*w his first
hreath from the pure Democratic atmosphere
of old Kentucky (cheers). One baptized in thÂ«
great and Blowing Democracy of Illinois; one
who has stood squarely on every Democratic
platform since he became a voter; one who has
twi<-e represented in Congress a. district over
whelmlnrly Republican; one who Is . not a
rough rider but a swift rider (cheers); not o
warrior, but a statesman. A man who stands
for civil government ncalmt military rule; n
man who believes a Prrsldent of th<* United
States who Ignores the constitution, nÂ« the
present administration has dcr.e, must be one
who loves his or.n glory ' more than he doeÂ»
H20 rrnublic. A man who believes American
<Jep[>oti5in 1Â« no better than any other des
jiotisn:. A man who places his human blood
above human creed.. A man who will not
trade away the precious "Â¦> life of an American
Rcldlet for a nugset of gold in the Philippine
Islands. (Cheers.) A man who would, not
Irtve the 3000 or MOO brave American soldiers
whom MeKlnley has racrlflced In that hotbed
of dlneane und destruction for all the Inland*
In all the reas. (Applause.) ., A man who/dur
ing Jour, years of faithful administration as
Flirt Assistant Postmaster General of Â¦ the
United States, demonstrated to the country
tr.* he knows a Republican when hÂ« Bees one
in an office that belongs to a Democrat.
(Laughter and applause.) Nominate our . man
and you will not have to explain any speeches
made against Democracy, forhe has never made
any kind cr.Ix Democratic. (Applause.) A man
tic approval and again State standards
and banners were borne about the build
ing in tribute to the party nominee.
There are eentlemen here whose names have
been or will be presented to this convention.
any one of which names is stroneer than my
own. (Cries of "No. no.") There is no dif
ficulty whatever in making a satisfactory choice
and I ought not in Justice to tnem permit my
name to be used a single moment. This con
vention should proceed to name a candidate
from some of those who have been named. In
justice to me, in justice to them. In Justice to
the party, in justice to the ordinary procedure
of this convention, it is unfair to me to plare
me In this position without my consent.
(Great applause.)
He was frequently interrupted by pro
tests as he. insisted he could not accept.
From Nev York came cries of "Yes,"
"Yes. you can."
"When he sa*d, clearly and firmly, "I
did not come into this- convention as a
candidate; I did not expect to be a candi
date and I cannot accept the honor."
again came the cries of "Yes, you can,"
in greater volume than before: but they
had not the slightest effect. He left the
platform, cheered to tho echo and sur
rounded by his friends, who pressed for
ward to grasp his hand.
When Georgia was called Mr. Hutchin
son of that State, who spoke briefly and
clearly, delivered a short speech in sec
onding the nomination of Stevenson.
James Kennedy of Connecticut had
yielded tn Illinois in the rollcall and re
ceived a like favor from that State when
its name was called, and James Ken
nedy, chairman of the State delegation,
mane a. short seconding- speech for Ste
venson of Illinois.
Lewis' Name Presented.
When Idaho was called she gave way
to Washington, and W. H. Dunphy placed
In nomination the name of James Hamil
ton Lewis of Washington. The name of
Lewis was received with but feeble cheers
that lasted but a few moments. .
Indiana gave way to Virginia, and Con
gressman William A. Jones of the latter
State seconded the nomination of Steven
son. Iowa seconded the nomination of
Stevenson from the floor. Chairman Sells
of that delegation contenting himself with
the simple announcement. . Â¦
Kansas did not respond and at the call
of Kentucky there were cries of "Black
burn," but the Senator did not respond,
and ex-Governor McCreary of Kentucky
came forward and seconded the nomina
tion of Stevenson of Illinois,-; whom he
claimed as a son of Kentucky, he having
been born in that State.
Delegate E. E. McCaleb of Louisiana,
when that State was called, announced
from his seat that the delegation from
Louisiana unanimously seconded the
nomination of "that gifted leader and
statesman, David Bennett Hill of New
Again the name of Hill aroused the con
vention to cheering and applause.
Delegate A. Leo Knott of Maryland,
formerly an assistant Postmaster Gen
eral, presented in a brief speech the
name of Governor John Walter Smith of,
Maryland.
Massachusetts Seconds Towne.
When Massachusetts was called Hon.
George Fred Williams ascended the plat
form, amid considerable applause. In hia
address, delivered in clarion tones, car
rying to the uttermost parts of the hall,
he paid a handsome compliment to the
State of New York, which, he declared,
was unitedly in favor of the platform and
ticket of. this country. For this reason
no State in the Union was entitled to
greater consideration than New York.
This was received with a shout of ap
proval, the belief becoming prevalent In
some manner that Mr. Williams was
about to second Mr. Hill.
"The name which seems most desirable
In the interests of the party," Mr. Wil
liams declared, "Is that of a man who
is intellectually and morally the peer of
the candidate for first place, Charles A.
Towne."
â¢ Cordial applause was given to Mr.
"Towne. but it was tempered by the re
mark from one of the delegates: "We
want a Democrat; this is not a Populist
Convention," and other remarks that
raised in question Mr. Towne's Dcmoo
racy.
In response to these remarks Mr. Wil
liams insisted that Mr. .Towne was as
much of a Democrat as any. man in the
convention.
At the conclusion of the speech both
Williams and Towne were heartily
cheered.
Minnesota, when called, yielded the floor
to Mr. Cummings of Connecticut, who
briefly seconded the nomination of Towne.
His speech, as usual with those second
ing the nomination of Mr. Towne. was
received with much applause from the
galleries.
Senator Money of Mississippi arose
when his name was called and made his
way to the speaker's platform. He de
clared the ticket should be composed of
men both of whom had been Democrats
in every political affiliation. He, therefore,
seconded the nomination of Adlai E. Ste
venson.
The audience then received Governor
Stone of Missouri with great enthusiasm,
rising to its feet and cheering and wav
ing .flags, while the band played "Dixie."
When Tie spoke it was with deliberation
and he was given strict attention, par
ticularly by the local portion of the audi
ence. His closing remarks seconding Mr.
Stevenson and saying that all who dif
fered in 1896 should be welcomed to the
party In 1000, if they would come, were ap
plauded..
Spectators Grow Impatisnt.
â¢ Nebraska passed in the call for nom
inees, saying it had nobody to present
as a candidate. Nevada had F. G. New
lands present its views. He named Towne
as Nevada's chelce and the minute he
mentioned the name there were calls for
a vote. The audience was displaying Its
Impatience with the delay.
"When New Hampshire was called Col
onel Henry O. Kent made a very short
speech in favor of Stevenson.
Delegate Daly of New Jersey Â¦ arose to
second the nomination of Hill. He spoke
vigorously and . his terse speech called
forth loud cheers.
Patrick H. McCarren arose from his
seat when the roll call reached New York
and announced that the Empire State
would yield lta time to Delaware. Irving
Handy of that State took the platform,
and. like Mr. Daly, spoke for Hill. He
declared that although the Senator had
declined, a better soldier had never
walked beneath the Democratic flag and
when be was nominated he would take it.
The convention was becoming very im
patient" over the long list of seconding
speeches and there 'were freauent calls
of "Time" before he concluded. , . : ;
Senator White of California spoke ener
getically . from the. platform, â¢ declaring
that those who did not desire to hear the
nominating speeches could go out. If they
did not care to go out they should keep
auiet.
KANSAS CITY. July 6.â The Demo
cratic national ticket was com
pleted to-day by the nomination
of Adlai B. Stevenson for Vice
President. The nomination was
made on the first ballot. State after State
joining in the wild scramble to record
their support of the winning candidate. It
was not accompanied by any such fran
tic demonstration of approval as has
marked the proceedings at previous
stages, although the result followed a
spirited and at times highly dramatic
contest between the advocates of Steven
son. Towne Hill and the lesser candi
dates.
The distinct triumph of the day In the
way of a popular demonstration was that
accorded to Senator Hill, and its spon
taneity and its wild enthusiasm formed
one of the most notable features the con
vention has produced. It was accom
panied, too. by a remarkable scene, when
Hill earnestly protested to his friends
againtt being placed in nomination, and,
then, finding his protest in vain, strode to
The platform, and in tones which left no
doubt of their sincerity earnestly be
sought the convention not to make him
the nominee.
Thirty Thousand Spectators.
The proceedings to-day moved with
greater briskness than on the preceding
two day?, for there were none of the te
dious waits over platform and commit
tees. The aspect of the vast auditorium
was truly democratic when the session
began. Anticipating the close of the con
vention, the general public was admitted
freely, and as a result great crowds emp
tied into the body of the hall, not only
filling every available seat In the area
and aisles, but also overflowing Into- the
arena reserved for delegates, while some
more adventuresome individuals scaled
the iron girders and looked down from a
d!zzy height on 33,000 people parked be
low. The crowd practically took posses
sion of the jiroceedincs, and at times the
chairman and his officers w?re so power
less to proceed that they gave up to -the
multitude until the various demonstra
tions spent themselves.
On the call for Dominations Alabama
j :rldcd to Minnesota and the latter State
presented its young champion of silver
Republicanism and Democracy, Charles
A. Towne. The mention of his name was
a signal for a nattering demonstration in
his honor, men and women joining in the
outburst. Far off in a corner of the au
ditorium a young woman could be seen
frantically waving In one hand a litho
graph of the Minnesotan, and In the other
the ftarp and stripes. On the floor the
Nebraska, Minnesota and one or two
other delegations joined in -the demon
stration, but it was noticeable that it did
not evoke any widespread enthiisiasm
among tho?? who were about to do the
voting. Gradually other delegations be
gan to arise, some of the New Yorkers
petting to their feet, and for a moment
it looked as though the convention might
be carried off its feet. But against this
â¢was heard a counterstorm of protestation
and discordant hisses. For ten minutes
the demonstration for Towne lasted, with
varying degrees of Intensity. . . ; .i -'
Vain Pleading With Hill.
Meantime attention was being directed
to an excited group marscd in front of
the New York section, with I III! as the
vortex of a struggling throng of delegates.
They pr<Â»FFod forward from all "quarters
of the hall, urging him to permit his
name to be placed Lefore the convention.
The face ct the Xew Yorker was a study
as the demands upon him came from all
sides. He sat in the front row of dele
gates, with cx-Scnator Murphy on his
right and Judge Van Wyck on his imme
diate left. A second scat away was Mr.
Crcker. Hill protested vociferously.
Judpe Van Wyck said he could not refuse.
Mur;>hy and Croker pleaded with him to
ol>Â«Â»y the will of the convention and ac
cept.
While the pleadings continued the call
ol Delaware was h".-ird above the roar,
and Delaware yielded her place to New
York. At this? the bulky form of Senator
CJrady. the pilver-tor.gued orator of Xew
lork, pushed through the densely packed
aisles up to the platform. There was a
hush throughout the hall to hear what
word New i'ork had to offer.
"In behalf of the united Democracy of
><â¢Â«Â¦ York." shouted Grady, "I present as
a candidate fcr Vice President the name
of David Bennett Hill."
The effect was electrical and a tidal
â¢wave of enthusiastic approval swept over
the convention. Delegates stood on tiieir
chairs and waved frantically.mot ir. a few
scattered groups but in solid phalanxes.
I- lags and standards were acain mingled
in triumphant procession, while a roar as
from Niagara rolled through the great
structure. Grady stood there proudly
waiting for the Â«<Â»rm to subside. But as
ho waitâ¬-d the audience observed a 6trange
pa.ntnrr.ime. They Faw Hill leave the New
York dotation and pu*h through the
throng up to the platform. They could
sfe him appeal to CJrady to withdraw,
while Gra.dy ? answer was apparent from
the shake of his Iwad and his advance to
the front of the platform to continue his
nominasing spetrh. When the demonstra
tion had suicided Grady completed his
epcech placing Hill before the convention.
But as hf stepped from the platform, the
man v.ho had just been placed in nomi
nation took his p!a<?e. The Senator looked
out Bternij-, even savagely on the shout
ing thoutand3. When he could be heard
he made due acknowledgment of the
honor done him.
"But I cannot, I must not be the nomi
nee of this convention." he declared with
explosive emphasis. He was frequently
interrupted with enthuMa-sle shouts of ap
proval, but when he left the platform the
delegates were firmly convinced from his
words a:id manner that he was sincerely
desirous of haying his name withheld. It
is provable this alone prevented a nomi
nation by acclamation then and there, for
the tempestuous spirit manifested showed
that thÂ« convention was on the point of
bf-ing carried off Jts feet.
Stevenson Second Choice.
It was soon apparent that, with Hill
out. Stevrnson was a strong favorite
State after State seconded -his nomina
tionâOeoigia. .Indiana. Virginia, Iowa
Kentucky. Illinois*. Some of the devoted
friends of Hill still maintained their al
lpgianre tG him. and the delegations of
NÂ«Â»w Jersey. Louisiana and some others
seconded his nomination. Maryland
brought forward Governor John Walter
Smith, Washington named James Hamil
ton LÂ»Â»wis. North Carolina nominated Col
Â« nc-1 Julian Carr and Ohio presented the
name of A. W. Patrick.
It was after 2 o'clock when the Â«ec
onding Fpc-echeF. many of them weari
sorr.o. w*re concluded and .tho balloting
hegan. As the roll was about to be called
Mr. Lewis appeared on the platform and
in a few v.-ell-chosen words withdrew
'rorri tho contest. P*BMH
The vote was followed with intense In
teroFt. for when Alabama announced 3 for
Stevenson and 19 for Hill It looked as
though a c!o*e and exciting contest was
to occur.
But it soon was evident that Stevenson
had a strong lead. At the close of the call
lie had ioS 1^ votes, which, however, was
not enough to nominate, the requisite
number being C2i. Hill had received 200
votes and Towne W%.
But before the announcement of the re
sult a strong-lunged delegate from Ten
jtps.Â«eo stood on his chair and announced:
"Tpnn^ssee changes her 24 votes from
Hill to Stevenson."
That started the tide Irresistibly toward
Stevenson. From every quarter of Â¦ the
hall came demands for recognition. Ala
banfa changed for Stevenson: California
did the name; North Carolina changed
from Carr to Stevenson;. wen N*w York
finally and reluctantly announced its
change from Hill to Stevenson.
That ended it. Stevenson's nomination
v.Â£jÂ» assured, although for some time
longer the various States continued to re
cord their changes from Towne and other
candidates to Stevenson. In the ond the
nomination was made unanimous. Its an
nouncement was cheered with enthusias-
i North Dakota, from the floor, seconded
! the nomination of D. B. Hill.

Oregon from the floor seconded the nom
ination of J. Hamilton Lewis of Wash

Â¦ J. H. Snowden of Pennsylvania read
I his speech seconding Stevenson from a
I yellow slip of paper. Although he spoke
\ clearly and distinctly, tne crowd in its

such an extent that Chairman Richard

! South Carolina, from the floor, seconded
I the nomination of Stevenson.
Tennessee, also from the floor. Charles
E. Case making the speech, seconded the
nomination of that "matchless leader of
the New York Democracy, David B. Hill."
This was greeted with a howl of applause.
Texas for Stevenson.
Jonathan Lane of Texas promised to
be brief when he took the platform and
he kept his word, seconding the nomin

Utah, from the floor, seconded the nom
ination of Stevenson. Â¦Â¦*'Â¦' .^>-

Stevenson and the exciting scenes of yes

While the changes of the various States
were being made pandemonium reigned
in the hall. Delegates and alternates
stood on their chairs, and throughout all
of the galleries people were standing and
cheering. Practically the entire delega

left the hall. Women and children and
other spectators who had been standing
in the aisles during the proceedings and
a lot of superfluous special officers and
pages swarmed over the delegates' sec

stored the floor section of the hall bore
more the appearance of a miscellaneous

We declare It to be our intention to lend our

We the Silver Republican party in natlonad
convention assembled, declares these as our
principles and Invite the co-operation of all
who agree therewith:
We recojrr.lze that the principles set forth In
the Declaration of American Independence are
fundamental and everlastingly true In their ap
plication to governments among men. We be
lieve the patriotic words of Washington's fare
well adJress to be the words of soberness and
wisdom, inspired by the spirit of right and
truth. We treasure the words of Jefferson as
priceless gems of American statesmanship. We
hold In sacrod remembrance the broad philan
thropy and patriotism of Lincoln, who waa the
great interpreter of American history and the
great apostle of human rights and of indus
trial freedom, and we declare, aa was declared by
the convention that nominated the great eman
cipator, that the maintenance of the principles
promulgated In the Declaration of Independence
and embodied in the Federal constitution.
"That all men are created equal: that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain In
alienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness: that to
secure these rights governments are instituted
among men deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed." 1b es?>ontlal to the
preservation of our republican institutions.
FOR BIMETAIililSM.
We declare our adherence to the principle of
bimetallism ob the right basis of a monetary
system under our national constitution â a
principle that found place repeatedly In Re
publican platforms, from the demonetization of
silver in 1873, to the St. Louis Republican Con
vention Of 1S96.
Since that convention a Republican Congress
and a Republican President, at the dictation
of th* trusts and money power, have parsed and
approved a currency bill which In itself Is a re
pudiation of the doctrine of bimetallism ad
vocated theretofore by the President and every
great leader of the party.
This currency law destroys the full money
power of the silver dollar, provides for the pay
ment of all Government obligations and the
redemption of all forms cf paper money in gold
a jr, ne _ r etlres the time-honored and patriotic
greenbacks, constituting one-sixth of the
money in circulation, Â«nd surrenders to banking
corporations a sovereign function of issuing all
psper money, thus enabling these corporations
to control the prices of labor and property by
Increasing or diminishing the volume of money
in circulation, thus giving the banks power to
create panics and bring disaster upon business
er.terprlf-ps.
The provisions of this currency law making
the bonded debt of the republic payable In gold
alone changes the contract between the Govern
ment and the bondholders to the advantage of
the latter and is in direct opposition to the dec
laration of the Matthews resolution passed by
Congress in 1S78, for which resolution the pres
ent Republican President, then a member of
Congress, voted, as <l!d also all leading Re
publican*, both In the House and in the Senate.
CURRENCY AND INCOME TAX.
KANSAS CITY, July 6.â After many
changes the national convention
of the Silver Republicans adopt
ed the following platform:
The Silver Republican party of the United
States, in the foregoing principles, seeks to per
petuate the spirit and to adhere to the teach
ings of Abraham Lincoln.
We declare the Porto Rican tariff to be not
only a serious but a dangerous departure from
the principles of our form of government. We
believe in a republican form of government and
are opposed to monarchy and to the whole
theory of imperialistic control. We believe in
solf-government â a government by consent of
the governed â and are unalterably opposed to
a government based on force. It Is clear and
certain that the inhabitants of the Philippine
Archlpelugo cannot be made citizens of the
United States without endangering our clvi'
izatlon. We are therefore In favor of applying
to the Philippine Archipelago the principle we
nre solemnly and publicly pledged to observe
in the case of Cuba.
There being no longer any necessity for col
lecting war taxes, we demand the repeal of the
war tuxes levied to carry on the war with
Spain.
We favor the Immediate admission Into the
union as States of the Territories of Arizona,
New Mexico and Oklahoma.
We demand that our nation's promises to
Cuba shall be fulfilled In every particular.
TO RECLAIM ARID LANDS. ,
We believe the national Government should
lend every aid, encouragement and asslftance
toward the reclamation of arid lands of the
United States, and to that end we are in favor
of a. comprehensive survey thereof and an Imme
diate ascertainment of the water supply avail
able for such reclamation, and we believe it to
be the duty of the general Government to pro
vide for the construction of storage reservoirs
and irrigation works so that the water supply
of the arid region may be utilized to the great
est possible extent In the Interests of the peo
ple, while preserving all rights of the State.
Transportation is a public necessity and the
means and methods of it are matters of public
concern. Railway companies exerclee a power
over industries, business and commerce which
they ought not to do and should be made to
serve the public interests without asking un
reasonable charges or unjust discrimination.
We observe with satisfaction the growing
sentiment among the people In favor of the
public ownership and operation of public utili
ties.
WOULD EXPAND TRADE.
We are in favor of expanding our commerce
In the' interests of American labor and for the
benefit of all our people by every honest and
peaceful means. Our creed and our history
justify the nations of the earth In expecting
that wherever the American flag is unfurled
humane labor laws and political liberty will be
found. We protest against the adoption of any
policy that will change In the thought of the
world the meaning of our flag.
We are opposed to the Importation of Asiatic
laborers In competition with American . labor
and favor a more rigid enforcement of the laws
rPlRtins thereto.
We tender to the patriotic people of the
South African republics our sympathy and ex
press our admiration for them In their heroic
attempts to preserve their political freedom
and maintain their national Independence. We
declare the destruction of these republics
and the subjugation of their people to be a
crime against civilization. We believe this
sympathy should have been voiced by the
American Congress as was done in the case of
the French, the Greeks, the Hungarians, the
Poles, the Armenians and the Cubansâ
and as the traditions of this country would
have dictated. Â«
SYMPATHY FOK BOEBS.
In view of the Â»rreat sacrifice made and pa
triotic services rendered, we are in favor of
liberal pensions to deserving soldiers, their
widows, orphans and other dependents. We be
lieve the enlistment and service should be ac
cepted as conclusive proof that the soldier was
free from disease and disability at the time of
Ills enlistment. We condemn the present ad
ministration of the pension laws.
orea principles of the American people before '
the constitution was adopted, but Is vlnlative
of the principles of the constitution Itself, and
we shall not cease our efforts until there has
been established in Its place a monetary system
based upon the free and unlimited coinage <?t
silver and cold Into money at the present lefral
rntio of 16 to 1 by the Independent action of the
United States, under which system all paper
money shall be Issued direct by the Govern
ment, nnd all such money coined or Issued shall
be a full lesal tender In payment of all debts,
public and yrivate, without exception.
We are In favor of a graduated tax upon in
comes and if necessary to accomDllsh this we
favor an amendment to the constitution.
We believe that United States Senators ought
to be elected by a direct vote of the people,
and we favor such amendment to the constitu
tion and such legislation as may bÂ» necessary
to that end.
We favor the maintenance and the extension,
wlierever practicable, of the merit system In
the public service, appdlntments to be mad.? ac
cording to fitness, competitively ascertained,
and public servants to be retained in office
as long as shall be compatible with the effi
ciency of the service.
TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES.
Combinations, trusts and monopolies contrived
and arranged for the purpose of controlling th<
prices and quantity of articles supplied to the
public are unjust, unlawful and oppressive.
Not only do thes>e unlawful conspiracies fix
the price of commodities in many cases, but
they Invade every branch of the State and na
tional governments with their polluting influ
ence and control the actions of their 'employes
and dependent!! In private life until their influ
ence actually Imperils society and the liberty or
the citizen. We declare against them. "We de
mand the most stringent laws for their de
struction and the most severe punishment of
their promoters and malntalners and the ener
getlo enforcement of such laws by the courts.
' We believe the Monroe doctrine to be sound
in principle and a wise national policy, and we
(lomand a firm adherence thereto. We con
demn acts Inconsistent with it and that tend
to make ua parties to the Interests and to in
volve us In the controversies of European na
tions and the recognition by pending treaty of
the right of England to be considered in the
construction of an interoceanic- canal. We de
clare that such canal, when constructed, ought
to be controlled by the United States In the
interests of American nations.
We observe with anxiety and regard with
disapproval the increasing ownership of Ameri
can lands by aliens and their growing control
over our International transportation, natural
resources and public utilities. We demand leg
islation to protect our public domain, our na
tional resource*, our franchises and our inter
national commerce and to keep them free and
maintain their independence of all foreign mo
nopolies, institutions and influences, and we
declare our opposition to the leasing of the
public lands of the United States, whereby
corporations and syndicates will be able to
secure control thereof and thus monopolize the
public domain, the heritage of the people.
We are In favor of the principles of direct
legislation.
Nevada sent up Congressman New
lands, more dapper and exquisite than
even George Fred Williams. He repeat
ed Governor Stone's picture and threw a
halo around Towne. Following him Con
gressman William Daly of New Jersey
created some excitement by seconding
Hill's nomination. Daly Is the man who
suggested Imperialism as the paramount
issue In the committee on resolution's. It
was due to his efforts that a compromise
v.-as effected and t.iat the convention w,as
spared a bitter contest over the platform.
ItiUeed. It is said that Daly himself drew
up the resolution. Next Levin Irvlns
Iiandy, ex-Consressraan from Delaware,
appeared in a figured blue shirt and neg
ligee costume, and seconded Hill's nomi
nation. The audience had received about
all it could stand. It objected to being
tuked to death. Handy's speech was good,
but so lengthy that he was fairly driven
from the platform. S. M. Gaddl3 created
some wonder by placing Julian S. Carr
in nomination on behalf of North Caro
lina,. Ohio developed a peculiar oratori
cal bird, who twittered long and sweetly
Newlands Talks for Towne.
When Kentucky was called there were
Â«hrill shouts for Joe Blackburn. Gov
ernor McCreary took his place. His picca
dilly collar, white cravat and Immaculate
shirt front were typical of his speech. Ho
was as meek as his personal appearance
Indicated, and his speech was In the gen
uine Kentucky style.
J. Leo Knox of Maryland presented the
name of John W. Smith, Its new Gov
ernor. Then George Fred Williams, as
elegant as an English Duke, paid a deli
cate tribute to New York, and seconded,
Towne's nomination. His voice was as
shrill as the chirp of a locust. He made
the remarkable statement that Towne
wanted to become a Democrat several
years ago, but was dissuaded by the
Democrats themselves, who thought that
he could be of more advantage if he re
mained within the ranks of the silver Re
publicans. By this time, the- play became
wearisome. The audience shut off the
elegant George Fred by shouting "Time,
time, time." He took the hint and bowed
his acknowledgment.
Hernado de Soto Money, Senator from
Mississippi, scored the suggestion of
Towne's nomination, because ho was not
a Democrat, and substituted the name of
Stevenson. Here there were loud shouts
of "Stone. Stone." The ex-Governor of
Missouri climbed the platform when the
name of his State was called. The band
played "Dixie, 1 and he received a per
fect ovation. He had an Ideal Southern
face. In choice words he rebuked Sena
tor Money for his reference to Towne. He
pictured the scene in the National Re
publican Convention four years ago when
Senator Teller and Charles A. Towne
walked out of the hall. Towne was en
titled to great honor and to respectful
consideration here. Everybody supposed
that the Governor was about to second
Towne's nomination, but he wound up by
pledging himself to Stevenson.
Illinois yielded to Connecticut. Homer
S. Cummings. a new political star In the
land of steady habits, took the platform.
He surprised everybody by seconding
Towne's nomination, and none more so
than James R. Williams of Illinois. He
sprang upon the chair and protested. Ho
said that Illinois had yielded to Connecti
cut with the express understanding that
a delegate from that State was to second
Stevenson's nomination. It turned out
that Mr. Cummines had mistaken his
turn. Minnesota had promised to yield
to him to express his personal prefer
ence. At this Connecticut sent a second
delegate to the platform. He was James
Kennedy. Illinois was satisfied with h!3
tribute to â¢ her favorite son, and W. II.
Dunphy appeared and shot off a rocket
for James Hamilton Lewis. It had hardly
dlappeared before Indiana gave way to
Virginia, Congressman William A. Jones
of that State in terse words pledged the
old Commonwealth to Stevenson.
Springs a Surprise.
These personal reasons had been pre
viously stated to one of his closest
friends. To this friend he said that he
could not take it because If he did so he
would be forced to give up Wolperts
Roost, as he could not aoffrd to run two
establishments, one in Washington, and
the other in Albany. His Income wa3 In
sufficient to maintain the exalted position
of Vice President in the way that it ought
to be maintained. In his view the Vice
President ought to keep "open house and
lavishly entertain."
He said: "I did not come Into this con
vention as a candidate. I did not expect
to be one, and I cannot accept the honor."
As ho started to leave the platform a
crowd of distinguished men began to
eagerly shake his hand. The cheers of
those witnessing the scene were almost
appalling in volume.
The next speaker to appear on the plat
form was Thomas Hutchmson of Georgia.
He -was as meek and trim in appearance
as a block of polished steel, lie placil
a written speech upon the desk, and read
it three feet away, declaiming it perfectly
and speaking so that every ear in the
vast building could hear each word. Mr.
Hutchlnson on behalf of his State sec
onded Stevenson's nomination.
As Mr. Grady descended the steps and
rejoined the . New York delegation Hill
advanced to the desk. He bowed his head
in recognition of the volume of cheera
that greeted him. and declined the nomi
nation. When he declared that he felt it
his duty to say that for personal reasons
and good and valid reasons he could not
accept, there was renewed applause and
shouts: "You must accept It."
Ex-Senator White of California an<l
Senator Jones of Arkansas bent their
heads and were apparently urging him to
accept the compliment. Hl!l shook his
head repeatedly, and the crowd of digni
taries added their importunity to those
of the Senators. Meantime the tumult
subsided and Senator Grady resumed his
speech. He said that Governor Hill might
decline, but decline or not. he added. New
York's united and solid seventy-two votes
would be cast to the end for David Den
nett Hill. At the end of each sentence
Hill repeated: "I will not take it. This
is absolutely unfair. You should not do
lt." Finally Hill appealed to PÂ«r;kÂ» â
Jones, saying: "This Is not wise. It
should not be forced on mo. nel;> me fti.^
it." The Senator is reported to have re
plied: "Go on and decline. I'll help you
out. I'll see the district leaders. You
are right. Go on and make your speech."
Urged to Accept.
While the delegates were in this parox
ysm of enthusiasm ex-Governor Hill and
Augustus Van "Wyck sat Just behind Mr.
Grady. Hill was apparently exceedingly
annoyed. His face was a study for a
physiognomist.
"On behalf of the united Democracy of
the State of New York. I present to this
convention the name of David B. Hill as
its candidate for the Vice Presidency."
A dramatic scene t nsued. At first the au
dience .seemfil to distrust its e;irs. It wa.i
apparently lost In wonderment. Finally
comprehending -the full force and slg-
Clttcanct ol tne St-nator's words, it burse
into an Indescribable uproar. Hundreds
of flags were produced and waved with
spasmodic enersy. The uproar hus fear
ful, at least twenty guidons, Including
those of Hawaii. Mississippi. California.
North Dakota, Alabama. .Maryland anÂ«l
New YorK, were instantly grouped in
front of the platform. Tin? hand played a.
martial air and the New iuik guiaon was
twirled in time with the music.

lork had mounted the platform and stood
at the side of Senator Jones. With unusual
celerity David B. lliil followed him. As

apparently chagrined. Stanaing upon the

CALL HEADQUARTERS, KANSAS
CITY. Mo.. July 6.-A11 night long
were tho tribes warring over the
prooosed candidates for the Vice
Presidential nomination. The New
York mfsjionarits worked unceas
ingly for Kel!ar with no encouraging re
sults. The Stevenson men wore far more
successful. At least a dozen Unite! States
Senators who had served with Adlai E.
Stevenson when he was Vice Pres'd-nt
were taking an interest In his canvass. To
this force were added a score of ex-Con
grepsmen and i score of the present Rep
resentatives of tho House, al! of whom
were personally acquainted with him ar.d
were his admirers. Mr. Stevenson made
hlmsMf very popular while In AVyshins
ton. Of an eminent and social disposition;
he was very approachable, and always
ready to do his friends service. Aside
from this he is a Kentuckian by birth and
a relative of Henry Watterson. Senator
Blackburn entered into tht- tight with all
his ardor and Governor McCreery and
each member of the delegation were act
ively at work. They penetrated to the
mos't obscure delegations and engendered
a sentiment that was sure to lend him as
sistance. Meanwhile the friend3 of
Charles A. Towne were not idle, under
the leadership of Senator Teller of Colo
rado, the Towne conduits were laid, but
the electric batteries were weak, and no
currents were preceptible. Strong efforts
were made to get Air. Bryan to visit the
city before the vote was taken. It was
thought that his presence here, and pos
sibly an occasional word for Towne,
might Insure a favorable result. It was
alleged confidentially that Bryan was sure
to come, but there was no confirmatory
news from Lincoln. Without his presence
the struggle was hopeless. No other can
didate developed any strength whatever.
This morning David B. Hill sent word
to Senator Murphy and Croker that if the
New York delegation would change Its
candidate for Vice President. Mr. Hill
would present him to the convention. The
proposition was received with some sur
prise. It was probably at first regarded
as a bid for the nomination of Elliot
Danforth. Further negotiations were post
poned until the New York delegates had
taken their seats in the hall. The con
vention had adjourned until half past 10
this morning. At that hour the New
Yorkers were In their places. Friends in
the outside delegations who were favor
ably disposed toward Governor Hill were
called into confidence with Senator Mur
phy and Croker. and Hill was asked
whether he would present the name of
Lewis Nixon to the convention. As Nixon
is a firm believer in the doctrine of the
American Shipping League, and an ardent
supporter of restoring our merchant
marine by liberal subsidies, and makes no
concealment of his convictions, outsiders
protested against this selection. Hill was
then told that he could have the support
of the New York delegation if he desired,
and again refused to accept it. He had
been offered the nomination In his confer
ence with Croker and Senator Murphy
prior to the first meeting of the delegation
on Thursday afternoon. He declined It.
saying he did not believe the ticket could
be elected if the platform contained a
specific plank declaring for free silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. This statement was
made by one of the conferees during the
conflict "between Croker and himself when
Augustus Van Wyck was selected as the
New York representative on the commit
tee on resolutions. It was not denied by
Hill.
Disorder and Confusion.
The hall this morning was packed to
suffocation when Chairman Richardson
appeared at his desk. The weather was
excessively hot and the atmosphere
stifling. There was hardly breeze enough
to waft the thistledown through the air
and banners hung limp for a long time.
The disorder and confusion was so great
that Chairman Richardson pounded his
desk at least ten minutes before he could
begin to restore order. About this time
Benjamin Shlvely threaded his way
through the struggling crowd, and took
his seat with the Indiana delegation, fan
ning himself lustily. The confusion was
so great that very few recognized him. It
was increased by the action of some one
who had shifted the guidons of the New
Jersey and Texas delegations. Each squad
had followed Its guidon and as there were
less seats in the New Jersey delegation
than in that of Texas there was great
trouble.
It required some time to straighten It
out At last, however, partial order was
restored and the rollcall of States for pre
sentation of candidates was begun. Ar
kansas promptly yielded to Illinois, and
Congressman J. R. Williams of that State
wended his way to the platform. His
short alpaca coat was buttoned across his
breast, and he wore a white tie. He looked
even thinner than on the previous day.
Bending forward and Inflating his lungs,
he launched himself Into his speech plac
ing Adlal Stevenson in nomination. The
confusion was so great that only occa
sional sentences could be heard. Applause
followed the statement that Stevenson
was "One who Is not a Rough Rider, but
a swift rider." "When he added that he
was also a man who places human blood
above human greed there was profound
silence. There was a great demonstration
when Williams concluded. The Illinois
delegation led with a rousing salvo of
applause, at least two-thirds of the dele
gates loinlng in. The uproar lasted fully
five minutes.
Towne's Boom Launched.
Connecticut yielded to Minnesota. She
sent to the platform L. A. Roesing. As he
took the chairman by the hand there were
loud shouts of "Towne!" "Towne!" They
came from the galleries on the right of
the chair. Clad In blue serge and wear-
Ing a broad leather belt and stand-up col
lar, Mr.. Roesing pitched his voice in high
tenor and launched the Towne boom. His
speech lacked energy and magnetic force.
While acknowledging that Mr. Towne was
not a member of the Democratic party he
declared he was a Democrat by conviction.
As he closed the Minnesota delegation ex
cited an outburst of enthusiasm. It rose
In a body waving flags and shouting itself
hoarse. There was no response from other
delegations, but there was from the gal
leries. -It was evident that Towne's
friends were there In full force. They
reallv did all the cheerins and shouting,
but failed to budge any voters. The up
roar lasted several minutes, varying in
force, and at times resembling the noise
of a tornado. For a long time did Long
Jim Richardson pound his desk and wave
his fan in an effort to bring the conven
tion to its sober senses. Once he nearly
secured order, but the band burst Into the
strains of "America," and Towne's friends
in the galleries regained control.
Meantime there was some excitement in
the New York delegation, its leaders sur
rounding the chair of Mr. Hill. Among
them was William Daly of New Jersey.
Secator Murphy was urging Hill to accept
the nomination as a candidate from New
York Hill repeatedly refused. Croker re
peated Senator Murphy's request. "Go
ahead and accept it." he said. "I do not
want it." Hill replied. Daly shouted:
"You can't refuse." Hill tried to convince
them that Stevenson was as good a can
didate as he was. It was evident that the
vote had been taken in the New York del
egation and that it had. been determined
to place the Elmlra statesman in the field
regardless of his wishes.
Hill's Name Presented.
When Colorado was called Governor
Thomas of that State seconded Towne's
nomination. His speech created no furor,
because it could not be heard. In vain
did he teeter up and down, shaking his
head and using both index flnger3. Not a
word was audible to the ears of three
quarters of , the audience. There were
shouts of "louder" and he subsided amid
wild cries of "Time! Time!" During his

Cummings Tells Whu Hill Could
Not Afford to Accept the Vice-
Presidential Nomination.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. KANSAS CITY. July C.-Adlai E. Stevenson of
Illinois was to-day nominated for Vice President by the Democratic Xa
tional Convention in obedience to the orders received from William J.
Bryan, candidate for President Mr. Stevenson's nomination was predicted
in The Call on Wednesday morning, and since that time there has not
brer\ the slightest doubt tnat he woul.l win. There was only a remote possi
bility that the convention might run wild and nominate Hill, "out even this pos
sibility was dispelled by Hill's resolution not to accept the nomination under
ai y circumstances. At 1:30 o*cioÂ« k this mcrninj? he concluded a conference with
Â«Â¦ srht eheirmen of State delegations, ami instructed them 10 pass the word around
tÂ»~at he positively could not and would not accept Hill was met by The Call's
Hiil fW nl Â¦Ilv on the way home from ttaie conference, ana the statement made by
h;rn pub!iFh*<3 in this mornings Call, that he was determined not to accept, and
predicting Stevenson's nomination, settled the matter beyond a doubt.
Several of the correspondents were at a very late hour last night aware that
Ec-ator "White Â£nd other chairman of dedications were in .tttcntlance at the con
ference but could not stata this fact without violating conliuence. At the
6-n-c time they were perfectly at liberty to print Hill's statement. This was
an important piece of news, for it showed that Bryan and Hill. Senator White
and other leaders had teen in conference and that they had all decided on Ste
venson as Bryan** running mat*-.
The New York delegation deoided to vote for Hill Instead of Ivellar at the
last moment for just before entering the convention Croker stated to a Call
representative that Thomas F. Grady would place Mr. Kellar in nomination.
F.ut after boidins a confab in their reservation in convention hail. Tammany
and tbe delegate* from Kinps County united in an attempt to stampede the con
vention for Hill. It was nipped In the bud by Hill himself, who took the plat
form i-na announced that he could not take the nomination under any clrcura-
Ounlo" 1Â« divided in regard to Croker's motive for attempting to force the
nomination upon Hill In spite of his expressed wishes. The general impression
here however, :s that l*e did It for the purpose of embarrassing Hill.
There was a dramatic Kese in the conception when Senator Thomas F.
GraiV- p:aced II"!'s carr.e before the delegates. During the whirlwind of ap
pauÂ«=<? aid ch~ers which followed the announcement that New York would n^om
Â«"ai<* her farmer Seaator, Hill himself strode to Senator Grady's side and de
cided to be allowed to make his position known. Senator Grudy refused to
yield to Hill, and it was ciHy after nominating speeches had been made that Hill
waÂ« able to celiver a diplomatic speech, in which he gave the convention to un
derstand that if :t persisted in making him Bryan's running mate he would de
cl'.ne the nomination.
If it was the hope of Kill's sponsors that fc'.s refusal to accept the nomina
tion Â»-ou1d caufs hiin to be criticized they were disappointed. Stevenson, while
fce did rot ";iepire enthusiasm, vras looked upon by the convention as a safe
and conservative candidate, who would add to the Populist. Silver Republican
arid Chicago platform Democratic following of Bryan a portion of the Cleveland
vote, which left the party four years asjo.
Brvan'e irfiu^r.ce was exerted for Stevenson, and this insured his nomination
3*1 tne first ballot. At the end of the roll call Stevenson had received 568^
rotes.- BUI IPS votes, Towne 91% votes, while Elliot Danforth of New York,
former Governor Hogg of Texas. B. S. Carr of North Carolina and A. W. Patrick
cf Ohio received one vote each.
As socn as it -was seen that the nomination of Stevenson was inevitable the
Elates which hcA given complimentary votes to other candidates made haste
to join with the majority, thus making the nomination unanimous. It was
noticeable that the vote of Nebraska. Bryan's own State, was divided between
Eteverson and Tuvr.e. the nurnlr.ee of the Populists ar.d the idol of the Free Sil
ver liep-utlicsns. Towne got the 1km" s share of the vote and this was regarded
a* substantiating the report that Eryan wished to show his friendliness for
Towne. though he knew his nomination in a Democratic convention was Im
possible.
Townc'i defeat was a severe blow to the Silver Republicans, but they had
foreseen it ar.d had made up their minds to make the best of It. Towne him
s.?lf is preparing to withdraw from the field altogether, so that the Populists and
Silver Republicans may unite with the Democrats upon Bryan and Stevenson.
As socn as the convention had b*Â«n declareÂ© adjourned all of the delegates,
who could do so, hurried to the railway station and Jeft for home. The heat

LINCOLN, July 6.â Mr. Bryan reiter
ated to-day that* he was unable as yet to
outline his programme for the coming
campaign. He did not know when a con
ference with the- National Committee
would be held in regard to the matter.
Mr. Bryan had a number of callers to-day,
all coming to extend congratulations and
express gratification over his nomination.
There was more real Interest locally in
the outcome of the struggle for second
place on the ticket than in Mr. Bryan's
nomination. When the bulletin came an
nouncing the selection of Hon. Adlal E.
Stevenson, Mr. Bryan experessed his
pleasure and soon afterward dictated the
following:
"Mr. Stevenson is an excellent man for
the place. He supported the ticket In 1S96
and can defend tne platform of 1900.
Towne would have strengthened the
ticket in the States where there is fusion
between the Democrats, Populists and
Silver Republicans, but the support given
Mr. Stevenson in the convention shows
that Mr. Stevenson is a more available
Â¦man. The choice has fallen upon one
who is in every respect worthy of the
position."
Mr. Bryan then sent the following tele
gram:
LINCOLN. Nebr.. July 6.â Hon. Adlal E.
Stevenson, Bloomlngton, 111.: Accept congratu
lations upon your nomination. It was a de
served recognition of party service. >!
XV. J. BRYAN.
All through the day telegrams of con
gratulation poured In upon the Presiden
tial candidate.
Among Mr. Bryan s early callers were
H. B. Paul and J. S. Smith of New.'Jer
sey, who came in from Kansas City this
morning. They told Mr. Bryan that they
were hopeful of carrying that State for
him and they believed New York without
doubt would go Democratic. Mr. Bryan
this evening received the following tele
gram :
MINNETOKA BEACH, Minn., July 6.âAc
cept my congratulations upon your unanimous
nomination.? ADLAI E. STEVENSON.
Mr. Bryan said he expected a number of
visitors, some prominent in the councils of
the Democratic party, beginning to-mor
row and continuing this week. He would
not specify -who they were.- People !n

ator Dubois offered a resolution pledging
the support of the Silver Republicans to
A dial E. Stevenson, but there was oppo
sition and action was postponed until
after a conference with the committee
appointed by the Democratic Convention.
Mr. Towne was followed by Delegate
Shafroth of Colorado, who favored sup
porting the ticket nominated by the Dem
ocratic Convention. Meanwhile the great
est confusion prevailed. Delegates gath
ered in groups on the floor and excitedly
discussed the situation. â¢ Senator Dubois
was recognized and said:
"While there are manysad hearts here,
no one feels more keenly than my
self the disaster which has overtaken us
to-day. But we must view it as our
leader, Charley Towne. wants us to. I
move that the whole question be left to
the committee with plenary powers."
Amid much confusion the previous ques
tion was called for. It was . on Senator
Dubois' motion and by an almost unani
mous vote lt - was carried and the conven
tion adjourned Bine die.
The national committee : of the Silver
Republicans organized by electing D. C.
He insisted that there was an Issue In
the coming election which towered above
men and he implored the convention to
look at it as he did. lie begged them to
remember that Bryan was still at the
head. The platform of the Democratic
party was almost identical, at least in
principle, with the platform of the Silver
Republican party.
While Mr. Towne was speaking several
attempts were made to Interrupt him with
questions. The convention howled down
these attempts until Mr. Towne yielded to
the question, after which Mr. Towne
again insisted that It was his wish that
the convention should not nominate him.
The convention gave Mr. Towne a most
respectful consideration and while he was
speaking it was evident that the con
vention was disposed to follow Mr.
Towne's advice and wishes.
"The Silver Republicans have made a
good fight," said Mr. Towne. "They have
been defeated, but it Is our duty to sup
port the ticket nominated by the Demo
cratic National Convention."

Claims That the Government Ha3
Prevented Many Citizens From
Obtaining Justice.
PARIS, July 8â A disgraceful scene oc
curred In the Chamber of Deputies to-day.
M. Lascies (Nationalist), noted for his ex
treme views, interpellated the Government
upon the pressure which he alleged was
put on the Judiciary by the Government
in order to prevent many citizens from
obtaining Justice. He instanced the suit
of Major Fritsch against M. Urbain
Gohier. based on the latter's article in
the Aurore. stigmatizing Fritsch as a
felon. ,/ .. . ,
Fritsch is the officer who was dismissed
from the general staff by General the
Marquis Galifet, the former Minister of
War. for divulging the Temps' letters.
The hearing of this suit was postponed
by order of the Government because it
would result in Inconvenient revelations.
M Lascies was several times called to
order and finally, at the request of M.
Deschanel. President of the Chamber,
the house voted a refusal to hear him.
This action created an uproar and M.
Deschanel was compelled to suspend tne
sitting. M. Lascies. who remained in the
tribune, emphatically declared he would

throng of Deputies and tried to strike M.
Waldeck-Rousseau, but some of the Depu
ties held him back.
The ushers intervened and separated the
belligerent parties. M. Lascies then re
gained the tribune.
In the meanwhile similar scenes were
occurring in the lobby. Cards and the
names of seconds were exchanged be

FIGHT IN CONVENTION HALL.
KANSAS CITY. July 6.â In Convention
Hall, where the Democratic hosts have
assembled for tour days past, there was a
marked change of scene to-night- The
thousands of handsomely gowned women
have disappeared. On the platform
where but a few hours previously states
men of national prominence had faced
cheering thousands, the tables and chairs
had given way to a squared rlnfc. In which
Oscar Gardner and Eddie Santry of Chi
cago appeared for a twenty-round go.
About 3000 admirers of the manly art
gathered to witness the contest of the
featherweights.
The so-called fight was a more or less
gentle contest, which terminated In a de
cision by George Slier in favor of Santry
at the end of the stipulated twenty
rounds. Both men came out of the fight
as fresh as they entered It. and aside
from a swing by Santry on Gardner's sore
left eye, which opened up the old wound
and another swing on Gardner's right eye'
which started the blood a little, there was
nothing In the fight that approached hard
jolting. Santry was the aggressor, but
most of his blows were blocked
The real pugilistic event of the evenlnr
was a rattling preliminary In which Bobbv
Quade of Kansas City knocked out Tom
my Redman of Chicago in the second
round. They met for ten rounds.

LEXIXGTOX, Ky., July 6. â Starter James B. Ferguson Is dying here to
night at High Oaks Sanitarium, where he was taken a few days ago on hla
return from Louisville, where he had placed himself in the care of phy
sicians. His ailment is the result of an old wound inflicted in a fight
here some years ago. The bullet was carried in his body for years and
until removed recently In California. His son, Garnett Ferguson, arrived to-night
from San Francisco and his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Chlnn,
who are in New York, have been notified to come at once to his bedside.
NEW YORK, July 6.â News has been
received from Rome that the Popt
has excommunicated J. Rene Vil
latte, at one time the head of the
Old Catholics in this country,
whose submission to the Roman church
was announced about two years ago. The
Catholic authorities had refused to recog
nize Villatte's title to an archbishopric,
and there was a rupture which caused
him to leave Rome and go to France. The
act for which Villatte was excommuni
cated was the consecration as Bishop of
an Italian ex-priest known as Don Ml
raglia.
PARIS, July 6. â An American who
styles himself "J. Renatus, Archbishop,"
has for some months set the church au
thorities of Paris by the ears. The fol
lowing circular issued by Cardinal Rich
ard, Archbishop of Paris and Primate of
France, to his clergy on April 1, will ex
plain how:
Archbishop's Circular.
"It has come to my knowledge that Mr.
Villatte, who calls himself an American
bishop, has performed, to my annoyance,
two sacerdotal ordinations in Paris and
has given to them the license with which
ecclesiastics are provided. I have been
informed by the holy office that Mr. Vil
latte has not received any authority nor
jurisdiction from the Sovereign Pontiff.
In consequence, if any of the ecclesiastics
are presented to you, you will not permit
them to celebrate the mass in your
church."
To this Villatte. who has established
himself in a mansion surrounded by a
garden and containing a chapel, on the
Boulevard Pereire. where he dispenses
hospitality and spiritual aid to American
visitors, replies:
Vilatte's Reply.
"As you question my archtepiscopal
character, I Inform you that I have been
legitimately consecrated Archbishop and
that I have the proof at your disposal.
In regard to the ordinations, you were
not informed of them, because I have an
abundance of personal authority, which
makes my ordinations valid. Moreover, I
performed four ordinations, not two. and
1 have only licensed those ordained to say
mass in my chapel and not in churches
where you are master. You say further
that you are informed by the holy of
fice that I have received no power from
the Sovereign Pontiff. You are badly in
formed. I have made complete submis
sion to Rome. By this act alone I have
regained possession of temporalities, ac
cording to the example of the bishops of
the first aces. It has pleased your Eml
! nence to declare me a dissenter from
| Rome, but I declare myself to be in unity
with Jesus Christ and the Holy Koman
Catholic and Apostolic church."
Villattc claims that his reconciliation
with Rome took place April 2, 1S92.
Pretender's Identity.
Archbishop Villatte Is known all over
the United States and in Canada and Eng
land as "J. Rene Villatte." He was the
leader of what has been termed the "Old
Catholic movement" in this country, and
was at one time the head of a secession
of Polish Catholics In Wisconsin.
The following sketch of his life was
grfven to the press by his adherents:
: "Archbishop Villatte was born in Paris
forty years apo (which would make him
forty-six at this writing), and was edu
cated for the Roman priesthood, coming
to 'America in 1878. while pastor of the
Church of Calvary at Green Bay, Wis.,
he became convinced that the doctrine
of Papal infallibility was an error, and
went to Switzerland, where he was or
dained' deacon by the Old Catholic, Bish
op of that country.
"Returning to Wisconsin, he went to
work In a one-story cottage at Little
Sturgeon, one side of which was used as
a chapel and the other as the priest's
official residence, furnished with boxes
and barrels for chairs, and hay and an
old carpet for a bed. He lived there a
whole winter on cheese and bread. His
congregation grew rapidly and finally a
church was built, and then another and
another. Then came the revolt of the
Polish churches, and Villatte established
himself at Cleveland, Ohio, where he pro
posed to become the Pope of a church
which should make that city as important
as Rome itself."
Expoused Various Creed3.
According to the claims of the Catholic
press Villatte was successively a Calvln
ist. an Episcopalian, an Old Catholic, a
follower of Dollinger, of Pere Hyaclnthe,
the Metropolitan of Malabar, "whose re
ligion Is a mixture of Nestorianism and
Buddhism, and who is shunned by Cath
olic, Greek and Anglican clergymen."
While in Asia he became Interested in
reform, and issued a catechism which
the Roman Archbishop of Colombo de
clared to contain seventy heresies. Cath
olic leaders in this country say that
Villatte was consecrated Archbishop by
the schlpmatlc Metropolitan of Antloch.
in Asia Minor. The best Informed of VII
latte's supporters claimed that he had re
ceived his archlepiscopal rank from the
Archbishop of Goa, Ceylon, who conferred
on him the title "Archbishop of Amer
ica."

POPE EXCOMMUNICATES
PRETENDER VILLATTE
Claimed Title to an Archbishopric and
Sought to Consecrate an Ex-
Italian Priest.
Bpectel Dispatch to The Call
SAN RAFAEL, June â¬.â Society at Bo
linas is stirred up over the elope
ment of beautiful Miss Josie Garcia and
Albert Reynolds of Olema. this county.
The young lady in question belongs to one
of the oldest Spanish families In the
county and has long been famous for her
Furjiassiiig beauty. She was raised at
Olema.; the home of her family, and is
about 17 years of age. Mr. Reynolds,
the gallant lover, is a hard-working young
man who was raised in this county. It
appears that the present disappearance of
the your.g people is due to close and long
acquaintance. Miss Garcia's parents ob
jected to the suit of Mr. Reynolds upon
the ground of the extreme youth of the
young iady and the lijjancial condition of
the prospective proom.
Bevi rai month? ago Miss Garcia went
to Boiinas to visit some friends and Mr.
Reynolds was also a frequent visitor at
that town. On the night of the Fourth
a ball was priven at JJruids' Hall in Bo
linas ar.d among the young ladies who
lent charm to the occasion was Miss Gar
cia. Mr. Reynolds was also there.
From the developments in the case It
appears that Mrs. Guadaloupe Garcia, the
firi"s mother, suspected the meeting of
The young people at the ball and conse
quently drove all the way from Olema for
the purpose of frustrating any plans the
young folks may have formed. Mrs. Gar
cia drove to Mrs. I-a Joran's home,
whore her daughter was staying. Just
what happened will perhaps never be
known. Humor has it that a desperate
liattle was fought between mother and
daughter, in which the ffirl's ball dress
was torn from her person. The mother
wa? afterward seen carrying the tattered
fcarmem in nor arms. The angry words
of the mother and the subsequent flight
of the younn lady are taken by their
friends to mean that something out of. the
ordinary has happened.
After the trouble between the mother
and daughter Ilc-ynolds. true to his role
as lover, took â some say stole â the girl
away and departed for the stage office,
whore arrangements were hastily made
for a conveyance to take them to San
Rafael in time to catch the 5:30 train for
Par. Francisco. With her baggage. Miss
Josie Garcia and Albert Reynolds, the
man of her choice, departed from Boli
ras at half-past 2 In the morning and
made the long journey over twenty-two
miles of the roughest mountain country
in this county.
It was a long ride and a ffist one, and
as the foamins horses and dust covered
ftage came Into the dopot In time for the
outgoing train more than one quiet citi
zen of this city asked himself "What's
up?"
Fince the time the young folks loft the
ftnee at tho San Rafael depot nothing is
known of their movements. Where they
went and how fortune has treated them
are questions to which dozens of their
lri'->nds wn-jld Hke to find an answer.
V. hr>n the young folks firÂ«t mot Rey
nolds was driving a s-tage at Olema. It
Is needless to say that since the ride
over Bolinas ridge the county knows him
rn more. Wherever fortune may send
him and the young lady, who by 'all tra
ditior.F of romance If now presumed to be
liis bride, it is= confidently predicted by
his friends that his two wiMIng hands
â¢will earn an honest living for himself and
the cirl of his choice. In the meantime
the young people will hrir.g comfort to

SANTA ROSA. July 6.â An unpleasant
affair marred to-day's programme at tre
race meet now being held In this city un
der the auspices of the Breeders' Asso
ciation. C. A. Durfee. the well-known
driver, became Involved In a dispute with
a groom by the name of Robert Thomp
son, better known as "Dusky Bob." and
while on the track In full view of (ha
spectators and judges, struck him a heavy
blow on the back of the bead with the
butt end of a whip, cutting? a bad gash.
Much excitement was created.
The trouble occurred during the last
race on the card, the 2:20 pace. Thomp
son 'was up behind Tou?hnut, George W.
Ford's entry. In place of J. C. Brooks,
the regular driver. Durfee had replaced
James Thompson, who had been sched
uled to drive Monica. It la claimed that
while away on the half "Dusky Bob"
struck Durfee's horse Beveral times across
the face with hl3 whip. At the finish
Durfee berated Thompson, whereupon the
latter became so abusive that Durfee
struck him. Thompson was taken into
town and the gash sewed up.
The Judges now have the matter under
consideration. The general opinion seems
to be that Durfee was as nearly Justified
as such conduct could be Justified on c
racecourse. He certainly had strong prov
ocation. Â¦ a
For to-morrow an especially fine card
has been arranged, some of the best
horses on the coast being entered.

come to a close. Summaries:

for a few weeks, until the next tournament at Del Monte ln August. Much talk
and argument is heard every day about the Fourth of July championship. The
general public was surprised at Sumner Hardy'9 defeat, knowing how well he
played at Del Monte, when he made Dwlght Davis hustle for five sets. But the
talent picked Whitney when the Collier-Hardy match was over, as Hardy had
all he could do to beat Collier 10-8 ln the second set. Whitney could at any
time in practice beat Collier easily 6-2. The tournament furnished several
more surprises-Hunt's defeat of Rob Whitney and Collier's defeat of Hunt.
Hunt and Whitney lost for the same reason. Thev both beat themselves by
their unsteadiness. O. Murdock ln his match with Hardy demonstrated the
fact that with good practice and training he might soon reach the first class.
This might also be said of Nicholson.
The Hardys will play In at least five tournaments and should make a good
showing, as their strokes are such as to be equally effective on grass or bitu
men. The Western double championship should be won by them, as there 13 no
team ln the Middle West to compare with the Eastern, and the Hardys proved
themselves equal to the best at Del Monte last September.
Four of the local players will visit the Santa Clara Club ln Santa Clara
shortly and play a round robin tournament, it is to be quite a social affair,
luncheon at noon and a dance at night. â¢
While in the East Sumner Hardy will write a series of tennis articles special

ON THE CRICKET FIELD.
The cricketers had an off day on July 4,
there being no game scheduled on the pro
gramme of the California Cricket Associa
tion, and the California* not being able
to get together a team and visit Santa
Cruz, where they had been invited by the
cricket club of the Santa Cruz Country
Club. To-morrow the Alameda eleven will
meet the Pacific team in the first of' the
lI ll r ir serlPS Â°f matches for <ihe pennant.
There will probably be no obstacle in
the way of making up a comblned^team to
visit Lake County during the Admission
day holidays. The secretary of the Cali
fornia Cricket Association has received
a communication from T. W. Beakbane,
secretary of the Bums Valley Cricket
Club, in which it is stated that the Burns
\ aJJey men will be pleased to play against
a city eleven on Sunday, September 9.
The Lakeport Cricket Club has already
promised to play on the 10th. and a Lake
County team will be made up from the
Burns V alley and LakeporJ; men to -play
on the 11th. The city players will leave
Ban Francisco on September 8, and if they
arrive too late to be taken by the Lower
Lake residents to their homes will spend
what remains of the night at the hotel.
They will, after playing three matches
r Â£ tur , n ,. t0 JL an F'nineisco on Wednesday
the 12th. There have been no matches be
tween San Francisco and Lake County
since 18S5, when a team of Lake County
men visited this city. The only basis for
a comparison of strength is the result of
the play against the Placer County eleven
in 1898. In that year the Lake County
"Within the past two weeks the cham
pions have made their greatest spurt of
the season, winning six out of seven
games. Notwithstanding the big lead the
other managers are still hopeful, for while
they acknowledge that the Sacramentos
are a strong aggregation, they feel that
luck has been with the champions. They
have won at least three games, one of
the last seven on errors of the most fla
grant an.l inopportune as well as of the
most costly character. Though the Fris
cos are still at the. tail end they have held
their own against every team except the
Sacramentos in all their recent meeting*.
And though they lost three straight to thn
champions they Rave a record of nine vic
tories out of the last sixteen games
played. They have lately been handi
cap'ped bv the absence of Reitz and Reilly.
but the latter Is in the game again, and
Reitz is expected to . participate in this
week's series. He has been sick at his
home in Sacramento.
Phil Knell has been signed by Harris
and is now In training. He expects to
Join the team in anrther week. Knell is
a clever south-paw twirler, and while in
the . East ' last year proved that his arm
had not lost its cunning. He refused to
go East this season, preferring to- remain
at home. He' Is not only a jrood pitcher
but he is an excellent run-getter as well
as a general utility fielder.

ABOUT THE BOATHOUSES.
Things are very quiet among the oars
men Just now. To-morrow the. Alameda
Boat Club will hold some races in out
rigger skiffs on Oakland Creek, with the
view of learning what material there is
among the new members. One or two of
the likely men will represent the club In
the championship regatta on September 9.
This is the event that all the rowing men
are looking forward. to, and as the regatta
committee of the semi-centennial celebra
tion of the Native Sons of the Golden
West is taking up the matter with enthu
siasm, and as valuable prizes will be of
fered, the regatta will doubtless be highly
successful.
The junior barge crew of the Ariel Row
ing Club is already in practice and the
club will probably enter several men for
the outrigger skiff ami shell champion
ships on September 9. Charles Wilson and
probaby William McCausland will enter
the race for the senior outrigger skiff
championship; while J. A. Geddes, W.
Horton and E. J. Lynch will try for the
junior championship. F. J. Kelly. will pull
in the junior shelf race and possibly J.
Wilson in the senior shell event.
The Dolphin Boating Club will hold a
ladies' day at its boathouse at the foot of
Van Ness avenue on Sunday, July 15, be
ginning at about 11 a. m. As Stanley Ad
derley Â¦will be away from town on a va

George Baker and W. O. Patch will not
take place, but Baker will row against
W. O. Patch for the outrigger skiff cham
pionship of the Dolphin Club.
NAUMAN BEATS WALSH.
C. C. Nauman beat P. J. "Walsh yester
day in a pigeon shooting match, 100 birds,
at the San Francisco Trap Shooting As
sociation grounds at Ingleside.
The match was for $100 a side at 23
yards. The winner was in fine form and
made an excellent showing, scoring 97
kills against his opponent's S6. Walsh
missed his first bird and lost his second
out of bounds. This seemed to worry him
and in the first 25 he missed 3 and lost 2.
In the second 25 he lost 1 and in the third
and fourth missed 3 and lost 1 in each.
Nauman missed but 2 birds in the match
and lost 1 dead out of bounds. He killed
his last 45 birds straight. Walsh had the
worst of the hard birds up to the seven
tieth Inning, and after that Nauman had
more than his share of them. Walsh
made a number of long kills, many of
them at 50 or CO yards. On some of these
he made some fine shots which seemed

WITH MEN OF THE WHEEL.
It is proposed to hold a cycling demon-
stration of considerable magnitude In this
city In September, during the days of the
Native Sons' celebration. Already steps
are being taken in this direction, and
Judge Frank H. Kerrigan has been ap
pointed chairman of the committee. It
has been suggested that this would be
a good opportunity to bring together all
the crack relay teams of the coast In a
fifty-mile race on the Ingleside track.
With teams from the Olympic and Bay
City , Wheelmen, Garden City, Sacra
mento, Stockton and Reno entered i the
race would be highly exciting, and this
plan is being worked at with this definite
object in view.
The route committee of the Cycle Path
Association will go over the ground be
tween Ingleside, the ocean boulevard and
Colma to-morrow, accompanied by City
Engineer Grunsky and A. B. Maguire, the
new member of the Board of Public
Works, with the object of selecting a de
sirable route.
The annual old-timers' run of the Bay
City Wheelmen will be held Sunday, July

The great subject of conversation
now among the owners of fine dogs is the
two big stakes, tho Futurity and the
John Grace challenge cup, which will be
run some time in October, instead of Feb
ruary. The second payment has been
made on 121 entries in the Futurity stake.
This will insure at least ninety-six nomi
nations and a purse of at least $1000 to
the winner. The aggregate purses of the
John Grace stake will reach a higher fig
ure than $60(1). D. E. Wiley has the honor
of making the first nomination â $50. He
will run the promising pup Buck, by Fly

piNE OUTLOOK
FOR COURSING
The second ar.nual competition for the
Prince Poniatowskl cup on the links of
the Burlingaxne Country Club on July 4
resulted in a victory for Miss Caro Crock
ett, who by three strokes defeated her
nearest competitor, Mrs. J. W. Bowers of
Garvanzaâ the winner of the first tourna
ment for the women's championship of
Southern California. Miss Alice Hoffman
Â¦winner of the Council's cups for women
of the San Francisco and San Rafael golf
clubs, and regarded as the strongest play
cr of her sex In San Francisco, made a
score of 124. This score Mrs. R. G. Brown
of the San Rafael Golf Club tied. Miss
Hoffman drove a longer ball than the
winner and made her first round of the
links in 5G, which would gi\-e a total of
112 for the eighteen holes, but on the sec
ond round she got badly bunkered, requir
ing CS strokes for the nine holes. The other
compe'itors were Miss Edith McBean,
Mrs. H. H. Sherwood. Mrs. F. E. Magee
and Mrs. Dunham. Tlie winner's victory
is doubtless to be attributed to her famil
iarity with the links, and to her successful
avoidance of the hazards. Her short
Â»?ame. moreover, was accurate. She will
be entitled to the possession of the trophy
until July 4. 1901.

In the California Yacht Club race on
the Fourth E. F. Sagar's sloop yacht
Edna won the Wallace trophy for the
third time in succession. In 1S0S she de
feated Commodore E. N. Walter's sloop
Embla by more than twelve minutes; last
year she finished more than half an hour
ahead of the yacht Embla; on July 4 she
defeated her nearest competitor, the sloop
Thelma, by 2 minutes and 4$ seconds, cor
rected time. The wind was rather light at
the start, but freshened out in the chan
nel. Edna crossed the starting line 2 min
utes" 53 seconds after the gun-fire of the
thirty-six-foot class at 1:30 p. m., but as
soon as sÂ»he got into a good breeze, went
to the front, with Thelma next. Edna
rounded the Presidio-shoal buoy 10 min
utes 15 seconds before Thelma. which was
followed by Pactolus and Gypsle. Edna
did not set her spinnaker on the run home
until she was past Melggs wharf, and oft
Goat Island took it in, setting it again,
however, later in the race. J. T. Carrier's
sloop Jessie E., which was regarded as
Edna's most dangerous competitor, sailed
very poorly, the substitution of a longer
bowsprit and the reduction of her main
sail making her slow. "When the Edna
had got past Goat Island on the return
home, she ran into a calm, and the rest
of the fleet almost overhauled her. She
got the wind, however, soon enough to
cross the finishing line off the Alameda
mole, a winner. E. F. Sagar sailed his
own boat, and had an excellent crew,
made up of H. W. Westerfeld. Frank
Thompson. "Jack" Short. J. C Brikell and
S. C. Delamater. The sloop Emma, with
Carl Westerfeld at the helm, cruised over
from TIburon as a pilot for the vice-com

Joe Wheeler, 2:07U, the sensational

While the Reiff brothers. Tod Sloan and
Rlpby receive almost daily notice for
their prominence in English racing- affairs,
no mention Is made of Ed Corrigan, the
Tanforan crusader. Neither does word,

York paper stated that Corrifran had
been refused a license by the racing stew

has probably not been lifted. If true, what
a crushing blow to the meek, modest, dig

Rumors from the other side of the hills
say California bookmakers chalking odds

Fred Cook and "Shorty" Pesch were
$20,000 to the bad.
So Frank Rutter. a prominent member
of the Armstrong family, has been given

F I MUl, second period of the fishing season, the time when the scaly lnhabl-
I tacts of sea and stream are easily brought from the waters to make the
I heart of the sportsman palpitate with joy. Is at hand. With the begin
ning of July, when the warm weather strikes the country, the best fish
ing: begins and the flycasters take first to their books and then to some chosen
stream where the trout abound.
Every train that leaves San Francisco these days carries with it a number
of the rod devotees. Reports from all over the State reach this city, indicating
that the fishermen are whipping rivers and streams wherever there Is a chance
for a catch.
The flshlag at Cisco during the week has afforded sport of the highest class.
A. S. Carman and Andrew Talbot of San Francisco have been getting big
catches. Mr. Carman averages about twenty-five trout of good quality each
evenlrg on the south fork of the Tuba River. There are also a number of
campers on the river who fish regularly.
"William Dickinson, a young angler, caught fifty trout fishing down stream
from Cascade six miles.
On Tuesday Mr. Carman and 2Ir. Talbot made a pilgrimage to the lake, an
hour and a half ride on horseback over the trails. Mr. Carman was quite suc
cessful. His first cast resulted in hooking a one and a half pound Mykiss, which
he landed after a game fipht on the part of the trout. Later In the day he se
cured another of identical weight. Nine of the Mykiss weighed five pounds. The
total catch was seventeen fish, of which four were Eastern brook trout weigh
ing a ha!f pound each. The lake was stocked on Tuesday with 25,030 trout
fry- It gives promise of becoming a noted resort for sportsmen, although it is
almost inaccessible now. It is still unnamed. It is a beautiful sheet of water
about a half mile In length and varying in width from 100 feet to a quarter of
a m!le.
The best reports come from the Truckee River and lake country- Return
ing fishermen pronounce the sport along the State line the best experienced in
years. John F. Siebe and Walter Carr fished the Truckee near Verdi last week.
In three days they killed seventy pounds of fish. Colonel Young returned from
Boca, and his report was equally bright.
"During the early part of the week a gloom settled over the fishermen at
Santa Cruz" is what Dr. C. G. Levison has to say about the fishing in that
bay. Everybody is waiting patiently for an Improvement, The doctor captured
a twenty-pound codfish.
Lake San Andreas will open on July 15. Then there will be a rush of rod
wielders to this placeâ those who cannot get far away from the city for their
EjÂ»ort.

OWNERS of property in Chinatown are re
ported to be much aggrieved by the demand
that their property shall be subject to sanitary
inspection and regulation as are buildings in other
parts of the city. It is said they have suffered a good
deal by the quarantine imposed by the bubonic Board
of Health, and are now in a fit humor to fight any
attempt on the part of the authorities to compel them
to put their Chinatown houses in good order and keep
them so.
If these reports be tiue, the public will watch with
considerable interest to see in what form the fight
against improvement is to be made. The sanitary
laws of the city are plain in their terms; they are per
fectly valid; they apply to the Chinese quarter as well
as to other districts 'of the municipality, and the city
officials are in duty bound to enforce them impartially,
flow, then, can the irate owners of foul buildings
n:ake a fight with any profit to themselves? What
have they to gain by persisting in a violation of ths
ordinances of the municipality instead of promptly
conforming to them?
If the owners of Chinatown property will con
sider the situation with an intelligent under
standing of its various features, they will per
ceive that a fight against, the health ordinances
would be a fight against their own inter
ests. For example: It appears from '" their . own
showing that they have lost heavily by reason of the
bubonic quarantine; but the quarantine was brought
about solely by the filthy condition of most of the-
Chinatown buildings. Had the sanitary laws been en
forced in the past there would never have been a
quarantine, for there would have been nothing on
which even so blundering a body as the bubonic
board would have dared to base it. That much even
the most irate property-owner must admit without
further argument. It is, in fact, self-evident.
What has happened once is always likely to happen
again if the same conditions continue. An unsanitary
Chinatown gave excuse for quarantines in the past
and it will serve as an excuse for other quarantines'
It wouk >e, therefore, no more than an act of intelli
gent self-interest on the part of those who have suf
fered by the quarantine to take such action as is cal
culated to prevent a repetition of the loss.
There arc. moreover, other advantages to be gained
by the owners of Chinatown* property in cordially co
operating with the authorities in enforcing the law
The property in the district has depreciated in value
FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.
WS. WITHAM of Georgia is one of the fore
most business men of the South. Indeed he
â¢ is one of the enterprising men whom the na
tion as a whole is proud to regard as typically Ameri
can, for he believes in progress and has the energy
and the, sagacity to carry out his belief by actions that
are beneficial to thousands of people. He is president
of thirty-two banks in Georgia, is owner of nine cot
ton mills, and is interested in many other industrial
institutions of the State. By reason of his widespread
business connections he is brought into relation with
all classes of the thrifty people of Georgia, and :s
therefore well fitted to speak for them in matters that
affect their material welfare. â¢>
He has been recently interviewed on the trend of
political sentiment in the South, and his statements
can be read with instruction as well as with interest.
He began by saying his practice has been that of
voting like a good citizen and keeping track of po
litical matters so far as they affect business." He de
clares the Southern people, notwithstanding their
Democratic affiliations, desire the re-election of Mc-
Kinley, and when asked why answered: "We know
when we are well off. We are not fools down South.
If everything is going well we don't want to risk any
change. There is great prosperity through the South
and it has come with this administration. We've had
8-cent cotton. Do you realize what that means to our
people down there? Well, it doubled the deposits in
my thirty-two banks. That's one thing it did. And
this year cotton will open at 10 cents. That's the sort
of business conditions that we appreciate in the South.
And the business men don't want any change that will
tisk that prosperity. That's the feeling among all
classes. McKinley stands for the prosperity that the
Republican party has brought in. The business men
are for McKinley becatise'.he totes fair and makes
good- business."
The Southern States will give their electoral votes
for Bryan solely because the business men v of the
South are sure 'McKinley will be* elected anyhow.
.Were the issue a matter of doubt there would be an
active and powerful McKinley party in every # South
ern State, and more than one of them would'cast its
vote for him. Even as it is Mr. Witham estimates
that the Bryan vote in the South this year will be
one-third less than it was in 1896.
Whatever may be put forward during the campaign
by the oratory of the Bryanite" party, the dominant
issue in the minds of the people is going to be that
of prosperity. The voters of the country are not
fools. They know when they are well off and they
are going to vote 'for McKinley because, as they sav
in Georgia. "He totes fair "and makes good business."
PROSPERITY fJS AN ISSUE.
The Portland Telegram has had such a high degree
of. prosperity during the past year that it has been
able Jo make a showing of 32,000 more inches of dis
jlay advertisement; than in the year ending July
1, 1899. That record speaks as well for the business
of the community as for the paper that serves it, and
accordingly congratulations are due to all Portland
as well as to Editor Owen.
The employes of the Board of Health who are re
belling against the order of dismissal are evidently
adverse to a sacrifice of that public snap which their
superiors have made notorious in the public mind.

gunboats and ordered the Governor to
make reparation and punish all persona
engaged in the attack. The demands as
to reparation was complied with and sev
eral of the leaders were beheaded. The
quiet which followed did not last long.
JCor soon after there was a plot to mur
der every foreiRner in China. There was
an attack all along the line from Nan
king to Tientsin. In June of that year
attacks were made on convents and for
eign legations and many persons were
murdered. France demanded an Investi
gation, which resulted In the execution of
sixteen Chinese and the exiling of two
mandarins In October. The leading offi
cials who took part in the many out
rageous crimes went unpunished.
CHINESE PHILOSOPHY.
THE thinking men of the world may well profit
by reflecting upon the statement of the Chinese
merchant who acknowledges himself a Boxer.
He declares that China long. ago underwent the ex
treme development of civilization which is still in
process in the Western world. There was the same
feverish pursuit of wealth and power; the same mar
tial and missionary spirit; the same war of class upon
clasi-, that may now be seen throughout the Occident.
Then from the?? extremes the race recoiled and re
traced its steps to a happy medium, and there im
movably planted its feet and founded its enduring in
stitution-. According to this China, instead of being
a case of arrested development, is an instance of ex
periment Kith the extreme of development and th-3
canceling out of life all elements not necessary to its
support ar.il its happiness. {
That what this Boxer says is true may be regarded
us hiphly probabie. The criticisms of Confucius couid
not have been directed at the China o! to-day. Like
aii prophets and reformers, he assailed the selfishness
end corruption of luxury, the lust of power, the c\ils
of a highly organized society in which wealth had be
coir.e an dement of iveskness. And like all reformers,
loo. he died scci;:s no impression made by his phil
osophy upor. tiie people he r-ttempted to redeem. The
dsy of hi> death he cried out in bitterness: "No
I'rirjce will employ tny instruction. None listens to
me. The tall mountain must some time be as ths
plain, and the stout oak must bend. So cometh my
time." Aside from the evidence furnished by the life
of Confucius â or, in the language of his country.
Kur.: r -iyt-se, Kung, the Wiseâ archaeology gives tes
timony to the wide stretch of Chinese power so re
mote that history known it not. Far down below the
foundation of the Troy of Priam modern excavations
have found buried the bones of a Chinese city. Orna

ncfe'ori^iti. prove that the vast empire reached there
Lcfore the first Egyptian dynasty ruled, before Persia
was, -nd probably the Eastern bight of the Mediter
ranean was not its frontier. Remains of the race arc
found in Ir.dia. Burmak and Siberia. All these things
indicate a time when China was to the world what
Assyria and Roive were in later ages.
One may well ad:r.:t that an empire that stretched
from the Yellow Sea to the Bosphorus must have ex
celled in civilization, and must have drained the cup
of experience from :he froth to the dregs. The
swarming of that race under Genghis Khan, and later
tjnder TiiiTQur. was nothing: more than the survival in
it of the spirit of conquest and love of power de
scended from the remote pr.st when it was the Colos-

the great American soldier was on nl3
journey around the world. After he na-l
gone Li Hung Chang. In making somÂ«
comparisons, said: ''General Grant and I
have suppressed the two greatest rebel
lions known in history." He referred, on
his own part, to the great Tal-Ping rebel
lion, probably the greatest uprising of its
kind known to the world.
When the great Chinaman was In New
York he was entertained by Mayor Strong.
During his Interview Li asked the Mayor
why he had not taken part In the civil
war. The Mayor replied that his brother
had been In the army, but that he haO,
stayed at home to take care of the fam
ily, and was in civil life. "Ah," said LI.
"you were a verv good soldier in time or
peace. I suppose." and a very good civilian
in time of war."
At another time he was discussing gov
ernments'and said: "Five thousand years
ago China was a republic Just as tho
United States is to-day."
"What made you change your form of
government?" he was asked.
"The change," he said, "was the most
gradual In the world % and our first em
peror was a plowboy."
When he was In England he uttered an
aphorism, the result of a short acquain
tance with the two gentlemen concerned
In it It was as follows: "Your Lord
Salisbury Is a man who says little and
means much. Your Mr. Gladstone is a
man who says much and means little."
When Li was In Germany the Kalw
asked him. "How do our women compare
with those of China?"
"I really cannot tell." said Li. s!yly.

Li Huhg Unique Personality.
SHE most eminent Chinaman in Chi
naâLi Hung Changâ is pure Chinese
in descent. This may sound like
saying that truth is truth, but, as
a matter of fact, the rulers of China
are Manchus and Tartars, and not China
men at all.
Li Hung Chang's success, aside from
his Intellectual gifts, which are great, is
perhaps partly due to his great stature,
six feet two inches, a height seldom
reached by Chinamen, and by his ability
to raise a heavier beard than usual In a
country where" the beard is the only pos
session of the white man that the China
man envies him.
Li's person Is large and bulky, and when
he was a young man he must have pos
sessed remarkable physical strength.
Even in his old age he carries himself in
a manner that shows plenty of reserve
strength; his bearing is soldierly, alert
and imposing. His eyes are large and
black, their penetrating quality veiled by
long lids when he wishes to conceal that
which they might possibly betray. His
skin is a deep yellow, very much wrinkled.
He wears a heavy white mustache and
Imperial. His cheeks still have color In
them in spite of his age. due partly to his
correct habits and good digestion, for he
is very abstemious, and to applications of
electricity for the relief of partial facial
scfbrlety of LI Hung Chang Is pro
verbial. Of all the charms of life that al
lure other men, he cares only for power,
and disdains thac which is simply pleas
ure In his own philosophical way he
savs: "Flowery paths arc not long. In
conversation he is either quietly and stu
diously polite and deferential, or brutally
and vehemently frank, as best suits his
ends. His most characteristic qualities
are Inflexible purpose and the courage of
his convictions.
When LI Hung Chang rises he goes to
work, and at 7 o'clock eats a breakfast
composed of birds' nest soup, rice congee
and coffee without milk or sugar. At the
close of the meal he takes a grain or two
of quinine and goes to work again.
Li Hung Chang has always been thrifty
and has taken advantage of his great op
portunities to make money. It has been
said that he is the richest man in the
world, but of that no one knows, as Li
has not divulged his financial status.
However, he practically owns the rail
roads and telegraph lines in China, which
he put In on his own responsibility and at
his own expense, and derives the revenue
from them. He Is behind every progres
sive European innovation Introduced into
the country, and, while hi3 motto is
"China for the Chinese," he is not averse
to using the foreigner and the good things
the foreigner can provide.
In no country is the short, pithy proverb
more valued than in China. The fashion
was set by Confucius, founder of Chines.?
philosophy, who habitually spoke In pro
verbs. Li Hung Chang Is known to the
Occident chiefly by reason of his genius
as a soldier and statesman, but besides
these he is a philosopher and retailer of
proverbs and apothegms of no mean or
der. During his memorable trip around
the world he continually surprised Euro
peans and Americans by his witty and apt
sayings, as well as by his abrupt ques
tions, both pertinent and otherwise.
Many years ago ne laid down a policy
for the treatment of foreigners which has
become universal In both China and Ja
pan. It is: "Let us use foreigners, but do
not let foreigners use us."
He admired General U. S. Grant and
THE TAX-SHIRKERS AT BAY.
BY an order of the United States Treasury De
partment all public officers are notified to see to
it when shipping money by the United States
Express Company that each receipt issued for a ship
ment be stamped in accordance with the war revenue
act by and at the expense of the company. This order
brings the tax-shirkers to a stand. They are now at
bay, and it remains to be seen whether they will make
against the Government the fight they have so long
made against the people.
What is fair for ths Government is fair for private
citizens. If under the law the express companies are
required to affix at their own expense the revenue
stamps upon receipts given for shipments by the of
ficers of the Government, they are also required to
affix the stamp when shipments are made by indi
viduals. The order of the Treasury Department
shows that the Government takes the same view of
the revenue act that has been taken by the people.
The Government is powerful and can enforce its or
der. To that extent at least the tax-shirking of the
express companies will be stopped.
This action on the part of the Federal Government
impo?C5 upon the Attorney General of California the
duty of taking steps at once to put an end to the tax
shirking here. That duty can be fulfilled by bringing
an action against the express company and compelling
its officers to submit their books in open court in or
der that it may be determined whether the -war rev
enue tax would amount to an unjust imposition upon
the business. If the Attorney General will do his duty
in this respect there is ample reason to believe the
fraudulent tax-shirking of the express company will
be stopped in this State, however extensively it may
be continued elsewhere.
The issue is up to the Attorney General. The peo
ple of Califorriia will wait with impatience to see what
action he purposes to take. The Federal Treasury
Department has set an example for him to follow. He
cannot indeed imitate it by issuing a summary order
requiring the express companies to affix stamps at
their own expense to all shipping receipts, but he
can force them to .come into court, and submit their
books for inspection! The claim made' by the express
managers that the tax would be confiscatory and
ruinous to their business is generally believed to be
a false pretense and a fraudulent statement. If that be
lief be wrong the express company is entitled to a day
in court in order that it may prove its honesty. If, on
the other hand, the belief be well founded, then the
company should be exposed in open court and its tax
shirking schemes baffled and beaten.

cratic party,- and now if Bryan should wish a mate to

where to look for him.

A POLITICAL DAY.
DURING the Revolution the people of the
Thirteen Colonies had on hand too much sad
and serious business to permit much attention
i to the anniversary of the assertion of their right to
I independence.
Doubtless the long and uneven struggle, with its
! increasing sacrifice of life and cost in treasure,
\ caused many an American to question, sometimes,
I the wisdom of the company in Philadelphia, who
I burned the bridges behind them by signing the
! "Unanimous Declaration." In those days it was not
j called the Declaration of Independence, but was con
j sidcred to be exactly in the nature of a declaration of
j war, stating the reasons for an armed conflict and lay-
ing down the principles to be established by it.
After the war ended and the inalienable right to in
dependence had been established by the sword, the
; historic document ceased to be regarded as a declara
! tion of war, and, in the spirit of the institutions
founded upon it, came to be known as the Declara-
; tion of Independence. Then no man doubted the
â¢ wisdom and foresight of its signers, and the reverence
I felt for them has come to be attached to their de
| scendants, whose lineage comes as near being a
! patent of nobility as anything existing under our in
; stitutions.
i The- original Declaration, long exposed in the li
; brary of the State Department at Washington, has
| faded until scarcely. legible, and is now kept under
1 lock and key in a cabinet. Though its phrases have
i paled and nearly lost their identity, and the signa-
I turcs may be read with difficulty, he is a dull spirited
I American who can look upon that yellow sheet of
! parchment, the scripture of the civil liberty of all
| men, and not thrill when he thinks of the living
! hands that crossed it in making signatures which
\ might have been the death sentence of the signers."
All Americans have joined in celebrating the anni
versary of that heroic act. By common consent no
ether interest, no other sentiment, no other act, has
been permitted to overlap it. Great actions have il
luminated our subsequent history. Great battles have
been fought even on that anniversary, but nothing
has been permitted to divide interest with the original
event, which is set among the greatest things in the
history of man. The annual celebration of the day
has been used wholly in contemplation of the charac
ters of the men who gave the Declaration to man
kind, and in tracing the mighty issues of that day's
act.
It remained for the Bryan Democracy to attempt to
divert the day to a partisan purpose, to make it a
partisan anniversary, to try and put into the great
company of heroes who made it a crowd of rheumy
e3ed politicians, in the hope that this desecration will
pick up a few votes.
It has been discovered that many dignified ancient
parchments have been written upon repeatedly. The
original inscription, being the oldest and therefore,
if for no other reason, the most valuable and impor
tant, is erased by some means and another is written
on top of it This second one may meet the same fate
as the first, and in its turn be scoured off and some
thing take its place. When such parchments are
found modern science has the means by which each
inscription may be read, from the last to the first,
like turning the leaves of a book. Such a parchment
is called a. palimpsest. Colonel Bryan and his fol
lowers arc trying, in effect, to make a palimpsest out
of the Fourth of July. By a supcrimposition of their
small personalities and their feculent partisanship
upon the day they attempt to use the great signers as
an underground upon which to inscribe themselves.
It is as if they had abstracted the immortal parch
ment from the cabinet where it lies in the State De
partment and had written over it the Chicago plat
form, making a palimpsest of the document itself.
We predict that th:s attempt to give a partisan sig
nificance to the day will fail. There are some things
the people will not permit. They will not put these
modern Don Quixotes in place of the ancient knights
in our crusade for liberty.
The day will be pursed of the desecration and the
people will keep in touch with its original and hal
lowed purpose.
because the locality is kept in a foul and pestilential
condition. It would be useless for one or two own
ers to improve their buildings while all around them
is the contamination of a thousand abominations. As
individuals, therefore, they can do little for the im
provement of the value of their property, but if the
law be enforced impartially and the whole district be
cleaned there will be a general benefit' to every
property-owner in it.
These matters should be carefully considered by the
property-owners before they engage lawyers and en
tei upon a costly struggle to defeat the law and main
tain their buildings in the present condition. It will
be money in their pockets to avoid the contest. It
will cost them in the end about as much to hire law
yers for a prolonged struggle ,as it would to clean' up
their property; and in the end the money paid to
the lawyers would be wasted", for the Chinatown dis
trict is going to be cleaned up, the health ordinances
are to be enforced there. Upon that the people of San
Francisco are resolved.

The eyes of all the Foreign Devils are
The earth Is getting dry:
This is because the churches stop the
heaven.
The Gods are angry.
The Genii are vexed;
Both are come down from the mountains
to deliver the doctrine.
This is not hearsay.
The practice will not be In vain
To recite incantations and pronounce

Burn up the yellow written prayers:
Light incense sticks;
To invite the Gods and Genii of all the

The Gods will come out of the grottoes.
The Genii will come down from the
mountains.
And support the human bodies to prac
tice the boxing.
When all the military accomplishments

Are fully learned.
It will not be difficult to exterminate
the "Foreign Devils" then.
Push aside the railway tracks.
Pull out the telegraph polra.
Immediately after this destroy the

The great France
Will grow cold and down-hearted;
The English and Russian will certainly
disperse.
Let the various "Foreign Devils" all be
killed.
May the whole elegant Kmpire of the
Great Chlng dynasty be ever pros
perous.

culated largely in Hoo-Xan ten years ago
and led to the serious i riots of that pe
riod.
"At the present time." he continues,
"we are having a not dissimilar, if less
violent, recrudescence of anti-foreign lit
erature, of which the, following are very
good samples. The first of them Is in
rhyme of a peculiarly attractive form, the
meter throughout representing two lines
of three characters each, and one line of
seven characters. This is particularly
easy to memorize. I know some Chinese
Christians whose families can repeat it
by. heart after one or two readings, and
they assure me thafit Is a style of pla
card which would be universally memor
ized, whereas the prose placards are read,
but make no lasting impression. I ap
pend a literal translation of the poem
without any attempt at rhyme, for fear of
destroying the effect:
Gods assist the Boxers,
The Patriotic Harmonious Corps;
It Is Because the Foreign Devils dis
turb the Middle Kingdom.
Urging the people to Join their religion.
To turn their backs on Heaven;
Venerate not the Gods and forget the

Lord Roberts telegraphed to the War
Office under date of Pretoria, July 6, 2:26
p. m., as follows:
"Paget engaged the enemy on July 3
successfully at Pleiserfontein. He drove
them out of a very strong position across
Leeuwkop to Bronerifonteln, where he
bivouacked for the night. He followed
up the enemy on the afternoon of July 4,
who were at Blaauw Kop, fifteen miles
northwest of Bethlehem. He reports that
all of Steyn's Government officials, except
the Treasurer General, who has gone to
Vrede, are at Bethlehem, which has been
proclaimed the capital. Steyn himself is
reported to have taken flight to the moun

"Buller reports the line to Heidelberg

overthrown in the great Issues dominat
ing the 1S96 convention. Now, they had
a complete organization.
The matter of selecting the executive
committee was left to Chairman Jones. It
is understood that many of the members
of the last committee will be chosen.
A committee consisting of Tillman' of
South Carolina, Johnson of Indiana. Wil
liams of Massachusetts. Osborne of Wy
oming and Wilson of Idaho, was appoint
ed to confer with representatives of the

Mr. Belmont Says the Work
of the Kansas City Con
vention Will Be Satisfac
tory to All Democrats.
By OLIVER H. P. BELMONT.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, KANSAS
CITY, July 6.â Of all national con
ventions that were ever held this
has probably been the greatest. The
mere mention of the name of Bryan
has made the people wildly enthusiastic.
It Is the most magnetic name that can be
mentioned. Of course, the greatest dem
onstration was made when Air. Bryan was
nominated, and who could fail to wonder
and be deeply impressed by the wild en
thusiasm of the spectators. 13ryan has had
hold of the convention from the opening
bang of the chairman's gavel to the last.
Now that the convention has adjourned
It can be said with truth that what was
done, both in regard to the platform and
nominee, is wonderfully satisfactory to
everybody. Whatever differences any of
the delegates may have had they have
locked them up In their breasts, and have
apparently forgotten them and they 'will
choerfully abide by the conclusion of the
convention. Everything has passed off
smoothly and nicely. Even the weather
for the last few days has been all that
could have been wished for. The New
York delegation will go back home filled
with enthusiasm and with a determina
tion to win the fight In the State.
The result of the November election will
certainly place New York In the list of
Democratic States. Also we will find in
the same column, safely Democratic, the
great States of Illinois and Indiana. The
declaration making Imperialism the para
mount issue will find great favor in the
East, as will also the plank sympathizing
with the struggling Boers. The ticket is
the best one that could have been made,
and will assuredly meet with success in
November.
JONES CHOSEN TO
SUCCEED HIMSELF
KANSAS CITT, July G.â The new na
tional committee of the Democratic party
met at the Kansas* City Club. Senator
Jones, who was not a member of the com
mittee, remained outside until the prelim-
POPULISTS MAY
STAND BY TOWNE
Three-PartB Conference Falls
to Bring About His immecLl
* ate Withdrawal.
KANSAS CITY, July 6.â A protracted
meeting of the conference committees of
the Democratic, Populist and Silver Re
publican parties was held at Lyceum Hall
to-night, av which the Vice Presidential
situation was discussed, with a view to
bringing about. If possible, an agreement
between the three parties. The members
of the Democratic committee urged the
Populist and Silver Republican represent
atives to use their influence In uniting
their parties in support of Bryan and Ste
venson. â¢ '
"The Democrats all over the country,"
raid Commltteeman Johnson, turning to
the Populists, "know that Mr. Bryan is
your kind of a man.. If the two parties
were to unite and factions arose,
every Democrat knows that Mr. Bryan
would be found with our party. Demo
crats felt that the nomination of Mr.
Bryan was In deference to the more radi
cal reform element of the party, and that
a selection should be made for Vice Presi
dent to hold the conservatives. This
brought Mr. Stevenson's nomination.
There was a time that Mr. Towne had a
Ehow of success."
The conference of the representatives of
the three parties developed a peculiar sit
uation In some respects. The Democrats
were anxious for the withdrawal of
Towne from the Populist ticket, and the
Silver Republicans said as far as they
were concerned thjy would, through their
committee, nominate Stevenson for Vice
President, although profoundly disap
pointed that Towne was not named by
Affable Passengerâ Indeed, and you are

Music Hall Artist (regretfully)â And
I'm. certain, guv-nor. It's twenty years
Finer- I was in a bank.â Moonshine.
"From what I have read I can see that
It Is a cunningly devised scheme to catch
the unwary and the unthinking voters. I
think the most labored effort in their
document was to create a difference be
tween expansion and Imperialism. It Is
rather amusing to see their line of demar
cation; they apparently rely upon the con
stitutional question to establish that
difference as to whether the flag follows
the constitution or the constitution fol
lows the flag. "We are perfectly willing
to meet that issue on their hypothesis. So
far as the free silver plank is concerned,
I think all Republicans will be satisfied. It
is certainly satisfactory to me."
CLEVELAND, July 6.â Senator Hanna,
asked for an expression on the Demo
cratic platform, said:
HANNA PLEASED
WITH PLATFORM
the E>emocratic convention. The Popu
lists w^re not in favor of the withdrawal
of Towne and maintained that the Popu
list National Committee, acting under in
structions of the Sioux Falls convention,
would be compelled to put another candi
date in the Held if Towne should with
draw, and that the committee could not
withdraw him. More than this, they as
serted that if Towne should be with
drawn and they should not put another
man in his place, their organization
would be endangered, and such action
would result in the Populists going over
to the middle-of-the-road ticket nominat
ed at Cincinnati. This would lessen the
chances of carrying States in the West
and intermountuln country.
It was also said that Mr. Bryan had
been apprised of the situation and that
several men had received word from him
to keep Towne in the field and to run a
double-tailed ticket in order to hold the
Populist and Silver Republicans in the
Western States. The fact that a number
of United States Senatorships depended
upon the success of the fusion of all
forces was given as a reason why the
Populist ticket should be kept in the field.
It was claimed by the Populists that two
Senators in Nebraska, one in South Da
kota, one in Kansas, one in Colorado and
possibly one in Wyoming depended upon
perfect fusion of the three forces.
The Populists made a plea for flelay,
saying that thirty days from now they
would have an opportunity to confer with
their people, and the conditions which
might make necessary the withdrawal of
Towne or his retention would be then
better understood. When the conference
broke up no conclusion had been reached.
A meeting of the Silver Republican
National Committee was held immediately
after the close of the conference and at
the end of a brief discussion it was voted
unanimously to place Adlai E. Stevenson
In nomination for Vice President and to
co-operate in every way with the Demo
cratic party for the success of the ticket.
The Populist committee met afterward,
and after a somewhat torrid discussion,
decided to take no action until after Mr.
Towne shall have had a conference with
Mr. Bryan. Mr. Towne "Mil leave for Lin
coln to-morrow.
and placed Abraham W. Patrick In nomi
nation. Ex-Congressman William H.
Hnowden of Pennsylvania pledged his
State to Stevenson. He talked so long,
however, that the audience drowned his
peroration in derisive cheers. .
Texas, Utah and Vermont- responded in
a similar manner, all seconding Steven
son's nomination. The spectators greeted
them with cheers and seemed inspired
with new hope when John W. St. Clair
of West Virginia took the. platform and
began to talk like an electrified revivalist
preacher. This created another infernal
uproar and his words were lost in the
confusion. It is understood that he sec
onded Stevenson's nomination.
Perfect Human Calliope.
Wisconsin sent up William Cooper, who
started off like a frightened rabbit. Ho
was a perfect human calliope, and as hb
subsided there were loud cries of "amen."
He was for Towne.
A delegate in the Wisconsin section re
plied that twenty-two of her sons were
for Stevenpon.
Arizona turned into the same path and
Prince David from Hawaii, with the un
pronounceable name, followed. John H.
Wise, his colleague, proclaimed himsell
for Hill. These announcements were
made from their seats in the hall.
Alaska tried to stem the tide by taking
the platform. Her representatives walked
backward and forward and were literally
hissed off the stage. This was the last
Territory called. J. Hamilton Lewis, car.
rying a 'straw hat, picturesque in appear
ance and picturesque in elegance, then
appeared at the desk and withdrew his
name from the list of candidates. There
was no interruption, and he was applaud
ed to the echo as he thanked his friends
and retired. , , ,
A ballot was then taken. It was quickly
evident that Stevenson was polling nearly
two-thirds of the votes. Hill had nearly
200 votes and Towne 85.
Tennessee nominated Stevenson by
changing her 24 votes for HilH Alabama
followed, and the different State delega
tions tumbled over each other in their ef
forts to be enrolled in the Illinois column.
There were loud cheers when Minnesota
renounced her claims, but they were in
creased tenfold when New York an
nounced her acceptance of the nominee.
At the conclusion of the changes the
chair said that Adlai Stevenson had been
unanimously nominated as the candidate
of the Democracy for the Vice Presidency.
The convention roared like an ocean In a
tornado, and the ticket was Placed be
fore the American people for their In
dorsement. ":Â¦"..;.

CANTON. O.. July 6.â The home city of
the President to-day aceorcUd to his col
!â¢ ayue on ihe Republican National ticket
an ovation almost unprecedented even In
Canton. It would be hard to say whether
the citizens of Canton voiced a more dem
onstrative welcome to President McKinley
or Governor Roosevelt, yet it may be said
with truth that Canton did not discrim
inate in to-day's demonstration, the first
occasion on which the Republican candi
dates for President and Vice President
personally met since the Philadelphia con
vention. Governor Roosevelt arrived in
Canton over the Valley Road at half past
E. His only companions from Cleveland to
Canton were the newspaper men who
have accompanied him on his lor.g trip to
Oklahoma. As the Governor alighted
from the train whistles blew and cannon
Loomed and an immense crowd gathered
about the station and gave him a mighty
cheer of welcome.
The President's secretary. George B.
Cortelyou was the lirst person to meet
bUa as be stepped from the platform.
Carriapc-s were in waiting. All alcng the
lir.i- irvm the stiitioa to the McKinley res
idence, nearly a miie, tl.e streets were
lined with people, and Governor Roosevelt
was kept Â«.Â»usy bowing his acknowledg
ments to the acclaims of the people of
Canton. A brass band played patriotic
airs and led the procession. The carriage
In Which Roos-.'velt rode was surrounded
by small boy.? shouting at the highest
pitch of their" voices, and bicyclists, who

Rough Rider. The yard of the McKinley
residence and the streets a.ijaccnt were
Literally packed with humanity when the
Governor alighted from his carriage and
walked briskly toward the house. Then a
tremendous cht^r burst forth from the
assemblage. President McKinley was
standing on the porch waiting with out-
Etretched hands to greet his associate on
the national ticket.
Whm they shook hands the scene was
inspiring indetd. The assemblage was
clamorous for speeches, and when some
thing like quiet was restored the President
Introduced Governor Roosevelt in the fol
io wing words:
"1 cannot express the pleasure it has
given me to s>ee the enthusiastic wel
come my fellow citizens have given to
Governor Roosevelt, and also the pleas
ure of presenting him to you."
The Governor spoke by a few words,
but hi6 voice rang clear and loud and the
great crowd had no difficulty in hearing
iilm. He said:
"My fellow citizens: I thank you most
cordially for the way you have come for
ward to greet me. I know that none of
jou, least of all my old comrades here,
will grudge me in saying that I thank par
ticularly those who wear the buttons that
show they fought in the great war. *Ap
jjlausej
"1 cannot say how I appreciate this,
coming- as it does from the townsmen of
the President, who is now in a peculiar
tense my loader, and whom I shall fol
lÂ«.w and" support with every ounce of
sarengih that there is in me. And. at
least, there is to be said for our side
that we know what tve believe. In Kan-
M s City they have had a little difficulty
In finding out what they believe. I see
!>y the papers that they had some diffi
culty, extending finally to a vote of 27 to
25, in pitting in free silver. Now. we be
lieve with iui our faith in a dollar worth
a hundred cents. Apparently they have
E2 per cent of faith in a 4S-cent dollar. I
do not intend to do mere this afternoon
than to apain thar.k you most cordially.
and to say that I appreciate what this
greeting: mcar.s. coming as it does from
the home of the President.
â¢â¢I shall try to show myst-lf not wholly
unworthy of" the way in which you have
met me this afternoon."
The President and the Governor then
Tetired into the house, but the crowd was
not satisfied. The demand? for McKin
lev were so persistent that at length he
stepped out again upon the porch. A
gnat cheer vent up. which he silenced
with a wave of his hand.
"I only appear," said the President,
"that I may fay to you that I am going
to be with you most of the summer."
Cheers arid laughter followed this re
mark of the President and the crowd soon
liroke up. At dinner the only puests at
The McKinley residence besides the regu
lar household were Governor Roosevelt
and Judge and Mrs. Day. President Me-
Kin!ey and Governor Roosevelt were in
conference most of the evenine. but noth
itipr could be learned as to the matters
dipcusp^.
The Governor left for New York at
1:50.
"I am colng: direct to Oyster Bay to
morrow afternoon." he said, "and we are
pning to have some fireworks, a sort of
brlair-d Fourth of July celebration."
Governor Roosevelt refused to discuss
tho Kansas City platform or the candi
dates.

CHICAGO, July 6.-A special to the
Record from Canton, Ohio, says: A
statement made by Judge "William R.
Day, president of the Paris Peace Com
mission and former Secretary of State, In
his address here at the celebration of In
dependence day, has been construed by
many to mean that the United States
Government held Spain responsible for the
blowing up of the battleship Maine.
The following is the. paragraph in ques
tion: "In the realm of international law
we have set a ntw and high example to
the nations of the earth. Enduring, un
til patience ceased to be a virtue, {he
cries of an oppressed people, observing
the obligations of neutrality until organ
ized tyranny and oppression culminated
In wanton treachery and the destruction
of an American vessel and an American
crew in a harbor where they had a right
to be secure, the Americaji nation de
manded, not vengeance or pecuniary in
demnity, but the termination of a sov
ereignty which made such a condition
possible. And then came a national up
rising, not of section against section, but
of all the country."
When questioned to-day about the para
graph Judge Day said he meant in hia
speech just what the words said. Asked
for a direct statement whether the Gov
ernment did not regard Spain as the
party resposible for the destruction of
the. Maine, he repeated that the words of
Wednesday's address meant nothing more
nor less than they read. He gave the fol
lowing additional statement on the ques
tion:
"I do not think it requires elabora
tion. As was well known, the destruction
of the Maine was one of the causes that
led to the war. Undoubtedly while an
chored at a pier chosen by Spanish offi
cials the Maine was blown up by the ex
plosion of a mine outside of the vessel.
Just who did this has never been demon
etrated, so far as I know. It must have
been by some one who knew the location
of the mine and had access to the means
by which It was exploded."
Judge Day then quoted a statement
from the protocol.
In a Fourth of July Speech He Out

Direct Statement Made by
Former Secretary of
State Day.
The United States transport Rosecrans
had a lively time of it in the ice while on
the way to Nome. She went from here to
Seattle, where she took aboard two com
panies of the Seventh Infantry, In com
mand of Major Van Arsdale, twenty me
chanics, nineteen longshoremen, 800,000
feet of lumber, a large quantity of com
missary stores and some general mer
chandise for the new post to be estab
lished by the army authorities at Nome.
Leaving Seattle on June 2 the Rosecrans
made good progress until June 15, when
6he went on a sand bar off the coast half
way between St. Michael and Nome,
where she remained three days. Nearly
all the lumber and supplies were light
ered Into the boats before the Meteor
towed the transport off. and these 'got lost
In the tog and may never be heard from
again.
A graphic running account of the
trouble on the Rosecrans arrived from
Dutch Harbor yesterday. The writer says:
Early in the morning of June 10 we ran Into
a heavy fog bank. We came to anchor about
10 p- m. and lay there until the morning of tha
14th, when, to the delight of every one on
board, the heavy fog which had been hang-
Ing over ui for three days lifted, and at 2:30
a. m. the anchor was taken In and we again
started on our trip northward.
The sun faas beer, shining brightly since 2:15
a. m. and the air Is cool and bracing. Every
one on board In In the very best of pood humor,
expecting that we will reach our destination by
2 p. m, to-morrow.
At 3:30 p. m. we passed the three-masted
schooner Fred Sanders running south. She
reported that Â«he had been far to the north,
but, like the others we had met, waa stopped
by the lee; she also reported having met sev
eral steamers trying to work their way to-
A regular watch is now kept in the crow's
nest, and great hopes are entertained that we
will reach tht land of gold by noon to-morrow.
But alas, man proposes, etc., and all hopes of
reaching Nome at an early date ar- now laid
aside. We have a more difficult problem than
getting through the Ice to solve.
On a sand bar In the middle of Bering Sea,
hard and fast. After dodging in and out,
through immense fields of ice for the past
forty-eight hours, until 3 a. m. June 15. we
wake up to- find our engines at a standstill,
not because we have at last reached that prom
ised land of riches, but instead the good ship
Rcsecrans Is hard and fast on a sand bar
("and as helpless as Billy Bryan trying to
solve his 16 to 1 to the satisfaction of the
American people").
Vk'n find we are about eighty miles from
Norr.e and the same distance from St. Michaels.
There is no excitement on board. Every one
Is fully aware of the fact that we are stuck
hard and fast, and here we will stay until such
time as enough labor Is expended In lightering
up the ship to make her float.
At 5 a. m. the 3tearrtr Charles Nelson of San
Francisco IÂ« giving us all the help she can.
She has brok*n two large hawsers and a steel
cable and still we did not budge an Inch. The
pteam barkentlne Morning Star came up close
tc us and asked if we wanted any assistance,
but she cr-uld be of little or no use to us, so
The Charles Nelson,*, finding she could not
move us, left for Dutch Harbor. She has
nearly 400 people en board and has run short
cf provlsicrs.
The work of lightening up the Rosecrans has
now commenced and all hands are at work
taking out cargo. Rafts are being built along
side. Our. big life boats and four surf boats
are being ueed for lighter*,' and the general
merchandise Is being transferred to them as
fast as the winches can lift It out. Another at
tempt was made to move the ship at
high tide to-day, but still not a move. Another
trial was made early on the morning of June
16. and although we moved some distance
astern we are still hard and fast.
At 5:30 p. m. June 17 the tug Meteor came
alongside and was engaged to stand by us
and give any assistance we might need to get
the ship out In deep water.
We have four large rafts of lumber, three
of the ship's life boats and four surf boats all
loaded with freight alongside.' Soundings have
been made to find the deepest channel. One of
our large anchors, with 100 fathoms of steel
cable attached, has been laid out In readiness
to give a haul when the proper time comes,
and the tug Is all ready to give any assistance
that may be required of her.
During the day the wind has been steadily
Increasing and Is now blowing a good stiff
breeze and blowing great fields of ice down
on us. ;Â¦- Â¦-: " â¢:"
At 3:30 a. m. the tug took hold of us. the
steam windlass put on all its power, the ship's
engines went full speed astern, and after a
few moments of anxious waiting the Rose
crans slipped into deep water.
At last we are once more in deep water. But
every raft and boat we had loaded with freight
Is out of sight. While the work of getting
ready to pull the ship off was going on very
little attention was paid to anything elee. and
the wind that kept driving the ice toward us
sent a large pack of ice along, which took hold
of our rafts and boats and carried them away.
The Meteor was at once sent oft to hunt them
up, and she returned about 9:30 with two of
our large rafts and one of the life boats. She
again went out and brought in two more of
the boats, but ail the freight they contained
was gone. The other rafts, four surf boats
and one life boat are still at large and we
have no hope of ever seeing them agaJn.
Reloading the freight and lumber saved Was
then pushed on rapidly and at 8 a. m., June
19, the anchor wan again taken up and we
headed in. toward Nome,, ahy about 100,000 feet
of lumber. 500 packages of general merchan
dise, one life boat and four new surf boats. We
ran up elope to the Ice, and-after finding It
was lmposFlble to get through to Nome we
turned about for Dutch Harbor, and before
reaching open water had to run through sev
enty mllw of very heavy drift Ice.
Thursday, June 21. .we arrived at I>utch Har
bor at 6 p. m. and dropped anchor. All the
Nome and St. Michaels fleet had left for the
north some days ago and . the steamer* Robert
Dollar and Cleveland have been to Nome and
landed all their freight and passenger*. They
went up early In the season and rot In by the
western paisacd going around St. Lawrence

The people who live In Southern Cali
fornia and those whose business it is to
travel between the City of Angels and the
metropolis of the Pacific will find deep
satisfaction In the fact that the Southern
Pacific Company has arrived at a point
where they can see "daylight" In the con
struction of the coast line.
The engineers' department announced
yesterday that the tracks being laid from
Surf southerly and north from Ellwood
are only fifteen inileu apart and that at
COAST GAP SOON TO BE
CLOSKD.
the present rate of construction the con
tinuous rail from San Francisco to Santa
Barbara and I-^>s Angeles should be com
pleted within sixty days. There are sev
eral viaducts to be finished, but the pro
press of the contractors is now satis
factory.
There has been a railroad to Surf for
seven years, but under the new impetus
which competition has given the Southern
Pacific, the difficult and costly work be
yond that point has been continued. From
Surf south thirty-two miles have been
completed and from Ellwood north nine
more miles of track have been added to
the coast system. The work on the road
bed and bridges is of pood quality, calcu
lated for fast and heavy traffic as well as
comfort for the traveler.
The equipment department is prepared
to do its share in opening up the new line
and unless there should be some unfore
seen delay in startinp the trains, due to
managerial policy, the people of Santa
Barbara should be afforded the long-de
ferred opportunity to hold the great rail
road celebration In a few weeks. It has
long been intended that this Jubilee shall
be one of the greatest ever held in the
State.
One of the high officials of the Southern
Pacific Company said yesterday that the
large majority of the public, who believe
that the line will be an "all-cool" route
(lay and night, will be disappointed, as the
Salinas Valley has considerable claims to
being a "hot spot" and that in starting
from this city at 8 o'clock in the morning
the traveler would not reach the coast
till five o'clock In the evening. In his
Btatement, however, he provided some
consolation In the announcement that the
running time would be reduced nearly
one-half, "thus 'reducing the hot-weather
agony in that proportion."
The work of straightening the line from
Ellwood through Santa Barbara to Ven
tura Is under way and will prove a cost
ly one. as it passes through very valuable
Improved property, particularly in the
city of Santa Barbara.
In connection with the construction of
this road, there is no excuse for the empty
dinner pall, by reason of the fact that
the company officials cannot procure labor
fast enough to meet their demands, and
they are still sending orders to Salt Lake
for men to do their work. "We are not
ioingr this to Rive the workingmen of this
State a black eye. but because we are
compelled to have the labor and cannot
set It here," said Chief Engineer Hood
yesterday.
The accompanying diagram shows the
condition of the famous gap that has so
long been the worry of Southern Cal
fornlan3.

CREW OF THE BLACKBRAES BENDING SAIL ON THE BALCLUTHA.
Word has ecrne to the adjutant general
of the National Guard of this State that
the cruiser Philadelphia will be assigned
to duty as a training ship for the Naval
Ite*erve of CaJifornia during the first
Â«voek of Aug-ust next.
There has been a well defined rumor
for scir.e time to the effect that eome ves
tel of the navy wouJd be assigned to the
service of trainir.g the naval reserves on
their annual cruise, but it is only within
the past week that the Philadelphia was
ipoken of as the ship to be assigned. The
notice of bfcr assignment caxne to the ad
i'jtar.t genÂ»?raJ last everBng and he at once
con-.rnunicated with Captain James ; the
commanding officer of the State Naval
Reserve.
It was the expectation of the oracer*
End men of the reserve to be ordered on
i. cruise with the Marion, their own ship,
and preparations for such a cruise have
bettn going along for some time, but the
essig-nment of the Philadelphia seems to
get the possibiiitv of. going out on the
Marion aside. It Is possible, however,
that before the Philadelphia is ready for
th^ duty she will have been sent out to
L'h.'r.a to duty on the Asiatic coast and
the oripinaJ intention cf the reserves may
therefore be carried out.
La?i year the Naval Reserves had a

PREPARING TO

RESERVE TO SEA
There was trouble on the Hawaiian ship
Baiclutba and the British ship Black
braes a couple of days ago. One vessel
loaned some men to the other to bend
sails, and while they were at work they
were stolen by the boarding masters. The
mate of the vessel that lost the men made
the round of the boarding houses and took
his men aboard in spite of ail resistance.
Then the boarding mr-.sters tried to rescue
the sailors and there was a free flght -In
which many a ckuil was cracked and the
runners got the worst of It.
The Blackbraes arrived here on May 24
after a passage that lasted nearly a year.
Not a man aboard has less than $000 com
ing to him and In consequence there were
uo desertions. â¢
The Balclutha. will go to the Sound to
lead lumber fur Australia and was short
of men. Captain Hatiield wanted his sails
bent a*id l-eir.g handed asked for the
loan o' a. few men from the Blackbraes.
As soon zs the men were at work on the
Balclutha the runners appeared on board
with several bottles of water front rye.
As soon as the whiskey got to work the
men were readâ for anything and willing

posed.
When the mate of the Blackbraes heard
that his men had been stolen he at once
went ashore armed with a pistol. He
mÂ«.de the round:, of tne hoarding houses
and Inside of an hour had all of his sail
ers aboard the ship again. The next
morninp the boarding masters made a
combined raid on the Blackbraes. but the
mate and second mate, aided by the
boatswain and carpenter, met them with
belaying pins, and inside of three minutes
the whole invading force was driven over
the side, some of them much the worse
for wear. Yest?rday the Blackbraes went
to Port Costa and there will be more
trouble when she comes down. To-day the
Balclutha will go to sea.

NEWS FROM TIE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
The new Democratic State Central Com
mittee t wiH mret for organization at the
California Hotel In this city on Monday,
July 16. The call for the meeting was 13
sued yesterday by Seth Mann, chairman
of the outgoing State Committee.
The Democrats axe making extensive
preparations for the Bryan and Steven
son ratification meeting at Metropolitan
Temple this evening. Ex-Governor James
H. Budd. Robert Ferral and W. H. Alford
are among the speakers on the list.
The Kansas City nominations were not
received with special demonstrations of
joy Ky San Francisco Democrats. Four
years ago, Just after Bryan was nomi
nated at Chicago, the local lights of the
party went wild with enthusiasm, pre
dicting that the ticKet would sweep tha
country. v es terday there were not many
predictions of Democratic triumph. Re
grets were expressed that Hill of New
i'ork declined second place on the ticket.
Extreme disappointment was caused by
the action of me convention in yielding to
the decree of Bryan in reference to the 16
to 1 plank of the platform. Leading
Democrats threw up tuelr hands ana ac
knowledged that the main chance of
party success had been thrown away in
the declaration for free coinage of silver.
Democrats had hoped to go into the cam
paign as advocates of sound money, but
Bryan's determination to force the silver
question to the front and the convention's
surrender of principle to his whims
dashed their hopes to the ground. No
one could be found yesterday at the head
quarters of the party in the California
.Hotel. ' v
Inquiries develop the fact that tha
Democrats propose to devote special at
tention to candidates for Congress and
the State Legislature. There is Demo
cratic sentiment in favor of nominating
State Senator It. Porter Ashe for Con
gress in the Fourth District. It is said
that Judge Coffey will not accept the nom
ination. Conjecture tha.t Gavin McNab
desires the nomination is not founded
on fact. Last night Mr. McNab said that
he would not accept the position even
if it were offered to him by appointment.
In Republican ranks it is admitted that
Julius Kahn will be renominated. No
doubts of his election, were expressed un
til the report was confirmed that Martin
Keily and Phil Crimmins Congressional
Committee In that district had petitioned
for a separate convention. Members of
the State Central Committee were sur
prised when they heard of the petition
for a separate convention in the Fourth,
as no opposition whatever to Mr. Kahn's
renomination had been reported. So far
as can be ascertained the main purpose
that Crimmins and Kelly have in view
is to perpetuate their hold on the com
mittee of the district. The convention
that nominates the candidate will also ap
point a committee to comprise the gov
erning body of the party in the district
for the next two years.
Republicans should not blind them
selves to the danger of losing a Represen
tative in Congress from the Fourth Dis
trict. If Mr. Kahn's nomination Is de
sired from a convention controlled by
Crimmins and Kelly he will be defeated.
The clean and loyal Republicans of the
various Assembly districts comprising the
Fourth Congressional District should or
ganize at once to defeat at the primary
election every delegate put forward by
the odious and corrupt. bosses of the Mint
Saloon. The bosses expect that the con
test for delegates to the State convention
Ht Santa Cruz will divert the attention of
voters from the duty of selecting respon
sible citizens to compose the Congres
sional district convention. At first glance
the easy-going citizens will say, "What's
the use of scanning the list of delegates to
the district convention, as there is no op
position to Julius Kahn." Therein lies
the dancer. If the district convention be
composed of delegates put up in the Mint
Saloon the brand of Kelly and Crimmins
will be placed on the nominee of the con
vention. The bosses already apprehend
that the people Intend to elect decent men
to serve the party in the State convention
at Santa Cruz. Hence they are afraid
that the clean and decent delegates at
Santa Cruz will name a clean Congres
sional committee to govern the party In
the districts. To prevent the selection
of a reputable governing committee the
petition for a separate convention was
filed.
W. M. Cutter, secretary of the Repub
lican State Central Committee goes to
Santa Cruz to-day to confer with the con
vention committee of that city.
Colonel Georce Stone, chairman of the
Republican State Committee, will soon
leave San Francisco to attend the con
vention at St. Paul of the National
League of Republican Clpbs. He Is presi
dent of the league and will calL the con
vention to order.
The executive committee of the Toune
Men's Republican Leagxze of San FVan
cisco Clubs met last evening in the Mills
building. The committee met for the pur
pose of receiving reports from the com
mittees recently appointed to reorganize
the Assembly district clubs of the league
The committee reported the election of
officers In each of the district clubs, and
also that the membership In some of the
districts was unusually large in compari
son with two years ago.

messenger boy. charged with obtaining
money by false pretenses from the Duns
mulr Coal Company by representing that
he was an agent for different papers, was
commenced before Judge Mogan yester
day. Attorney Joseph Dunne specially
prosf-cuted and Hay was defended by ex-
Judge Ferral. The witnesses examined
were John A. S. Low. manager, and Wal

Strange Woman Arrested.
Mrs. May Palmer of 328 Third street
was arrested yesterday by Officer McMur
ry of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children for cruelty to her two
little ones. It is probable that the wo
man's mental condition will be investi
gated before the charge is pressed. Sev
eral weeks ago. while she was living 'Â¦Â¦ on
Ellis "street. Officer McMurry had occa
sion to visit Mrs. Palmer. She told him
a strange story of being branded with a
figure 8 and some Masonic characters on
various parts of her body when she was
a child in the Alps. An examination
showed that the scars might have been
produced from" something other than a
branding iron. The" woman has been
making ner children, aced 11 and 8 years,
sell chewing gum and papers on the
streets at all hours of. the night.
Hall of Justice Muddle.
That the Hall of Justice muddle Is far
from being settled was shown yesterday
when Acting Auditor Wells refused to
recognize the authority of Shea & Shea,
architects, to certify to the bills of labor
ers, carpenters and plasterers employed
on the building in April and May. De
mands amounting to over $13,000 were
accordingly held up. Wells bases his re
fusal on the charter stipulation that pay
ments on any public buildings shall only
be made when the Auditor Is satisfied
that the certification of demands has been
done by those authorized.
Tracing Moody's Actions.
Mrs. Leon Roylance. who was shot by
her lover. AI Moody, the jockey. Wednes
day morning, continues to hold her own
at the Receiving Hospital. She was re
ported as somewhat improved yesterday,
but it will be some days yet before the
worst or best is known.
Detective Cody, who is working on the
case, reported yesterday that Moody
called on Edward Rolkin, proprietor of
the Winchester House, about 12:10 of the
morning of the Fourth. He wanted to
see Roylance, but Rolkin refused. He
got the number of Roylance's room and
left. He called again about 8 o'clock, but
did tnot see Roylance. He seemed very
much excited. After leaving the Win
chester shortly after midnight he hired
a room at 123 Eddy street, but did not
occupy it. Instead he called upon Mrs.
Upton. Mrs. Roylance's mother, at 423
Body street, and wanted to see her daugh
ter She told him she had gone out with
her aunt, being afraid to tell him she had
gone with her husband, as he had threat
ened to shoot them both.

SHEEPSKINS ATTEST
N THEIR PROFICIENCY
Want Assessments Reduced.
A number of appeals against the As
sessor's estimate of property valuation
was filed by property owners yesterday la
the office of the Board of Supervisors.
Isaac Kahn, 309 California street, swears
that he has been erroneously assessed In
the sum of $100,000, whereas he is worth
only $10,000. Mrs. Rosalie Dusenbury of
the Hotel Pleasanton, assessed for $18,408,
states that she does not own any Sutter
street railway bonds nor San Luis Obispo
railway stocks. Ludwig Altschul, 2417
Sutter street, assessed for $50,000, claims
that he owns but $155 worth of furniture.
G. Podesta, 242 Sutter street, assessed for
$3800 swears that he owns nothing, as his
property was destroyed by fire.
Former Accused of Ungentlemanly
Conduct, Latter of Being Secre
tary of a Fraud.
Ex-Governor James H. Budd was ac
cused of ungentlemanly conduct yesterday
by a witness who In turn was referred to
as the secretary of a fraud. This ended
thf trouble, however, as the court Inter
vened. The action by which the Pacific
Debenture Company seeks to enjoin In
surance Commissioner Clunie from com
pelling it to pay a license, as is re
quired of insurance companies under the
State law, was en trial. Alfred Yordi, sec
retary of the company, was on the stand
and ex-Governor Budd was endeavoring
to elicit information from him regarding
the transfer of bonds from one series to
another or the consolidation of the so
ciu!ed $400 and $500 debenture bonds. Yordi
was evasive in his answers, whereupon
Uudd exclaimed: "He is the secretary of
this fraud, and he has got to testify.'
"If the counsel representing the defend
ant would be more gentlemanly in his
conduct toward me he would get the de
sired Information," said Yordi in answer.
"Read the -witness' statement, Mr. Re
porter," shouted Budd as he stepped
through the railing in the direction of the
witness. "That will do, gentlemen. Con
tinue with the examination," said the
Court, and the disturbers resumed their
stations. An adjournment waa then or
dered until Monday morning.

tition of the North Central Improvement
Association asking that the changes be
made in order to put an end to the con
fusion resulting from the present system,

FEDERAL GRAND JURY
TURNS DOWN HIGGINS
His Charges Against the Manage
ment of the Navy Yard Are
3>eclared Frivolous.
The United States Grand Jury, through
Samuel Polack, foreman, and Robert C.
Mitchell, secretary, made Its final report
yesterday to United States District Judge
de Haven, and was discharged with the
thanks of the court. Since April 23 the
jury has returned true bills in ten cases
and ignored the charge against Frederick
Lagomarslno of opening and destroying a
letter addressed to a person other than
himself. The report adds:
"In addition to the foregoing the Grand
Jury investigated a petition of one John
Higgins. said petition relating to and
complaining of treatment of employes at
Mare Island Navy Yard, and alleging cer
tain actions of various officers ana em
ployes thereat. Five witnesses were ex
amined and after careful consideration
the Grand Jury deemed the charges friv
olous and supported only by hearsay evi
dence and ignored the same."
Higgins is a veteran of the Civil War
and pronounced opponent of the present
administration. His charges were that
men were allowed to spend considerable
time In "loafing" at the Mare Island Navy
Yard; that employes were in the habit of
making presents of cigars and other valu
ables to their superiors and that mater
ial and labor were being wasted.
Board of Police Commissioners Asks
Supervisors to Build One in
Southern District.
The Board of Police Commissioners pe
titioned the Board of Supervisors yester
day asking that $25,000 of the excess rev
enue to be received from the increased as
sessment be set aside for the building of a
new police station on property owned by
the city on the northwest corner of
Fourth and Clara streets. The Southern
Police Station on Folsom street was
burned out some years ago and the head
quarters have since been located in the
basement of the City Hall. The board
says that this branch of the department
has been seriously handicapped because
the station is not located In Its district as
it should be. The Board of Education
having been Interviewed in regard to this
matter will by resolution give consent to
the use of the property for the described
purpose.

of Hawthorne quite aa much as that of
Emerson which tardily convinced Luro
pean readers that America was to develop
a literature of its own.
; Two American writers had undoubtedly,
i In point of purely original creation, pre
ceded Hawthorne â Charles Brockden
j Brown in Philadelphia (1793) and "William
i Austin in Boston (1S24). Under Brown 3
i turgid style and endless complication we
can now recognize a genuine power of
original creation, and though he often
reminds us of the tales of William God
win and of Mrs. Shelley. Godwin's daugh
ter, there is yet evidence that he, on the
whole, influenced them at least as much
as they modified him. William Austin's
two storiesâ "Peter Rugg. the Missing
Man," and "The Man With the Cloaks"â
showed him distinctly as a pioneer in the
path of Hawthorne. His style Is less ex
quisitely finished, but his method of crea
tion is essentially the same, and he re
sembles Hawthorne, even In one of the
latter's finest giftsâ that penumbra of
haziness In which Hawthorne Involves
his purely imaginative creations, leaving
you in doubt at the end whether Arthur
Dimmesdale really had a fiery scar on
his breast or what became of Miriam and
I her lover. _ .
i We notice this the more because Ed
[ ward Bellamy, who In his early writings
gave more promise of reproducing Haw
thorne than any other young American
has given, could never quite master this
I portion of his art. His two early booksâ
' r *Dr. Heidenhoff's Process" and "Miss
I Ludington's Sister"â have much that Is
I Hawthornesque In their conception and
even In their execution, but when the
magician approaches the end his wand
falls from his hand and he has to dis
miss his puppets with the commonplace
explanation that it was all a case of
somnambulism In the one tale and of
plain lying In the other.
If the examples of Brown and Austin In
dicated that there was in the American
mind some tendency toward the ideal, the
style of Hawthorne at least was so abso
lutely his own as to still lack historic ex
planation as to what Influence produced
it. Growing up beside Emerson's, it had
little in common with Emerson: nor was
there any English author of the day to
whom Its delicate precision could be
traced. It seems to nave been born full
grown, for It was essentially the same
when he began to write for the Token,- at
23 as at any later periodâ as simple, as
clear, as pellucid. He wrote at a period
when the Johnsonian traditions still lin
gered; when men used polysyllables:
when writers made a statement in the
first half of a sentence and then said it
over again. In different words. In the last
half; when there were labored parenthe
ses and astounding personifications, as of
"Inoculation! Heavenly Maid!" How did
, It happen that Hawthorne, unaided,
dropped all this literary lumber behind
him? His early tales and sketches were
always short, except in the case of the
"Gentle Boy," which was doubtless too
long drawn. Sometimes too chaste and
cold, perhaps, they yet escaped "the heat
that ofttimes breeds excess." Observe
the entire absence of Italics, though It
was a period when those weeds flourished
In the best trimmed gardens of litera
ture. Even in his "Note Books" we see
not merely the germs of many thoughts,
but often also of this delicate and dis
criminating utterance.
So far as the sound of his physical
voice went, he was the one habitually si
lent author of his circle, and this en
hanced the dignity of his commanding
presence, dark skin, fine eyes and somber
forehead. Emerson said once to George
Curtis, after an evening assemblage in 1
Concord, "Hawthorne rides well his horse
of the night." Though I never exchanged
a word with him. I shall always be grate
ful to have sat in his presence and to have
seen him thus mounted on bis shadowy
steed.
VI.
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
My earliest recollection of Dr. Holmes Is
as a quaint little elderly man. for such he
seemed to me, owing to the difference of
fourteen years at a time when he still de
scribed himself In his poems as "a pallid
boy," and had attained the ripe age of
27. His nephew was my favorite play
mate, an orphan boy of my own age. who
lived with his grandparents In "the gam
brel-roofed house" next door to my
father's. It Is a source of great regret to
all Cantabrigians that this house, intrin
sically more picturesque and quaint than
that of Lowell or Longfellow, should not
have been preserved like theirs. Dr.
Holmes himself often described It, enu
merating Its details and Its contents, and
there Is scarcely an item of these descrip
tions which is not familiar to me In boy
ish memory. Dr.' Holmes himself appears
but little there, but I knew his first vol
ume of poems almost by heart when I was
12 years old and remember vividly when
ment when his temperament did not keep
him substantially j-oung for all practical
purposes. There Is little doubt, however,
of his having begun to feel after the ago
of SO some of that latent depression hard
ly to be escaped by a man who has dis
tinctly outlived his contemporaries. It
is doubtless their narrowing circle which
commonly makes men willing to die at
last.
Charles Sumner used to say of himself
with great truth that he was by nature a
cistern, not a fountain, and Holmes might
have made of himself the opposite state
ment- Though he had read much In var
ious directions and had a quick and avail
able memory, yet the best part of his
talk wa? always that which bubbled up
from within. Few wits have made less
premeditated and deliberate use of their
own witticisms. One of these might in
deed pop into his head and be reissued,
but there wa3 no deliberate housing or
husbanding. I knew in Newport a good
talker of Dr. Holmes' generation who one
day at a dinner table gave off-hand, hav
ing led up to it. a list of the successive
queens of England, with their birthdays.
It seemed to the hosts miraculous until
there was picked up under the chair of the
guest after his , departure a little
condensed manual of knowledge con
taining among other things precise
ly such a list. Nothing could be
more remote from Holmes' temperament
or habit than any such artificial structure.
He was not so good on the whole In re
partee as In soliloquy, but he surnassed
most men in both.
Holmes differed from most of his con
temporaries In this â that his life had dis
tinctly two periods, and the scene of his
final fame was not that in which his first
laurels were won. If he had died In No
vember 1S57. in the forty-ninth year of his
age, he would have been remembered sim
ply as an amusing companion and a good
professor of anatomy. The foundation of
his actual fame was laid at a time when
most people have passed the climax of
theirs. This is not. of course, to be called
an accident: all his previous life had been
unconsciously preparing for this; but it la
startling to think how trivial an accident
might have utterly transformed his po
sition In the history of letters. In this
he was as unlike as possible to his neigh
bors Longfellow and Lowell, who had
marked out their own destinies from early
years. â HIGGINSON.

withstanding the directions printed at
the head of each examination sheet,
! warning applicants not to affix their
j signatures to the papers, a number signed
their names to the letters written as part
of the examination. Applicants that thus
Â¦ disobeyed the rule of the commission will
! not be given a place upon the eligible list,
â¢ but those who would have been eligible
except for their disobedience of the rules
will be permitted to take another exami
nation within six months.
The eligible list was adopted at a spe
cial meeting of the Civil Service Commis
sioners yesterday afternoon. Immediately
after Its adoption tho Election Commis
sioners made requisitions for fourteen
clerks to be employed during the next
four months In the Registrar's office. The

i Kentucky Contestant "Wants a De
cision by the United States
Supreme Court.
It seems as though the Blythe estate
j case would never be settled, although the
I matter in many forms has been before the
! courts for the past seventeen years. Bos
i well 11. Blythe of Kentucky, known as
[ one of the Gypsy Blythes, is about to car
! ry the case to the United States Supreme
! Court. After Probate Judge Coffey passed
Judgment and made an order of distribu
! tlon of the estate of the late Thomas H.
' Blythe to Florence Blytfae-Hinckley (now
! Mrs. Moore), Bos well M. Blythe attempt-
I ed to have the order and judgment set
aside, but without success. He appealed
to the Supreme Court and last January
that tribunal handed down a decision
which sustained the lower court.
Yesterday Attorneys S. \V. and E. B.
Holladay petitioned the Supreme Court
for a writ of error in order to remove the
case to the Supreme Court of the United
States, with the object of upsetting the
final Judgment of the State courts. The
alleged errors and grounds upon which
the case goes to the highest court in the
country are that Florence Blythe was an
alien and under common law an alien can
not inherit property unless specially per
mitted by treaty. The State has no right,
he contends, to make statutes providing
that aliens may inherit a right that
should only be exercised by the Federal
Government and then only in the. form of
a treaty. The Supreme Court of Califor
nia has upheld the State statute, which
is now being attacked by the attorneys
for Boswell M. Blythe. The writ was al
lowed by Chief Justice Beatty.
It is feared that this last litigation may
delay the erection of the Mutual Savings
Bank's projected building on the Blythe
block on the corner of Market and Geary
streets, although the title to the property
was favorably passed upon by a number
of the most reliable title insurance men
before being sold for 1325,000.

//y/\ clares she has the right to sign
11 Ik \> ner naiT!C Clements, is preparing
to make trouble for Coachman
Joseph Clements and the lady who re
cently became his brido. .Mrs. Stycrs-
Clements has carried her troubles to
an attorney and there is likely to be
something interesting happening when
the hack driver, his new love and his old
flame meet.
Mrs. Styers-Clements is living alone In
a little room at 220 Seventh street. She is
weak, pale and wan from the effects of a
long illness, brought on, she says, by
Clements' neglect and broken faith.
"On the ISth of January. 1S94," she
said, "Joseph Clements and myself en
tered into a verbal agreement of mar
riage. He was then and still is in the
employ of the United Carriage Company,
and I was keeping a lodging house. After
we entered into this agreement of mar
riage Clements introduced me to all his
friends as his wife and I conducted my
business under the name of Mrs. Clem
ents.
"Many times," Mrs. Styers-Clements
went on, "Clements asked that I have our
union legally solemnized, but I refused.
He is a man that is in the habit of going
periodically on protracted sprees, and I
thought that by threatening never to
marry him until he gave up drinking
I had a strong hold over him that I might
use to his advantage.
"A year ago last February Clements, at
my suggestion, took a room in town. He
claimed that my lodging house waa too
noisy. He worked nights and conse
quently had to sleep during the day. So
I advised him to take a room where he
would not be disturbed. While he waa
rooming out he used to come up to see
me at my home, 219 Jessie street, and we
used to go out together for our meals.
About three months ago we went up to a
little chophouse at 3S Eighth street and
there my husband met Inez Dott, a wait
ress. After that I saw him no more.
Friends used to come to me and tell me
that they saw Joseph and Inez together,
but I paid no attention to their tales un
til I heard that they had been married.
"He is my husband," concluded Mrs.
Styers-Clements, "and I am going to call
upon the law to protect me and separate
Joseph from that woman."
According to Mrs. Styers-Clements, Inez
Dott was formerly the wife of Thad
Bowles, who is serving a ten years' sen
tence in San Quentin for the murder of
the Dott woman's brother, Clarence de
Spain, at Comptche, Mendocino County.

The many young writers who are now
dazzled at the thought of selling by the
hundred thousand the copies of their un
written novels may well turn back In
memory to the Image of Thoreau carry

copies of the original editionâ 1000â of
his first published book. "I believe," he
says "that this result t3 more Inspiring

than this, as a matter of literary his

by his own statement, "the obscurest lit

Goodrich, says in his reminiscences that
Hawthorne and Willis began to write to
gether in the Token in 1S27, and that Wil
lis "rose rapidly to fame." while Haw
thorne's writings "did not attract the
slightest attention." Even ten years later.
Goodrich testifies, Jn 1S37, It was almost
impossible. to find a publisher for "Twice
Told Talcs." Poe wrote of Hawthorne In
1S46: 1 "It was never the fashion until
lately to speak of him Jn any summary of

THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
HAWTHORNE AND HOLMES: BY COLONEL HIGGINSON.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
Miss Etta M. Brooks, principal witness
for the Government in the case of Fred
erick A. Taylor, charged with stealing
gold from the Mint, gave testimony so
much in favor of the defendant at the pre
liminary examination yesterday that
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock ordered the case dismissed on motion
of Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning."
Taylor was employed as melter in the
Mint and was arrested last Saturday
night as he was going into his house after
leaving the Mint. Secret Service Agent
Hazen found in the prisoner's purse three
small beads of pure gold, and in the room
of Miss Etta M. Brooks, the house servant
at the prisoner's home, a nugget of gold
valued at $80 and three small "buttons" of
the same metal. In a locked trunk be
longing to Taylor, Agent Hazen and
Operator Browne discovered three cru
cibles, some text books on assaying, and
a plush casket containing old jewels and
a slip of paper on which had been written
in pencil in the prisoner's handwriting the
words: "My dear mother's jewels; in
memory of her. P. A. Taylor."
Taylor made a statement to his captors
to the effect that he had made the nugget
out of his mother's jewelry and some
small pieces of virgin gold that he had
obtained when engaged in mining many
years ago, and gave them to Miss Brooks
as a gift in lieu of pocket money, she be
ing at liberty to sell them whenever she
chose. .
Miss Brooks made a statement to Agent
Hazen in the presence and hearing of
Operator Browne and Assistant United
States Attorney Banning to the effect
that ever since she accepted employment
In the Taylor household, Taylor had "per
secuted" her with amatory attentions;
that his wife took all his money every
pay-day; that he gave her the gold In
order that she might convert It into
pocket money with which she and Taylor
might go out and have a good time, he
telling her that if he went to sell it him
self he might be asked questions about it
because of his employment In the Mint.
She accepted the gold, but did not sell it
because she feared that Taylor would
take all the proceeds. This statement was
taken down in writing by Agent Hazen.
In the preliminary examination before
Commissioner Heacock, Taylor was de
fended by D. J. Murphy and Henry E.
Highton, and it was mainly owing to their
skill and stubbornness that Taylor es
caped.
Miss Brooks was the first witness for
the Government. While admitting that
Taylor gave her the gold for pocket
money, she refused to remember the
statement she had made to Hazen,
Browne and Banning, and Mr. Banning
1y reason of the vigorous objections of
.ounsel was prevented from cross-examin
ing her or attempting to impeach the
credibility of her testimony, she being his
own witness.
Agent Hazen was placed on the stand
and asked to state what Miss Brooks had
told him, but the testimony was objected
to as irrelevant, hearsay and incompetent
and the objection was sustained.
Mr. Banning thereupon moved to dis
miss the case and Judge Heacock granted
the motion.
After Agent Hazen had turned over the
gold to Miss Brooks and the crucibles and
Jewelry to Taylor, that gentleman ap
proached Superintendent Leach of the
Mint and extended his hand, with the re
mark:
"Well, Mr. Leach, I hope you are now
satisfied as to my innocence, and I want
to shake hands with you."
"I am not satisfied that you are inno
cent," responded Mr. Leach, "but I have

DISCHARGED BY
JUDGE HEACOCK
Bartley Lee, a laborer, is lying at the
point of death at his home, 1005tÂ£ Na
toma street, and Dr. Connelly, who is at
tending him, says that a clot of blood on
his brain has paralyzed him and will
cause his death.
Lee went to a picnic at Schuetzen Park
Wednesday with John P. pignan, J. C.
Canty and D. Sheerin. When they re
turned to the city they went to a restau
rant on OFarrell street and had a French
dinner. .Lee left the restaurant about 10
o'clock, saying he was going home. From
that time till about 12:20 next morning
nothing is known as to his movements.
At that time he staggered into the bar
room of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Fifth
and Mission fctretts, appearing to be very
drunk. He had evidently fallen, as his
back was covered with dust.
He ai=ked John Forcsman, the bartender,
if he could sit down for a few minutes.
He sat in a chair and fell asieep. About
4 o'clock he fell oft" the chair. He was
deathly sick, and the bartender and some
men who were playing pool carried him
to the sidewalk and bathed his face with
Ice water. Policem: 1 Eskew came along,
and as no one seei;iÂ« <1 to know L,ve, Kskew
rang for the patrol wagon and sent him
to the City Prison to be booked as drunk.
When searched *9 25, a nickel watch, a
badge and a bunch of keys were found
:n his pockets.
About 10 o'clock he was found uncon
scious in his cell and was sent to the
Receiving Hosptal, where Dr. Dorr found
that he was suffering from paralysis of
the brain. He was taken to his home In
the afternoon and Dr. Connelly was sum
moned. The police were notified yester
day morning that he was dying, and an
investigation was started.
What caused the clot of blood on his
brain is so far a. mystery. There was
no mark on his head or face to show
that he had been struck by any instru
ment with the object of robbery. Besides
his money, watch and keys were in his
pockets when taken to the prison. Po
liceman Morrissey, who took him to the
prison in the patrol wagon, says that he
sat upright in the wagon, and ho ap
peared to be all right when booked, ex
cept feeling sick at the stomach. He
drank four bottles of wine ax the French
dinner and possibly that might have
caused the trouble.
Attended a Picnic on the Fourth, Had
a French Dinner, Was Arrested
and Is Now Near to
Death.

DYING FROM A
CLOT OF BLOOD
ON THE BRAIN
6t. Brendan's Catholic Church was
crowded to the doors last evening, the oc
< aslon beir;g the celebration of a triduum
in honor of Our Lady of Perpetual* Help.
Rev. Father Quinn gave the Devotions
and Rev. Father MacCorry. C. S. P..
preached the sermon. The speaker took
hie text from the book of Ocnesis: "Unto
Him let the gathering of the people be."
He said in part:
Iaii us uatber around our Saviour first of a.11
for forgiveness. I place that not last but
lirst. Somehow our part muet be readjusted,
our mistake? condoned, our Fins forgiven, our
transcr.-sskns blotted out. Christ adjusts the
tast b> obliteration. I'nto him. then, let the
Fathering r-i the people be.
Aniin. lÂ»>t us gather around our Saviour as
a Fynjpathlzinfc friend. There are Mmf, I
know, that fay they have no need of such, but
that la only because grief has never taken their
h< arts inio it* two rough hands and crushed
tlieni until they blK-d. We all do need a sympa
j>athy In our wmni.n Â¦ympathy in our be
reavements, sympathy in oar wopc. The Sav
iour has ttâ the Saviour Is It. Unto him let
thÂ« KitheHng of people be. Let us gather
around our Saviour, finally, because he Is alto-
KrthCT lovelyâ beautiful beyond tie Â»onÂ» of
men.
Father MacCorry then drew a picture of
the surpassing loveliness of the Saviour's
countenance and personality and urgred
that durinp those blessed days of his
mother's triduum worshiper* shouid bpg
that she intercede, that. In the <~n<l. they
might enjoy "the vision of his face."

Working in a Good Cause.
"In the Institution where I am em-
ployed as nurse (The Home for Aged
Women) we find many ladies suffering
from gastric trouble caused by coffee.
"My own personal experience is that
since a child I have been a moderate
drinker of coffee, but most of the latter
years have suffered from acidity of the
Stomach, sluggish liver and nervousness.
"I finally gave up coffee entirely,
about tluee years ago, using hot water
in its place. Of course, after removing
the cause, the symptoms disappeared,
but I seemed to need a beverage more
ftrengthening than hot water, as my oc-
cupation of nurse required considerable
exertion. I began to look about for a
suitable breakfast beverage and under-
took the preparation of one by brown-
ing some wheat berries and using that
;is coffee, but the result was far from
satisfactory. Finally I came across Pos-
tum Food Coffee, on a visit at my home
in Rofcl'.e, N. J.. and found it exactly
fitted the case.
"I have been using it regularly and in-
troduced it to our institution. When it
was first served it was not satisfactory,
but I looked into the matter and in-
M*ted upon having it boiled fully fifteen
minutes after the actual boiling had
started, not counting the time that it
â¢ was on the stove before boiling began.
The next time it appeared you would
not think it was the same article; it was
fo much improved. Several of the pa-
tients decided to use it to the exclusion
of coffee, and I found that its use re-
duced the number of cases of indiges-
tion. The result has been very gratify-
ing, and for two years now Po'stum
Food Coffee has bceti in daily use at the
Home.

NEW YORK. July 6.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Failures ln the first half of 1900 were 5362
with liabilities of $100,570,134. There were thirty
failures of banks and financial corporations of
J25.S-2.SG2, leaving 5332 commercial failures with
liabilities of $74,747,457.
Had it been predicted that the vast iron In
dustry would be thrown from unprecedented
activity into great- depression, with many
works closed and prices reduced fully a quarter,
with practically no failures,' it would have
been thought Impossible. Yet the six fail
ures ln that department - for the last quarter
were in all for only $28,935. though Bessemer
pig has fallen from J25 to J18. and plates from
S.lc to 1.5c. and the average for iron and steel
products has declined about 25 per cent since
January 10. Some further decline Is now ex
pected before things are adjusted for another
active season and efforts to arrange wages are
progressing.
The Fall River committee has decided to close
their cotton mills for a time and some of the
largest woolen works have been closed or much

NEW YORK, July Â«.â Bra<5Â»treefs will say
to-morrow: Business is unusually dull at this
season, and this year no exception to the gen
eral rule is remarked. A review of the past
six months, however, gives little comfort to
pessimists. Bank clearings. It is true are
smaller by about 11 per cent than they were in
the, first half of 1S9D, but railway earnings are
about 10 per cent larger, and business failures
as reported to Bradstreet's are the fewest re
ported for eighteen years back, with liabili
ties of failing trades the same, with one ex
ception, and that last year, since 1S?2. Winter
wheat has about all been harvested in the
Southwest and the yield there has been very
large. Copious rains in the Northwest, too,
have apparently w/irked some Improvement,'
judging from the more cheerful tone of advices
received thence this week. Wool Is dull and
manufacturers are supplying only actual wants.
Prices arÂ« at the lowest point reached this sea
son, ln sympathy with the lower opening of
the July wool sale â¢ at London, where finer
grades are relatively weakest.
In manufacturing lines dullness and weak
ness are most marked In products of iron and
dteel. Talk of an effort by the great combina
tions to control prices in the Ip.tter industry is
heard, but in the almost tbtal lack of new busi
ness the basic material, pig Iron, weakens
steadily, with some authorities predicting a 23
I>er cent reduction from present prices, which
are not attracting buyers. X
The settlement of labor troubles Is reflected
ln the better demand for building materials at
affected centers, while rains In the Northwest
have allowed white pine manufacturers to open
their works and give employment to many
thousands of men. Southern pine prices are
weak and the market for that material is very
dull.
Anthracite coal has advanced 23 cents a ton,
and, while demand has not increased heavily,
the feeling in that trade is rather more cheer
ful. Sugar has been marked up again this
week, coffee Is higher, while tea holds the full
advance scored on the outbreak of the Chinese
troubles.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.01S.832 bushels, against 3.I.M.
144 bushels last week; 3,738,972 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899; 2,723,642 bushels in
189$; 2,502,606 bushels In 1897, and 2,167,076 bush
els ln 1816.
Business failures In the United States for
the week number 196, as compared with 185 last
week, 136 ln this week a year ago, 241 ln 1898,
213 in 1S97 and 219 In 1896.
Business failures ln Canada number 25, as
compared with IS last week, 25 in this week a
year ago, 16 in 18J8, 34 ln 1897 and 32 in 1S96.

CHICAGO, July 6. â The wheat market opened
with a degree of steadiness, beacause Liverpool
at the outset failed to show as much decline
as had been expected. August, to set the ball
rolling, sold at 79'/i378%c at the opening and
shortly afterward attained 79V4'g73*4c. The
bears took a hand in the game. Argentine ship
ments were heavy. Liverpool turned weak,
Minneapolis was bearish and there were more
rains in the Northwest. August, on selling by
persons who noted these facts, slumped off
during the forenoon to 76Uc. New York report
ed a better export inquiry and Jlfty loads taken
for foreign shipment. Attention to the gravity
of the situation In China was directed by a
report that Germany was chartering transports
to take troops to China. In these Items shorts
found reasons to cover. One man was reported
to have taken ln one million bushels.
Corn was active most of the time and strong.
The hot dry weather ln Kansas was a consid
eration on the other hand. Damage was re
ported from this State and from parts of Ne
braska. Bulls allowed the market to drag and
then got to work. Shorts covered and the mar
ket responded with a rush. August closed %c
better.
Oats were quiet and toddled along after the
big market. The market dipped early with
wheat and rallied later with com. August
closed %c over yesterday.
Provisions opened strong on light hog re
ceipts and an advance at Liverpool, but the
market slumped off on the selling of a local line
of ribs. September pork closed 12V4@15c under
yesterday.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Cash quotations were as follows: Flour,

NEW TORK. July 6.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
Although activity has been of the restricted
kind, suitable to the summer season, and
though speculation still has almost entirely a
professional origin, the past week has witnessed
both a strong and an interesting market, lu
fact. Its strength in the face of dullness and of
adverse^ political developments at home and
abroad has been somewhat remarkable.
The Chinese situation, involving danger to the
European markets, with the possibility of fu
ture international complications, brought a free
selling of stocks here for account of Berlin,
and to tome extent for London. These offer
ings were, however, readily absorbed and Watl
street wan apparently indisposed to borrow
trouble by looking too far ahead in connection
with China. The adoption by the Kansas City
convention of a free silver plank, without mod
ification of the 18 to 1 principle, was also ap
parently disregarded, or it might be said that
the market was inclined to a belief thnt this
action renders the outlook ln the national cam
paign that is now beginning more certain -tlvin
if the Chicago platform of four years ago had
been modified in Its tinanical sections. Conserv
ative people, of course, give due weight to the
uncertainties that are liable to develop in con
nection with domestic politics, and there is in
euch quarters a due recognition of the dangers
that are Involved ln China. This seems to have
brought back many large flnanlcal Interest!*,
but on the ether hand money is easy and the
enormous disbursements of income on July 1,
have brought a large supply of funds into the
stock market for reinvestment.
Although scattered, the buying of dividend
paying stocks has been large and persistent.
and commission houses report a considerable
demand of that kind, which, of course, re
duces the floating supply. The fact that rains
have improved the wheat situation in the
Northwest and have caused expectations of
half a crop to replace the estimate of a total
faliure of the spring wheat yield in three im
portant States also helped the market and
caused coverings of shorts throughout the list.
The belief that a change for the better Is at
hand in the iron trade also had a good effect
on the Industrials. In the railroads the an
thracite group was the active feature of the
week, with sharp advances in several of the
members, giving rise to the idea that some im
portant deal involving trunk line interests Is ln
prospect.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
known for some days to come, they differ very
little from 400.000.000 bushels wheat and corn
together, which was almost exactly the quan
tity exported last year, while ln 1898 It was
slightly larger. It Is now asked by the most
conservative whether Indian corn -has -not at
last crept into such favorÂ» in place of other
grain that a larger quantity of It will be re
quired hereafter, lessening the strain ln this
country when wheat Is in short supply and
without curtailing the supply to the world's
needs or the sum due to this country on bal
ances. A single -moderately short wheat crop
might change all calculations ln this respect
for the future.

form as fatal to Bryan's chances and beginning
to discount the re-election of President Mc-
Kinley. I

The canners are after Bartlett Pears and art
willingly paying $20 per ton. Some are buying
them second hand from Eastern shippers as
hlfe-h as (25. The fact is. the usual glut in
fruit did not come to hand this year, much to
the surprise of the whole trade, and nobobdy
seems to understand why. Some think that th#
crop of all fruits Is much less than expected
two months ago; others that the Eastern and
Northern demand has been so great that all
the .surplus has been taken to satisfy It. What
ever the cause, however, we are certainly hav
ing one of the best fruit seasons for six or
seven years, and it bids fair to continue so.
There is no accumulation of stock, and both
canners and Eastern shippers are obliged to

iLADY'S MAIDS IN EUROPE.
A Necessity There, Though Held to
"Be a Luxury Here.
"For one thing European women are to
be envied," said a young student of sing
ing who has Just returned from a sojourn
of three year3 In Europe. "That la the
facility with which they are able to keep
lady's maids on little or no income. 1 have
known women abroad to keep maids when
I wondered how they could employ them
working on the meager wardrobes they
seemed to possess.
"A lady's maid is looked upon by moat
American women as a luxury. An Ameri
can woman never thinks of engaging a
maid until she has pretty nearly every
thing else in the world that a reasonable
woman would want. After she has ac
quired Jewelry, clothes and an Income
which is likely to enable her to enjoy
these things permanently, she thinks of
getting a maid to take care of them. But
the maid abroad Is a necessity, to judge
from her unexpected appearance In the
service of many women." I have met
frowzy old women of title In Germany,
dressed in shabby black and living in

he has not yet been able to get a clew
to the man and woman supposed to have
started the lire. A gallon demijohn filled
with coal oil and wrapped in brown paper
was found at the house. It was care
fully tied, apparently the work of some
grocer. The Fire Marshal thinks the coal
oil was purchased at another part of the
city*and if he could ascertain the grocer
from whom it was purchased he thinks he
could get a clew worth following.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
< 111S Broadway, July 6.
A number of children of the vacation
school, about twenty-seven boys and girls
all told, went to Trestle Glen on a botan
ical excursion this morning. The chil
dren gathered at the schoolhouse at 9
o'clock and from there went on a car to
Trestle Glen. The ladles of the Oakland
Club had provided a basket lunch and
everything was done to make the little
students of nature enjoy, as well as profit
by. their outing.
For several days preceding Mrs. Cun
ningham had been instructing the children
In botany and other nature studies, and
she accompanied the children this morn-
Ing The young students were delighted
with their object-lessons and came home
laden with varieties of leaves and flow
er" The boys, turning more to zoology,
made collections of polllwogs, beetles and
frogs.
The' teachers who had charge of the
excursion were Hiss McClees, superin
tendent of the vacation school: Miss Alice
McChesney, Miss Carlton and Mr. "Wel
kins, superintendent of the play ground.
The vacation school will probably close
next Friday, unless the Oakland Club
should decide at Its next, meeting to con
tinue the school for another -week. The
exercises on that occasion will be very In
teresting and the work done by the chil
dren during the term will be on exhibition.
On the day before the Fourth a patriotic
programme was rendered by the pupils of
the vacation school. Giles \V. Gray of the
Board of Education was present and made
a speech, which was very much appre
ciated by his youthful auditors. Mrs. G.
W. Bunnell, president of the Oakland
Club, was also present and entertained
the children with a little story effectively
told.

OBJECT LESSONS
FROM DELLS OF
TRESTLE GLEN
small hotels of the kind I visited, who
might have gone for years without a ne-wr
bonnet, to judge by their appearance. But
they all had their maids. I found the
same thing true In France. Thin, sharp
faced, unmarried women, who had long
passed the age when they needed the pro
tection of a maid and who might be en
tirely without vanity or thought for their
personal appearance, to judge by * their
looks, had their maids. English women
who would . ask for the smallest and
cheapest room In the hotel and would
haggle with the proprietor over rates un
til he was almost ready to let them go
rather than take off n cent more, might
arrive with a very small allowance cf
luggage, but their maids were in charge
"No American woman who had to live
so economically as these women would
ever think of dragging a maid after her.
But It always seemed as if the maid were
a distinctly necessary part of the exist
ence of the women to whom I refer. Most
of them looked as If they had a hard time
In struKpIlng alons? themselves, but they
were determined to get the comfort that
came from having a maid to look after
them. Most women appreciate the luxury
that Is supplied by the services of a maid,
even if they would net consider that It
afforded sufficient compensation for the
economy necessary in other directions.
The foreigner has her maid, however,
even if she has to be parsimonious In
other matters."
One reason for the custom of employing
lady's maids In Europe, even when tha
mistress Is not rich, could probably ba
found In the greater cheapness of living
for servants abroad. In New York hotels
the mistress must pay nearly as much for
her maid's entertainment as for her own.
and, combined with the maid'3 wages, the
cost for keeping her can be borne only by
the wealthy, or at least by those who can,
indulge themselves in any luxury they de
sire. Lady's maid3 are so rare In th*
United States that no arrangements for
housing 1 them reasonably have ever been
made. The lady's maid Is probably em
ployed as frequently here as in Europe In
the families of well-to-do people. Prob
ably every New York family of a certain
Income employs one or more lady's maids,
in accordance with th<? number of daugh
ters there may be in the household. Under
such circumstances a lady's maid is Ies3
expensive than she is in a hotel. Mald3
who are not accomplished seamstresses
will find it difficult to get employment.
They are relied upon to do much of the
plain sewing: of the youns girls and usu
ally make their gowns when these are not
too elaborate. So they are not an extrav
agance. It is only to the woman who
boards that the lady's maid is a luxury la
this country.

men of the profession are arrayed
against each other. I, of course, had no
conception of the nature of the case un
til I went to Oakland to hear the de
murrer. Up to that time I did not know,
nor had I ever seen, that I knew of, any
of the parties connected with the liti
gation on either side; and at this time,
the only parties connected with the
cause whom I know to call by name are
the attorneys. Even If I had known,
and did know, all the parties Interested
In this migration. I know myself well
enough to say that I could try the case
with absolute fairness according to the
evidence and the law as I understand H.
If I had the slightest suspicion that I
would permit anything which has thus
far occurred In this case to interfere
with that fair and impartial trial to
which all people are entitled under the
law, I should consider it my bounden
duty to not go farther with the case.
I realize the importance of the ques
tions involved, not only to the people of
Oakland but also to the plaintiff, and
the issues should and shall be deter
mined upon the merits of the case, let
the consequences be what they may.
Deeply deprecating any unpleasant
ness which may have come to you by â¢
reason of this unfortunate proceeding,
and with best wishes, I beg to subscribe
myself, yours truly,

The following letter was sent by Judge
Hurt to Judge Ogden to-day and given
out for publication:
BORRY HE WAS CALLED.
SACRAMENTO CITT,' July 4, 1900.
Hon. F. B. Ogden. Superior Judge.
Oakland, Cal. â l>ear Judge: Rome time
nfto. Immediately upon learning of the
petition to the Supreme Court for a
' writ of prohibition upon the part of
the defendants In the case of the Contra
Costa Water i Company vs. the City of
Oakland et al., to prevent me from fur
ther participating in the trial of said
case, 'I addressed to you a letter, which
was written under the Influence of the Â¦
earnest importunities of my family, say
ing that I would. In all probability, retire
from the trial of said cause, even If the
Supreme Court sustained me. A day or
two later, upon consultation with a
number of my friends h<Â»re. I sent you a
t^lesrarr. recalling that letter nnd saying
that I would not rttire from the trial of
the case.
In tha outset, permit me to say that.
If I felt Justified in following my per-
Eonal wishes in the matter, I would have Â¦
no hesitation, under the circumstances,
in refusing to go on with the trial of
the case; but last night I carefully read
the decision of the Supreme Court and
after further consultation with the most
reputable lawyers f this bar, as well
ns other prominent citizens whose JudK
ment I respect, I was forced to the con
clusion that I could not Fee my way
cl^Rr. honorably, to pursue any other
course than to remain as the trial
Judge In said cause. The Supreme Court
has said that I could not retire now ;
without embarrassment, except upon
consent of cour-sel on both sides. This
is concurred in by all my friends, be- Â¦
cause by the lanpruape thus em- â¢
ployed by the Supreme Court It â¢
is undoubtedly meant that, as â¢
a Judicial ofneer, I owe a duty .
to the Judicial arm of the Government ;
and should fearlessly discharge it. This i
I am determined to do. Personally, I
wish from the bottom of my heart that I
had never been called Into the case, and
Â¦understand me that. In saying: this, I .
am suggesting or Insinuating no com- Â¦
plaint aealnÂ«t you for having called me â¢
In; but to permit myself to be driven
from Its trial now. under circumstances â¢
such as characterized the proceedings In- â¢
volved in the objections against me, .
would be cowardly, and a severe rertec- .

Tho affidavit of William D. English sets
forth that he was present at a meeting
of the City Council on March 15, at which
Councilman George R. Stetson stated that
he had not investigated the question of
water rates and knew nothing of such
matters. The Councilman Is said to have
declared that if -any wrong should be done
by the passage of the ordinance author
izing the reduction of 25 per cent, thd Fire
and Water Committee should be held re
sponsible, as he had not thoroughly ln
vcstlgcted the matter himself.
In defending the claim of the corpora
tion that the plant acquired from the
Oakland Water Compapy is essential to
a proper water supply for the city of Oak
land, Watkinson says that the wells at
Alavarado are now supplying 4,000,000 gal
lons of water daily. In addition to the
'artesian water, the company supplies
from its other sources 7,000.000 gallons
dally. AH of this water is necessary, ac
cording to the president, anel without the
Alvarado wells the corporation could not
properly supply its customers. W'atkin
son estimates that during the year the
artesian wells will be called upon for a
daily supply of 3,500,000 gallons.
The affiant further states that the Con
tra Costa Water Company now supplies
1200 consumers, whose average monthly
bills are $1 60 each. He alleges that If the
city should force the collection of the
bills at the rates fixed by the Council,
and It should later be held that the ordi
nance is invalid. It would be Impossible*
for the corporation to collect any sum in
excess of the amounts first secured.
New Wells Essential.
The affiant concludes by quoting from
an alleged statement made by Councilman
Louis Schaffer. which Is as follows:
"I wanted to see something from a
civil engineer before I voted. It may be
that the rates proposed to be established
in the ordinance of March 5, 1900, are all
right, but I saw nothing presented to the
City Council that' justified me in accept
ing them."
In behalf of the Contra Costa Water
Company, President Watkinson alleges
that the water rates fixed by the City
Council are more than 25 per cent lower
than the rates of July 1, 1899. Instead of
25 per cent he says there Is a reduction
of 35 per cent.
Wanted Expert Testimony.
"The only intelligent way for a City
Council to fix the water rates is for it
to employ competent engineers and have
a full Investigation of the water com
pany's plant made."
Councilman H. D. Rowe is said to have
expressed his ideas of the water-rate
question as follows:
"I consider that what was the property
of the Oakland Water Company or the
Dingee plant was properly excluded from
the City Council's estimate In fixing wa-
Councilman J. G. Lemmon, according to
President Watkinson, made the following
statement in regard to the establishment
of the water rates:
The following is alleged to be an extract
from a signed statement made Alarch 15
by Councilman Frank F. Mott:
"This question of fixing water rates is
a complicated matter. We really ought
tc have meter rates. We could then tell
the number of feet used and the charge
could be made accordingly. Citizens of
all portions of the city told me that the
water rate was too high and the cut of
25 per cent in the rate was made because
so great a sentiment demanded respect.
This reduction will give the people a very
low rate."
Councilman Anson Barstow is said to
have declared on March 16, a week before
the rates, were fixed, that the Council was
groping in the dark with regard to the
fixing of water rates, and that it was
impossible for that body to determine the
valuation of the water company's plant
during an investigation of a month's dura-
Groping in the Dark.
thrown out we saw our way clear to cut
the rates 25 yer cent.. Of course to fix
the water rates as they should be fixed
we should have heard from expert ac
countants and competent engineers."

DEATH OF MRS. WENTWORTH
AFTER A LONG ILLNESS
â¢.'In fixing the water rates the Council
threw out and did not consider the plant
of the former Oakland Water Company
We simply Ignored the plant, and this en
abled us to make the 23 per cent cut. The
only way to get at the real facts Is to
have one or more competent engineers
to place an intelligent value on the plant
and then fix the rates on a basis given
by these figures."

The following is said to be a portion of
a signed statement by Councilman Edwin
Meose- .
Charged to Meese.
"With a municipal , r water supply the
rates would not be much lower than un
der the ordinance passed to print by the
City Council March 5, 1900, wherein we
made * horizontal cut of 25 per cent."
Councilman GIrard is quoted as follows
"This horizontal reduction will nut
about JS0.000 into the pockets of the peo
ple and take it out of the pockets of the
rich Contra CoBta v stockholders. The peo
ple of Oakland ought, to appreciate this
big cut. The Council showed itself to be
for the people and not for the Contra
Costa monopolists. In arriving at the
rresent water rates we left the plant of
the Dingee company, or the Oakland Wa
ter Company, entirely out of considera
tion." Â¦
Stetson's Alleged Statement.
To prove that the plant and rights ac
quired from the Oakland Water Company,
better known as tha Dingee company, are
necessary for the supply of sufficient
water to the Contra Costa Company's
subscribers in this city, President Watkin
son presents a sworn statement snowing
that the wells at Alvarado, a portion of
the Oakland company's plant, are now
furnishing a large proportion of the water
consumed in Oakland. It is further set
forth by the head of the corporation that
a still greater dependence jyill be placed
upon the Alvarado wells during the com
ing year. President Watklnson then
auotes alleeed statements from all of the
City Councllmen which, ho claims, show
that undue haste was used in fixing the
rates. First he asserts that Councilman
George R. Stetson made the following
statement:
New Plant Necessary.
To substantiate its claims with relation
to the allegeel Illegal course pursued by
the City Council in establishing water
rates for the year, affidavits are presented
by J. H. T. AVatkinson, president of the
Contra Costa Water Company, and Wil
liam D. English, who is set forth as a tax
an<l water rate payer of the city of Oak
land. Both affidavits allege immature
action and illegal figuring by the members
of the Council, Each member of the City
Council is quoted at length in an effort
to show that snap judgment was taken on
the Question of water rates and that tho
city's legislators were unduly influenced
by the popular cry of exorbitant rates,
without a proper consideration of the cost
of the wa^or company's plant and tho le
gal interest allowed on the investment.
As further grounds for the motion the
water company's legal representatives re
cite that if the water rate ordinance Is
enforced It will work irreparable damage
to the corporation.
This injunction is asked upon the ground
that the ordinance is void, by reason of
the acts of the Council, thus enforcing a
ruling upon this point, which Is one of the
main points of their original action.
This motion for an injunction prevent
ing the city from putting the low rate or
dinance in force is at once an effort to
secure legal permission to collect water
rates of some kind without the penalty
provided by the constitution of forfeiture
of its franchise and plant/ and an effort
to try the legality of the low-water ' rate
ordinance upon the injunction proceed
ings. It is literally a trial of the case by
injunction.
The specific motion made by the Contra
Costa Water Company in the documents
filed to-day Is for an injunction to pre
vent the city of Oakland from compelling
the collection of bills for water at the
rates fixed by the ordinance adopted by
the City Council on March 24 last, and to
prevent the enforcement of this ordinance,
which went into effect on July 1.
A Corporation Trick.
At that time this paper showed how the
Contra Costa Water Company, under the
suit instituted by itself, would be unable
to collect any water rates at all, anel that
until a final decision was reached by the
Supreme Court all of the vast income of
the company would be tied up. It is ob
vious that no water company could afford
to have its income tied up for twelve
months, even though it knew that au the
end of that time it would receive every
cent that was elue. It wouK'Stake a vast
fortune to carry on a water company
for a year without any income whatever.
The company now finds itself in the posi
tion of being compelled to collect under
the new and low-rate ordinance, thus rec
ognizing that ordinance in law and in
fact, or not being able to collect any at
all under penalty of forfeiture of its fran
chise.
This motion of the Contra Costa Water
Company for an Injunction against the
city of Oakland is an effort to get Itself
out of the corner in whiSii It has been
forced over the collection of water rates
pending the settlement of this action.
This position was fully described in The
Call a few days ago.
Judge Hart also announces that he will
stick to the xUameda County bench and
will try this case in spite of fire, water
and the city of Oakland. He was writ
ten a letter to Superior Judge F. B. Ogden
to this effect, saying that he will be com
pelled to defend the honor of the bench
and remain to try the case. At the same
time he announces that he will hear the
motion of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany for a trial of this case by injunction
upon one day's notice.
It is fair to Judge Hart to say that he
does not specifically announce that he will
hear this particular motion on one day's
notice; but he says that he will consider
one day's notice sufficient upon which a
hearing for an injunction can be had. Al
most at the same moment, with a re
markable coincidence of time, the Contra
Costa Water Company files a motion for
an injunction.
Hart Determined to Stick.
But one conclusion can be drawn from
the notice sent by Judge Hart and the
motion for the injunction that is made by
the Contra Costa Water Company. It
means that the city of Oakland will have
to answer this very important motion
upon one day's notice, and that the city's
attorneys will be asked to prepare an an
swer upon a point that the attorneys for
the corporation have been studying for
months, with less than twenty-four hours'
notice. Every advantage was taken in
the filing of the papers. They were pre
sented to the County Clerk almost at the
last moment to-day, and Judge Hart gave
notice that he would be ready to near the
motion to-morrow morning."
City Attorney W. A. Dow Is out of
town on his vacation ar.d Robert Y.
Hayne. the special attorney of the city
of Oakland, will have to go over the
ground that has been studied by the cor
poration's attorneys for months in their
long preparation of their case, in the
brief period of one night.
GOOD cause being shown
therefor, it is hereby
ordered that plaintiff's time
for giving notice of motion
for an injunction in the above
entitled matter be and the
same is hereby shortened to
one day.
E. C. HART, Judjje.
Dated July 5, 1900.
OAKLAND, July 6.â The above re
markable notice from Judge E. C.
Hart, together with five extremely
long affidavits, were filed in the of
fice of the County Clerk of Alameda
County a few moments before that office
closed for business to-night. The afn
davits requested Judge Hart to grant the
Contra Costa Water Company an injunc
tion against the citj^ of Oakland and all
water-rate payers therein, restraining
them from paying water rates under the
water-rate ordinance that was adopted by
the City Council last March.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. July 6.
It was practically decided to-day that
the old great register would be used at
the corning Congressional primary elec
tion, if not at the county primary, which
â¢will come later. Registration has pro
ceeded so slowly that only a small per
centage of the voters of ;hc county are
on the new register, and to hÂ»ld an elec
tion with the new register only would
enfranchise probably half of the voters
cf Alameda County.
The Board of Supervisors held a meet
ing to-day to <ii?cut-s registration and pre
cinct boundaries, and it was during this
discussion that the registration matter
came up in such forcible manner. J. P.
Cook. Chief Deputy County Clerk, ap
peared before the board to ask for more
help in getting out the register, and he
was questioned very closely by the Super
\isors.
"The old rogiFt*r of two years ago will
have to be> used at the coming primaries,"
i-aid Mr. Cook, '"with the new registra
tions as a supplement."
Then he add"d. in response to questions
by Supervisor Roeth: "Probably forty per
cent of the narm-s on the old register are
now illegal through removals."
The matter of additional help for the
preat register was referred to the District
Attorney, and h*> was requested to report
to the board on Monday.
The consolidation eÂ»f boundaries of pre- ;
cincts for the approaching primaries also
occupied considerable time. In order to
pave money in election polling places and
i election officers; the full limit of consoli
dation will Le adopted, and three regular
election precincts will be rolled into one Â¦
primary precinct. As the lines of the]
various Supervisorial. Assembly and j
Senatorial districts crofs each other at
unusur.I points ane! angles, this consolida
tion will be a complicated matter.
The board decided to settle everything
at its regular meeting on Monday. j

A Populist Statesman.
"Why do you call him a good Populist
statesman?"
"Because his Congressional record shows
that he has Introduced more resolutions
of Inquiry than any two other men."â

The Building Review finds that with
one exception the record for the month
of June of this year exceeds that of any
June in San Francisco since records have
been kept, and it predicts that 1900 will
be one of the banner years in building
activities. The total for six months in
1900 is $3,129,598, the improvements num
bering 538. The total for June is $912,151,
the improvements numbering 124. In 1SS4,
1SS5, 1SS6, 1SS7, 18S9, 1890, 1S91, 1S92, 1S95 and
1896 the improvements reached a higher
total for their first periods of six months
than in 1900. The highest building total
for the rlrst six months in any year in
this city was in 1830, when the improve
ments numbered 781 and the total cost in
volved was $5,576,070.

loans on city real estate for the first
six months of the present year have
amounted to $9,562,920 and the releases m
the same period make a total of $s,30o,oos.
The comparison with the corresponding
period in two years preceding shows that
Fn the first six months of 189S the loans
amounted to 57.470,046 and the releases Â£0
$5,326,848; in the first Elx months of 1899 the
loans amounted to $0,200,004 and the re
leases to $6,937,590. There have been 20il
loans and 1781 releases in the six months
of this y "ar as compared to 1970 loans and
1391 rellases in tho 'first half of 1S98 and
1981 loans and 1609 releases in the first half
of 1S9Â« Thomas Magce comments on the
ngu-es for the first half of the present
vear in the matter of loans and releases,
and calls attention, in his Real Estate
Circular, to .the fact that the savings
banks of the city, notwithstanding that
they have invested probably as much as
$3,500,000 in bonds and stocks during the
past half year, have about So.OOO.OOO on
hand and unasked for. The reason that
there has been such a small demand for
money is, so says Mr. Magee, because
buyers of real estate have been mostly
buyers with money in their hands for per*
sonal Investment or manufacturers â who
have purchased for actual use, their ob
ject being to become owners at the pres
ent reasonable prices for factory and
warehouse properties. The following table
is furnished by Mr. Magee. showing the
mortgages and releases for 1900 up to
July 1:
TRANSACTIONS IN REALTY
The Real Estate Record, published by G.
H. Umbsen & Co., says: "The most
marked feature of the year just elapsed
has been the heavy investments made
south of Market street and particularly in
the water front district of the city. Al
though many of the deeds have gone on
record to individuals, it is no longer a
secret that the real buyers are corpora
tions with which Collis P. Huntington ia
connected. It is also a fact that all of
the land sought for has not been acquired
and that more transactions Â¦will soon be
made public." At the time the news ot
these transactions was published in The
Call there was a general inclination, in
some quarters, to dispute the accuracy
of the statements made.
Renting business is better than during
any previous June in six or seven years.
The ability to rent houses helps mater
ially to fix the value of residence prop
erties. >-

A Course of Preparatory Instruction
for Pupils Deficient in Certain
Courses.
The preparatory classes and the third
academic class of St. Ignatius College
opened for the new term yesterday morn
ing, and quite a large number of pupils
were enrolled.
The advantages of the classes opened
yesterday are many, chief of which is the
preparation of pupils In the particular
branches in which they may prove defi
cient, and which otherwise might act as
a drawback to them during the scholastic
year. . .
The regular term of the college will be
inaugurated on the 6th of August.

property until a Judgment entered against
her in favor of the defunct People's Home
Savings Bank for 559.000- was satisfied, has

ard has paid $55,000 on the judgment and
as soon as she can realize on the personal
property that was tted up under the in
junction she will satisfy the balance. Al
though it is said Mrs. Rickard will satisfy

to appeal if so advised.
Xre Blanche Is Penitent.
Mrs. Catherine Le Blanche, who was
shot by her husband in the Webb House,
Second street, early Sunday morning-, was
taken from the Receiving Hospital to St.
Luke's Hospital yesterday afternoon. Her
husband will defray all her expenses, and
before she was taken away she frankly
said that so far as her husband was con
cerned she would not prosecute him. That
means that P. J. Curtln. the private de
tective, against whom she was so bitter
for holding her while her husband shot
her, will also escape prosecution. Attor
ney O'Brien, who represents Mrs. LÂ©
Blanche, had promised to have her re
moved to St. Mary's Hospital Wednesday,
but there was a hitch somewhere. Thurs
day night Mrs. Roylance, who was placed
on: a cot near her. moaned so badly that
Mrs. Le Blanche could not get any sleep
and was fretful and impatient to get out
of the hospital. Her wish was gratified
yesterday afternoon.

MANAGER AND PORTER
MIX AT HOTEL RAFAEL
Baggageman's Grievance That He
Was Discharged Because of a
Recent Burglary.
There was an exciting setto at Hotel
Rafael yesterday morning between Man
ager F. V. Halton and John B. McCue,
the second porter, Â¦which resulted in the
arrest of McCue on" charges of disturbing
the peace and battery. Many of the most
prominent guests in the hotel were wit
nesses to the affair, and when the cases
come up for trial before Justice of the
Peace George Rodden next Tuesday they
may be required to appear as witnesses
In behalf of the defendant.
â¢ The trouble started about 7:40 a, m., just
as many prominent business men were
leaving the hotel to catch the early train.
Half an hour before McCue had been dis
charged because, as he claims, he had
been forced to throw a burglar out of the
hotel on last Tuesday night, and Man
ager Halton did not w r ant him to tell the
story to the guests, who had become
frightened. Halton claims that he dis
charged McCue because the latter was un
ruly and loud-mouthed and had more than
once made trouble about the office.
When Manager Halton notified McCue
that his "services were' no longer wanted
about the hotel" the latter demanded lu
know why he had been discharged and
asked for a recommendation. The man
ager' denied both the demand and the re
quest. A dispute followed, which resulted
In Halton telephoning to City Marshal
Heaiy for assistance.
McCue left the office, but reappeared
half an hour later. Just as the business
men were preparing to take the early bus.
He again demanded to know why he had
been discharged and denied a recommen
dation of good service. Being again met
with a refusal he declared that the man
ager was unfair, a hypocrite and numer
ous other things. Halton told him to keep
quiet and keep off the place, but McCue
would not down.
The men closed in and it looked as if
blows would surely be struck. Halton
seized the porter by the shoulder and then
put his hand back as If to draw a pistol.
McCue placed both hands against the
manager and repeated his previous as
sertion, but gradually backed, out of the
hotel and climbed into the bus. which
drove off to the station. He was over
hauled on the road by Constable Treancr
and arrested. He furnished $25 bail.
Manager Halton says he believes tho
story of the burglary, but denies that
McCue was discharged on that account.
The three men arrested Thursday on
suspicion of having slain Mrs. William
Mitchell and her son David near Colma on
July 4 were charged with the crime of
murder at Redwood City yesterday. The
evidence against them is not only cir
cumstantial, based on the existence of a
terrible- and long-HVed feud, to which the
victims and their suspected slayers were
parties, but positive, extending to the
identification of the prisoners by the aged
William Mitchell, their actions at the
scene of the crime and their purchase of
the weapons with which the foul crime
was . committed.
The most important testimony that will
be placed in the hands of the prosecution
is that of I. Bachmann, a gunmaker at 729
Clay street, this city. At this man's shop
the guns were purchased, together with
the cartridges that were scattered about
the house and premises and which were
afterward found by the police. The sale
was made on July 3 and the buyers were
*rank Lemoscher and Caesar Ehlers.
.fc-acn took away one gun. Albert Gayer
was not with them, but the evidence that
he used one of tho weapons comes from
another source.
.The men were charged by Sheriff Joe
Mansfield primarily on the evidence of
William Mitchell, the husband and father
of the murdered people. Mitchell swears
that he saw Lemoscher shoot; that Gayer
passed around and up the hill with a rifle
in his hand and that Ehlers was in the
Imsand house in the dusk of that event
ful night. He says he cannot be mistaken
and identified all the men at Redwood
City. After this story had been told each
man was taken from his ceil and the
charge of murder placed opposite his
name on the prison books. A letter which
contains much regarding the bitterness of
tne feud in the colony of hog ranchers is
also said to have been discovered and will
throw much light on the tragedy.
Bought Guns of Bachmann.
As a completing link in the chain of evi
dence that has been cast about the sus
pects comes the statement of Bachmann,
the gunrr.aker. He was reluctant to talk
at first, saying that he did not wish to
be put In the light of an informant against
his own countrymen. He however admits
that Ehlers and Lemoscher came to his
place on the afternoon of July 3 and asked
to look at some rifles. He showed them
many and they finally purchased two
weapons, both 32 caliber, shooting a 32-44
bullet. They paid for a box of cartridges
and then left his place. From his conver
sation, which was closely guarded, Bach
mann intimated that the accused had
talked much of the crime and that their
guilt was known from one end of the
Swiss colony to the other. To-morrow he
will make a complete statement to the
police and Sheriff Mansfield will come to
this city on purpose to subpoena him as a
witness.
The shots that brought the unfortunate
woman and her son to their fate must
have been fired from these guns. Tl-e
empty cartridges found on the floor of
the Imsand house are proof of this.
Mitchell Protects His Dog-.
There is. however, one piece of evidence
which the officials cannot secure without
the taking of another life. Mitchell's dog
that was shot carries- a bullet somewheru
in its body. Its limbs are paralyzed, but
â¢t still lives. Sheriff Mansfield suggested
the killing of the canine that the leaden
missile might be extracted and introduced
as evidence, but Mitchell refused to per
mit this, saying that the dog had been a
faithful creature and that nature mu3t
take its course in the extermination of Its
life. - .
The three accused men still refuse to
talk. They have been asked to make
statements, but remain as silent as the
tomb concerning the terrible crime. Yes
teraay they asked to see an attorney, but
none has as yet been employed. They
seem, however, to begin to realize the
seriousness of their position. When the
charge of murder was placed against
them all were visibly perturbed.
The first legal procedure will be taken
at the Coroner's inquest, which will be
held at Colma a week from to-day. A
Jury consisting of J. H. Imwalle. M. Grif
fin. A. Mogani. P. Armannlo. John Rodg
ers, Alfonso George, John Blggio, V. J.
Hohman and Fred Pierce of that town
has been chosen by Deputy Coroner
Claude Fox to serve. All the evidence
now in the possession of the police will
be presented at that time.

MURDER CHARGED
AGAINST THREE OF
COLMA SUSPECTS
HE LETT HIS HAPPY JOB FOB HER.
WALTER JONES, the gay, light
hearted "tramp" of the vaude
ville stage, found .Dunne & Ry
ley's company too small to con
i tain himself and Norma Whalley and yea
! terday he severed his connection with the
company and left on the evening overland
for Chicago. To a few Intimate friends
he confided the fact that he was engaged
to a wealthy young Â¦woman there, whom
he would marry soon after his arrival.
Each member of the company playing at
the California Theater received a note
from Jones yesterday announcing his de
parture and expressing his regret. In
some of them he hinted that the recipient
knew why he did not care to stay in the
j company. Jones Is very popular with the
I members of the craft, and general regret
. was expressed. The girls of the com
pany even shed copious tears over the de
parture of the handsome comedianâ all
j but Miss Whalley. She maintained an im-
J perturbable manner and made no com
ment on the action of her former part
ner in vaudeville.
Some months ago Walter Jones and
Norma Whalley were doing a sketch at
the Orpheum which was the best draw
ing card on the programme. Oft the stage
they were seen much together, and the
gay fellows who sought to win the favor
I of the beautiful English girl found Jones
j a stumbling block in their way. But she
j liked the gayety of the tov.-n and accepted
1 attentions to such a degree that an es
! trangement between her and Jones re-
I suited.
Two months and a half ago their sea
son at the Orpheum here closed and they
went to Los Angeles, the next place on
the circuit. In less than a week the vi
vacious Norma left Jones and returned
to San Francisco, breaking the vaudeville
team and leaving Jones desolate. There
were attractions here for her with which
Los Angeles and the society of Jones
could not vie.
After a short stay here Miss Whalley
wen * to New York and signed a contract
with Dunne & Ryley. but she soon broke
that to go to London, it was said, with
the approval and financial aid of her
many admirers.
Jones came to San Francisco later and
joined Dunne & Rylev upon receiving as
surance that his former flame would not
be a member of the company.
\,\ n s ?^i c way things did not go well with
Miss \\ halley in London, and a week ago
last Saturday night when the perform
ance was In progress at the California
she swept into the theater attired in one
of the latest London creations in the way
of a gown and took a seat in a box. The
people on the stage were astonished at
her appearance when they supposed her
In London, and only vigorous propiptings
Kept the plot moving. The mummers say
that throughout the play Walter Jones
had her undivided artcntion. though he
seemed oblivious of her presence.
It was soon whispered about that Miss
\\ halley had come back on account of
Jones and was ready to be reconciled.
However that may have been, Jones'
heart was flinty. He kept out of the way
of his former partner and did not hesitate
to say that she had caused him too much
troublefor a reconciliation to be possible,
i. Jo ". e^ misery was complete when he
heard that Miss Whalley had been taken
back by Dunne & Ryley to fill the engage
ment that she had broken in New York.
\\ hlle there was nothing specified In his
contract, he felt that as he had joined the
company with the assurance that he
would not have to be associated with Miss
\\ halley, he could not be expected to re
main to complete his engagement,
Followlni?>-the estrangement Jones had
re-newed an acquaintance with a fair ad
mirer in Chicago and had become engaged
to marry her. She heard lately of
Norma A\ halley s return to San Fran
cisco, and Thursday Jones received a
suave but firm little note from her with
the ultimatum that he must not remain
with Dunne & Ryley If Miss Whalley
should be reinstated.
Jones has not confided the name of hia
betrothed to even his Intimate associates
. but has said that she is not an actress
! and Is wealthy. He says he does not ex
pect to give up the stage after his mar
riage. The date of the wedding was also
j left Indefinite, as Jones was particularly
j desirous that none of his stage asso-
elates should know of his intended depar
ture.
He made his preparations quietly and
coached an understudy to take his unim
portant part, that of the old stage-door
tender in "A Day and a Night." Not a
member of the company knew until the
notes were received yesterday that the
popular comedian contemplated breaking
his engagement with Dunne & Ryley.
"I am very scrry," said John Dunne last
evening, "that Jones did not come to me
and tell me what he Intended doing. Some
way to avoid the trouble might have been
found. Walter Jones is one of the best
hearted follows alive, and we are all
sorry to lose him from the company."
But Jones is gone, and an understudy Is
