while you are addressing him. aÂ«fi man
ages to catch your meaning fairly well.
Just how much ho hears is o;>en to ques
tion, and the Secretary of the Treasury,
for one, has his own suspicions tliat
"l'i:cle John" is not quite so deaf us he
appears. It happened this way. as related
in Success;
Mr. Ketcham had b?cn in Congress so
long that he had used up al! the patronage
to which he was bhllUed! dm! couldn't S*H
any more places for his constituents. Uut
one day this spring he called on Mr. Gage.
'There Ls a man up in my town," l he-ex
plained, "who must be fixed, and 1 want
you to fix him."
"I Can't do it," replied- Gage (and up
went Ketcham's hand to his ear), "be
cause there are no vacancies In my de
partment."-
"Yes, that's what he wants." said
Krtcham. "place in your department."
The Secretary looked at his visitor in
tently and said, in a lower torn*:
"The civil service rules cover all ap
pointments under 512uO or JliiCKt a year."
"Thai will be satisfactory. He will not
expc ct more than SlUUO a year."
Mr. Gage was growing desperate.
"1 Ml you," he fairly yelled. "I can't do
anything for your man. There is no use
brirging him down here."
"AH right." said the imperturbable Con
gmsman, ris-ing. 'Til bring him down."
ar.d out he walked, leaving the Secretary
a state of collapse.
Sure enough, a day or two Inter the deaf
man walked in with a constituent.
"Here is my friend that you promised
to :>lace." he said.
"Good I^ord." said Onse' (and up went
the other's hand), "didn't 1 tell you I
could d) nothing, absolutely nothing?'
"Hey?"
"L>idn't I tell you not to bring your man
here, because I had no place for him?"
"No; ycu said you would give him a
place at about $1200; so I sent for him. and
here he is."
The Secretary was in despair. He looked
the Congressman in the faceâ it was a
blank. In sheer desperation he tapped a
teil for an assistant, told the latter to
Like the constituent to Mr. Bâ . and. if
possible, ta find him a place. The Con

A MAN
WITH AN EDUCATED
BIKE
LOOK out tor the man with the new
bicycle,
lie may start in to tell you all
about it.
The man with the new baby, thf man
with the smart boy and Die man who has
just invented a new kind of machine to
prevent whiskaderos from blowing out the
Eras, all get out of the way when the
man with the brand new bike rolls in on
his windjammed rubber p'pes.
Percival Erown has one of them with
'steen patent attachments on it.
There is a wonderful lamp to begin with
that would set Aladdin on the keen jump
if it e'er caught his eye. This lamp
throws the moon and stars all in Iba
shade and makes the risjriff sun look Hkc
a total eclipsÂ»e.
Then it lias a steel spring, double back
action buck-em-off brake on the hind
wheel and a stop-mc-quick on the front
wheel that puts a Westinghouse air brake
back on t^e ice wagon.
Brown's wheel has everything but in
tellect. An educated pis Isn't In it with
that bike vhen it comes to a question of
intelligence
If Brown forgets to jissle his feet, do
you suppose that wheel stops? Not much.
It goes right ahead sawing wood until
it comes to an upgrade, then if Percy
doesn't wake t'p the wheel instead of run
ning back downhill again, jusl puts on Its
own brake, deposits him on the ground
and then lies di wn. Smart v.-heel, isn't it?
Percival has romething like three hun
dred and sixty-1've friends, and in telling
them about the -*hecl and answering the
numerous questions it keeps his mouth
so dry tJyit he t->s to buy drink tickets
by the lftckage. _,
The other day he struck a hard graft.
He had just come in from a redhot scorch
to the cliff and back without a stop except
for refreshments. s>nd was going in to
Hash one of his tickets on a man with
a poker face and r white apron, when
a corn huskcr from the interior stoppeJ
him. saying: "Yer ch.-m's off. Mister."
This was what P. B. E.^q. lined. It gave
him a splendid cham i to explain that
the chain was not off, but that the* man
was and then to follow that tip with a
special verbal edition o' "The Chainlcsa
Bike and How to Work II."
After P. B. had nearly completed tellirg
the. very unusual merits of his particular
brand of bike, the man from the moun
tains got confidential and explained that
he had never ridden anything more com
plicated than a donkey; that this machine
was the first one of the durned things
that he ever saw and had a chan^t to
look at., and he wanted'to know what that
hose pipn was on the wheels for.
That v.-as getting back to lrrst prin
ciples, bu* Percival was patient and ex
plained thÂ« origin of the pneumatic tire,
but when fr<*. came to telling about pump-
Ing air into it to inflate the tire, it was
too much for the donkey man, who ex
claimed, "Gr<Â», Mister, you don't mean
to tell me tha.t you blow wind In there
hard enough to make tha.t hose pipe like
that? I've seen wind blow pretty, hard,
but I never saw it blow quite as hard as
a rock before. You can't fool me,
stranger, if I am from the hills."
There was no other way to convince
him than to deflate the tire and then
pump it up again.
There was a good-sized crowd around
by this time and Brown was busy an
swering questions about what made the
wheels go round when the cranks didn't,
and what made the coaster brake work,
and how he managed to get a whole gas
factory into the size of a tomato can.I hate practical jokes as a rule, but
there is one that I remember with grati
tude. I was staying in a country house,
and there was a man there who mado
himself most odious. He was an exceed
ingly conceited man, who talked for tho
whole room, and bored every one with
long-winded stories. How our hostess
could endure him I never could make out,
but she was devoted to him. "When he
was not engaged in holding forth at largo
he used to try to monopolize me, and pes
tered me with odious attentions. I hated
this first because I disliked him, and sec
ondly because there was anotherâ whom
I preferred. Mr. Bumpsher was totally
impervious to snubs, did not mind inter
rupting a quiet tete-a-tete, and did not
object apparently to being an unwelcome
third. Can you imagine a more horrid
man? One evening he was boasting about
his power of will and the wonderful things
he had done by It, when a quiet man took
him suddenly up and offered to bet him
sixpence that his own will was the more
powerful of the two.
"I will prove it this way," said tho
quiet man. "You will go and stand in
that corner arÂ«l I will will you to come
out of it. Yen will against me, and I'll
bet sixpence that I will have you out of
that corner willy nilly befora I have com
manded you to come out twice."
Bumpphcr took the bet and put himself
in the corner. The quiet man said in a
commanding voice:
"Com? out o\ that corner."
Bumpsher {jrinned and shock his head.
The quiet man sat down and looked at
Bumpsher steadily. I suppose five or ten
minutes passed, and then Bumpsher said,
with a sneer:
"Hadn't you better give it up? I doD't
feel, any influence at all, and I can't stand
here all the evening."
"There is no hurry." said the quiet man,
"and I have a very comfortable seat.
There is no time limit, except that you
are to ctJme out before I ask you twice,
and as I don't intend to ask you the sec
ond time until this day week, I think you
will feel the influence before then."
There was a general shriek of laughter,
and Bumpsher came out looking very
foolish. He avoided the quiet man for
the rest of the visit, and as the quiet man
was.the other I have alluded to, I was re
lieved of Mr. Bumpsher's attentions en
tirely.âL,ondon Madame. -

Inch frame with seven Inch cranks and an

into dispute as to why a chain wasn't

I tfoiy Joe and the Aieutenant.
j In the early days of the United States
navy the enlisted men frequently grum
bled at the treatment they received from
their officers, but, as is invariably the
case, no one else could abuse their su
periors within hearing without being
called to account, and most severely, too.
One of the navy legends is an incident said
to have occurred in a foreign port. An
English and a Yankee man-of-war were
at anchor in the harbor, and a boat from
the American frigate was tied up at the
landing stage awaiting the return of the
lieutenant it had brought ashore; at the
same moment the chaplain of the British
ship was pacing the stage, signaling for
a boat to take him off. The American
officer at last tacked down the street and
tumbled down the gangway to the stage,
showing the indisputable effects of the
profligate hospitality that had been ex
tended to him ashore, and opened a con
versation with the "sky pilot," in the
course of which the latter objected to the
lieutenant's condition.
"As you are an advocate of water you
ought to live in It. not on it," the Yan
kee thickly remarked, and dealt the chap
lain a blow that toppled him into the
bay.
Of . course, charges were preferred
against the American and he was court
martialed. The nine jackies comprising
the crew of the Yankee cutter were wit
nesses, nnd swore to their testimony with
an Rir of ingenuous truthfulness that
made even the stern members of the court
chuckle inwardly.
"You see, captain." said the cockswain,
the first witness called, "the lieutenant
was on the stage, all peaceable and sober,
where we hauled alongside, when the
.'Holy Joe' hove in sight with a heavy
lirst each way and very much down by the
head. He let fly at the lieutenant, who
dodged, and the chaplain fell overboard,
having lost his balance. And that's all
there was to it."
The other eight men solemnly corrobo
rated the cockswain's testimony, and the
Yankee officer w:i3 acquitted.

of grinning strangers who think it funny

didn't that fool of a best man. just to be
smart, go and upset all our cherished
plans and have us followed around like
a couple of prize monkeys In a dime mu

"We managed to smuggle our trunks to

CALLTfiR Chinese province of Shantung,
the home of the Boxers. Is. in fact,
a creat island. I-.ong before tbe
construction of the Grand Canal cut
It entirely off from the main land the
Great YHlow River Uloang Ho) rushed
out of the Western Mountains and split
Itself apaJnst the rocky hills of Shantung,
dividing Its waters. One half flowed
north to rmpty into the Gulf of Pechili,
while the other half turned south Into tho
Yellow Sea. Karlier than this the sea
Itself had covered the lowlands, but the
deposits of silt borne down from the rich
plateaus of Shensl and Shansl by the
river have gradually forced the salt wa
ters back.
The location, soil and climate of Shan
tung have been singularly adapted to the
rfevelnprr-ent of a sturdy and virile race,
end the province has been noted as the
home of China's greatest warriors and
pages. The tomb of Confucius, within its
borders, is the mecca of all educated
Chinamen. The province has also been
noted as the place of origin of nearly all
of China's great fecret societies, and it
has long been notorious for revolts and
reditions. It is not at all surprising, when
you know the character of the people and
their history, that the Boxer movement
started In Shantung.
In the eastern part of the province, up
!n the mountains which part the waters
of the Hoansr Ho. lies the prosperous vil
lage of Fel-Cheng, near which the Boxers

piled by those who. like many earlier Chi-
nese Intriguers, have simply used the
already organized secret society to ac
complish their purposes. It will not do
to believe too much of what Is told of the
rabid anti-foreign sentiment among, the
Boxers. At Taian, right In the heart of
their home country, for over twenty
years a most successful mission has been
maintained, and one of their largest na
tive congregations Is in the village of
Fei-Cheng before mentioned. Neither
the missionaries nor the native Christians
at these points were disturbed.
It seems strange ir the Boxers were
starting out on a mission of extermina
tion that they did not begin with the for
eigners nearest at hand, or why; if they
had overlooked these, that they should
attempt to force a difficult passage north
across the flats and marshes .Instead of
attacking the treaty port of Chcfu or thÂ©
German settlement at Kiaochau, both of
which were near and easy to reach. After
leaving their province, the first point the
Boxers struck was Chen-ting-fu, a large
city lying at the foot of the mountains
near the western boundary of Pechili.
Chen-tlng-fu is an old city and has- one
of the finest ancient temples to be found
in China, with an Immense bronze Buddha
over sixty feet high. The Catholics here
have a large mission, claiming over 30.000
converts, and a fine cathedral. "When thÂ»
Boxers attempted to loot it a pitched bat
tle occurred with the native Christians,
in which the Boxers were beaten with a
loss of seventy killed. The Catholics
claim a million converts all told in China.
Advancing northeast about fifty miles, the
Boxers reached Pang-unÂ«-tu, the capital
of the province, which lies about eighty

Plunder the Original Motive.
There can be no doubt that the chief
Tnotive at the beginning of the present
<JpmoTistratIon was the hope of rich
plunder In the great province of Pechlll,
which lies north across the marshy plains
of the Yellow River. The political com
plexion of the movement has been sup-
miles due -west of Tientsin, with which It
Is connected by river. Pang-ting-fu was
the present terminus of the Luhan Rail
road, being built by the Belgian syndicate
from Peking southwest to Hankow, a dis
tance of about SOO miles. At Pang-ting-fu
the Boxers ignored the presence of a large
body of American missionaries, but at
tacked the party of Belgian engineers en
gaged on the road, and pursued them
when they attempted to escape down the
river to Tientsin, finally cutting off and
killing several of the party.
To this point the Boxers held their
forces together, but here they sepm-atea,

It is because of this absence of active re

At first MghMtmay Wfm singular that
belief in such gods should have been the
prlmary cause of the present:. trouble In
China, yet â¢ such ' appears to be the fact.
Among the Boxers are many skeptics, but
there are also many faithful followers of
Buddha and Confucius, and these latter
have* long been opposed to the Christiana
in China, since they saw that their relig-
Ion waa directly opposed to their own so
far as the doctrine of ancestor worship
was concerned. For this renaon they have
never ceased, to mock at the Christians.
' They have- nicknamed their, religion
"The Squeak of the Celestial Pig." and
they have derided the most sacred cere-
monies of the Christian church. Far and
v.Mde they have spread a rumor that the
holy communion Is merely a philter,
which makes the people the slaves of tha
priests, and that the latter, while admin
istering extreme unction, avail thtm
selves of the opportunity to cut out tha
eyes of the dying. At one time it was
supposed that only a few ignorant fanat-:
les acted in this manner, but -now it lsi
paitl on excellent authority tr.at a, similar!
feeling of hostility toward the Christian*
has been growing for some time amoncr
educated Chinamen, of whom there arau
many among the Boxers, and that thai
sole reason is because they regard th3
Christian religion as directly antagonistic?
.to their ov/n ancient faith, and especially*
to the doctrine of ancestor worship. '
Whether this worship is idolatrous or
simply reverential is not very clear but
a close study of Prince Uchtomsky's 'book
stems to show that It i* both, though
possibly it may be more idolatrous in one
country than in another. This very aues-i
tion was submitted to the Pope some t!ma
ago. and after much thought he decide!
that the manner in which ancestors wero
worshiped in China savored distinctly i '
idolatry. The result waa that the Catho
lics in that country at once set their fare*
against Â¦ it. and the Protestant* quickly
followed their example. .

PROVINCE OF SHANTUNG
WHERE THE BOXERS BEGAN
THE civilized world knows that there
are eleven millions of so-called Box
cit in China, who are insanely hos
tile toward foreigners and who have
tflyplayed this hostility by most barbar
ous act*, but few seem to know the ex
act reason? which have impelled the Ce
lestials to such sanguinary deeds. A3 a
guide lh this direction a book which has
Just been published In Germany and
â¢which throws much light on the religious
views of the Boxers will prove of service.
The book is. In brief, a record of the many
religious emblems, symbols, statues and
painting* which were collected by Prince
E. I'chtomsky. the distinguished Russian
scientist, during his recent travels in the
East.
The Prince tells us much that Is new
about religious life in China and the il
lustrations which accompany this article
show a few Â«jf the strange gods that are
â¢worshiped in that country. Of this wor
ship a cardinal feature is a belief in the
rebirth or regeneration, and another fea
ture, almost if not quite as important, is
the belief that under all circumstances
the utmost reverence is due to one's an
cestor!. Hence among the Chinese del-,
tics is a god of the dead, who is supposed
to safeguard the interests of persons
after they ieave this world, and the.re Is
also a god of hell, whose duty is to punish
the wicked and to reward the pood.
This latter deity, it Is said, was once
a great criminal himself, and on account
of his Bin? he is Ftill bound to swallow a
certain quantity of molten metal every
twenty-four hours. In t--pite of his pec
cadillos on earth, he is highly honored
by Chinamen, since they know that as su
preme lord of hell he can mete out to
thrm cither rtiost dreadful punishments
or most desirable rewards, the latter al
ways taking the form of fortunate re

11THESE men rang . the alarm bell,
which awakened the drowsy old
JJ giantess China from her sleep that
had lasted for ages.
It 13 almost directly owing to them that
the war of the century, perhaps TUB
war of the world has its origin.
Spick and span, in silk, satin and velvet,
here are eleven of the foremost Chinamen
of America.
They are the. lords of a thousand mines,
farms and factories! Their warehouses
line the Pacific. From South America
around the shore line of the ocean to
Hongkong: they have stores in every im
portant seaport.
, It was their enterprise which first car
ried their stay-at-home countrymen oui
Into the wide world and opened their eye*
to the lands which there were for them
to conquer. They Introduced the "Utt'ia
brown man" to the Fan Kill (foreign
devils) and the Fan Kill then reinvaded
China, eager to see the wonderful country
from which came the wonderful little
men.
That Was the start of the mix-up. What
will be the end? '
These are the- men that did It. So say
the Boxers, anyway, for they blame the
Cantonese for the breaking down of the
barrier which isolated China.
They are the presidents of the Six Com
panies, with the man who rules and con
trols even them, Ho Yow, seated in the
middle.
The Chinese are a nation of organizer*
and of co-operators. Ask who is the
owner of a store and you will get a
puzzled look from any Chinese. The Idea
of ownership in severalty never occurs t:i
them. Ask who Is tho head man and It
la the fame thing again. All are equal.
Kach Is a partner; but not only In that
one store. He is, perhaps Interested In u.i
many other stores aa he has partners In
that one. "â¢"
Among us Americans It Is a* much 03
your money Is worth to put it Into tho
average corporation.
The Chinese are perhaps* not more than
ordinarily honest, but they have lttwa In
their country which are Â»ur<Â», swift and
terrible.
WOK UNTO TUB DOER OF EVIL!
No farcical 'trial, with sharp wltted at
torneys crocking Jokes to amuse the
Jurors, when a man la tried for crime in
a Chinese court. No sentence of a ten
dollar fine- for stealing fifty dollars. No
fiu'h thing &s a ytur's free board In a
beautiful Beanide resort with flower
gardens blooming in its sheltered court
yard as rowurd for a fi-lony.
No. The Chinese punishments punish.
With the picture* of tortures such us
are shown on another page, ever before
their minds, it behooves the people of
China to bo good.
That Is why a Chinese feels safer In
partnerships than hÂ« would in business
Alone. One business may fall. Alt can
not. Ills money la aa safe in the hands
of his partner*) as it would be in his own;
safer, perhaps, Lx.-cu.uxe he ntluht gamble.
This la the kind of poverty from which
the people of China seek to be delivered.
It is tempting to the great men of the
Six Companies to see such a condition of
affairs on ono side of the water, and on
the other wages mounting until a laborer
can make as much '\ a day here as would
keep a family for ji month there.
This Is a freo country. Its influence Is
rapidly spreading, until the time will
como when it will be said. This Is a free
world.. And America will have planted
the seed for it. When that time comes,
the strangling paupers of Asia will be
Ire? to roam over the earth without pass
ports or restrictions. Then will the yellow
peril show whether it Is a phantom from
tho brain of a calamity howler,' or
whether it Is a real, tangible thing, with ,
virility to overcome the world.
Whether It Is real or not, though, these
are the men who will lead.
Now they are In a position like that of
the fisherman in the Arabian Nights who
found a cask on the shore and removing
from it the seal of Solomon released a
monstrous genii.
The very people who have been released
are commencing to murmur now that they
are out and to blame not only these men
Who were the head of the movement, but
all of the men of their province as well.
Not only to blame them, but to murder
them by the thousand. For It is not so
much tho Christians who ure being killed,
according to a statement made by llo
Yow. but it is the Cantonese whom the
lloxers are slaying, Just because they
wtro the leaders In the movement to open
China to tho travel und commerce of the
world.
The wealth of these company presidents
and consular oJllcera must be enormous
if the volume of business which they
transact is uny Indication of what they
are worth.
â¢ Little stores of 'some of the members
of tho compuilea do a business of one and
a half million dollars u year In rice alo'ie;
little stores, that you or 1 would not sup
pose were ably to pay their rent, so quiet
und unassuming is their appearance,
it is the cuitbra of China that every
man lias a "wiueeze" on the one below
him. That la a sort of a tax, tribute or
license, whatever one might call it. For
this the e router protects the less and In a.
manner insures him not only uguin*t loss
in huÂ»lneKH but against trouble* of any
sort which may happen to him.
This system uf "tfUUeeces." which, by
(he way, is u word corned into use by the
Kr.glish In china, has a tendency to keep
the. money always rising to the top, and
the hii;iiÂ»T a man eels the bigger his in
come is sure to be.
Whatever their wealth Is, though, you
may be sure that the Chinese will not
iiouht of it. Tiny are. nut u boastful race
in general, and least of alt about their
uiom-y. There is much wisdom in their
ways.

at the great gamo of commerce, even with
their hands tied by thÂ«V disabilities which
the law |mp68<is on them in not allowing
them to vote or hold olilce.
For an Instance of this, lako the care of
one of the largest elg-nr manufacturers in
San Francisco. The firm had a name
whic h was known all over the coast, and
their /roods sold on their reputation.
They employed white labor. The Chi
nese learned the trade anil offered to do
the work cheaper. The offer was accept
ed and Chinese displaced the men and
girls.
The next move on the part of the Chi-
Chinese Ilk* Rumbling; it excites tl-cir
fclusrKl.sh dispositions.
Tho membora of the Six Companies
comprised nearly every Chinese In
America. In union thore is strength,! The
Blx Companks combined with each other

und why they get rich. It i.i co-operation

The golden calf la almost a reality in
China, for tho wealthy Chinese are so
overloaded with gold that they have
Kolden cats for ornaments sitting about

To seek an outlet for surplus capital,
the rich merchants of China projected
the plan of assisting: their poverty
stricken fellow citizens to emigrate to
America.
They were whplenale dealers In tho most
plentiful and cheapest of afl commodities

A human life, which we here prize sd

The trade of exporting men to do tho
labor of building the railroads and woik
lng tho mines of Western America grew
until it threatened tho social balance of
our country, and the exclusion and Chi
nes? registration acts wero passed.
Then came a grand tight in which the
Chinese Six Companies pitted their
strength and money against the laws of
the United States.
They won victory out of defeat by turn
ing" their attention to the trade of MexicoPhotos by f?IlsKy.
that is an important thing to be consid

to starch your wash kimonos overmuch.
There is a bewitching one in white crepe

dotted In pink and lined with pink fou
lard. Sharp contrasts are the rule, you
know. In Japan.
The more elaborate matinees are, as a
rule, fitted at the back, but here again is
a most elastic rule. If you like a flowing
line down the back have it.. The closer
your garment fits the more you can wear
It outside your own room. These lounging
ifiek_ets. breakfast Jackets, matineesâ call
them what you willâ are showing them
selves more and more boldly, but there Is
danger in letting them grow Impertinent.
They were, Intended for the boudoir ana
the home breakfast table, and one Is on,
the safe side in not letting them go far
ther. .
If the matinees fit In the back they arÂ«
usually laid In pleats that V toward the
waist and are caught there by a bow.
They hang full In front, sometimes being
caught in loosely by a belt^ ribbon. Most
of the fluffy appearance is obtained by
trimming the yoke with lace, ribbons or
chiffon or a combination. Ruffle the
sleeves and there you are. Some go so far
as to build a high straight collar above
the yoke, but by the time this Is fastened
the wearer mtist forget that she Is In a
lounging robe at alL A soft turned-over
collar is always more appropriate.
A dressy little matinee and a fairly
warm one is made of pale pink albatross
tucked in the finest tucks. They run
around the sleeve from shoulder to wrist
and they stripe the yoke. The oddest
thing about this garment Is the- yellow
lace that trims It. Pink and yellow have
been tabooed from time immemorial, but
tradition must give ap before such pink
and yellow as these. They, are both so
delicate that they are no more unfriendly
than the little yellow and pink clouds that

These records show that on January X.

during the next five months it fell IS pe*
cent, and In the six months following It
fell 49 per cent. In the next half year tt
advanced 29 per cent. Again In six months
It fell 4"Â» per cent, and In the sama period
following advanced 52 per cent. TherÂ«
was a drop of 6 per cent in the next ha!!
year, and then It rose 13 per cent.
.' Then It rose 19 per cent In three years.
and stood at S2.4 In January, 1S73. In two
years it rose 11 per cent. la January,
1ST3. It was rated as worth S3.9. Fron*
that year, when the resumption act was
passed, the oscillations were less marked,
there being a general upward movement
to January 1, 1S73, when once more a oca
dollar greenback commanded Jl In cold.
, Rising prices enlarged and extended the>
systems of credit, and in 1S73 the bitter
fruits of artificial conditions appeared. la
1ST2 the liabilities of insolvent debtors
reached $121,000,000, and In U73 rosÂ» ta
J22S.000.000. Including 1S73 and the flva

Br^rV Root ptpÂ£S
How many smokers know what their
brier root .pipes are really made of? In
one of those valuable repositories of fact,
the Consular Reports, we find some infor
mation on the subject which will, no
doubt, be read with interest. Our Vice
Consul at Leghorn, Mr. Carmichael.
writes; "The wood from whfch brier
pipes are made Is not the root of the brier
rose, but the root of the large heath
known in botany as the Erica arblrea.
Our 'brier' Is but a corruption of the
French 'bruyere.* " â¢
The brier root industry has had a some
what curious history- First begun In ths
Pyrenees some fifty years ago, it traveled
along the French Rrvlera and the Llgu
rian coast, taking Corsica by the way, to
the Tuscan Marcmma. and has now reach
ed Calabria in the south, which is at pres
ent Its most flourishing center. Leghorn
has always been the center of the export
of Tuscan brier root since the Maremma

South Italian brier Is of admittedly supe
rior quality, a large quantity of the Cala
biian root Is also imported into Leghorn
for selection and subsequent export.
How the brier root pipe 13 mada Is also
explained by Mr. Carmichael, who says
all the root that comes into Leghorn has
already been cut Into the shape In which
It Is exported to the pipe manufacturing
centers, which are principally, at least
as regards Italian brier, St. Claude, in
France; Nuremberg, In Bavaria, and va
rious towns in Rhenish, Prussia and Thu
rlngla. The roots, which are sometimes
of a circumference of two feet, or more,
are cut Into blocks and then boiled. If
there is any defect in the root which has
not been discovered before the boiling
process the blocks are bound to split
sooner or later.
Brier root blocks are cut Into about
twenty-five different sizes, and three prin
cipal shapes. The shapes are "Marseil
laise," "releve" and "Belgian." The first
two are the more usual shapts; from tho
"Marseillaise" blocks are cut the ordinary
brier pipes, which have bowl and stem,
at right angles: "releve" blocks are cut
Into a shape for converting Into hanging
pipes, and "Belgian" blocks, for which
there is bat small demand, are shaped to
fashion Into pipes which have bowl and,
etem at an obtuse angle. A considerable
quantity of blocks is sent to the United
States of America, but apparently non*

As to his own responsibilities, my In

nesslike manner remarked that he "wasn't

looked after a growing family, and he has
a sister that is a saleslady, and could
earn her own living. "People," said he,
"think that the .stores oughtn't to make
us work, and all that, an" they say we
ought to be in school; but I'd jes' like to
know what 'ud become of the folks If we
didn't. Tell you what, we boys aie glad
enough of the chance to work, an' people
don' know what? they are talking about
when they say we ought to be took out

Mr. Davis, the manager, was walking
toward us. "What sort of employers do
you have?" I Inquired. "Do they treat
you pretty well?"
"D'ye see that man there?" he replied.
"Does he look like he'd be hard on a fel

he's always good-natured and knows how

continued, emphatically, "they know how

sons. They always serve free hot coffee
to the kids out In the lunch room, and If
there's much extra work there's some ex
tra pay."
Evidently this was not so with some of
the stores. There were dubious tales of
overwork, underpay and scant time for a
lunch, that had to be paid out of the cash
boy's ov/n slender pocket; and there were
more tales of a pitiful $13 a month being
reduced to a very insignificant sum Indeed
by fines for the breaking of jelly glasses,
the overturning of a Jug of syrup, the
spilling of a bottle of wine, the damaging
of a bolt of dry goods and other unfortu
nate happenings.
"Why, what d'ye think," said one indig
nant little fellow from another big store.
"One day Bill and me run together. We
wuz both rushin' for our lives, and wuz
both In the grocery department. Bill wuz
luggin' a sack of flour to a truck, an' I
wuz carryln' some wine, and the bottle

Bill hed to pay for It. I hed to pay four

that when Bill hed paid his $1 10 fur the
sack uv flour and asked fur it to take

to him. They hed sold it ez damaged

There was no denying the logic. But
perhaps the person in charge didn't see it
that way, and that settled it.

cashboy. Instead of Joy and good cheer,
it means to hfm simply more running,

Late into the night they work, and as the

to lag. heavy eyes begin to droop, and

the call of "Cash" brings them to their

The school room Is In the Young Men's

The greatest trouble of the cashboy Is
his schooling. The managers of the
White House have undertaken to set the
matter right. They have established an
evening school for cash boys and furnish
tuition and all expenses free. At pres

up .with the regular opening of the public
schools. Cashboys are allowed to come
from other stores also, and the school was

that the regular night schools had made a

there is a special gymnasium night each

fellows. When the school season closed
there were about fifty in regular attend

errands and answering to the call" for
"Cash," to be seen every evening from
7:30 to 9 poring over books and figures.
Harry has an eye open for bargains,
and the outlay of his $13 per month Is
made very Judiciously. Some day he
hopes to be something more than a cash

went on It would rank, as Mr. Atkinson
suggests, even above silver and gold.
Before this point was reached, however,
the rise in the value of the mineral would
cause It to be sought after eagerly in
every part of the world, would lead to the
conserving oi me present source oi sup
ply and to an attempt to find new ones.
Men would prospect for potash with
greater zeal than they now put Into
search after gold. The terrors of the al
kali deserts would be braved and men
would bore for the precious deposits - all
over the burning plains of the Southwest.
At the same time, efforts would be made
to gather the product from the scattered
sources of supply now in existence In
some financially profitable manner. Ac
cording to Professor Dittmar the very
greatest of all these sources is the ocean,
and no doubt the brains of inventors and
scientists would be racked to devise a
means of separating this potash from the
waves. In all primitive countries where
the supply of wood Is large potash Is ob
tained by lixivlation of wood ashe3.
This source would be brought Into use,
and gradually the forest trees and such
plants as nettles, wormwood, tobacco and
kelp, all of which are capable of supply-
Ing potash In considerable quantities,
would be burned to rejuvenate the Impov
erished soil. Men would live more and
more largely upon the food plant3 requir
ing only a small amount of potash for
their growth, and a complete change In
the accepted systvm of diet would result.
"I cannot see cause for alarm in Dr. Atkinson's theories. It is
not unlikely that potash beds exist in this country and that they
will be found. At any rats the Saxony mines, it is estimated, have
a supply of 10,000,000,000 tons, sufficient to last for thirty
three centuries at the present rate of consumption. There ia scarcely
any occasion for immediate alarm." â Professor Joseph Struthers

Although the United States Geological
Survey has made no special attempt to
locate potash deposits In this country,
many of the officials of the department
are confident that the mineral will be
found In quantities In tho course of time.
To these opinions one of the chemists of
the Agricultural Department adds the
speculation in potash as there Is In some
parts of the world In gold claims. # Over
one hundred companies have been formed
In these two provinces within the past
few years to bore for potash deposits.
No deposits of any commercial value
have been found and most of the com
panies have failed. Occasionally there
has been great excitement over the report
of a rich strike, but these have turned out
invariably to be false reports. One strike,

eon believes with Sir William Crookei
and Kcme other eminent scientific specula
tors that the great difficulty, when it
arises, will come In. the form of hungerâ
the exhaustion of the world's food supply.
But he docs not believe that this will be
reached through overpopulation or the
taking up of all the arable land. Mr. At
kinson's suggestion, which Is unique at
least, is that the world famine is likely
to come in the form of a potash famineâ
through the using up of the supply of
rotash in the soil and the consequent fail
ure of the land to produce food crops.
It is safe to Fay that most persons never
have taken potash Into consideration as
one of the food essentials of the planet.

"Where is the potash of the United States and of the other conti
nents aside from Europe? The world now depends for its entire sup
ply upon a single mine in Saxony, and yet there should be vast de
posits of that mineral in the alkaline and salt plains of this country.
If they are there it is the dut7 of geologists to find them. The men
who make the discovery of great potash deposits will confer a
greater blessing upon the world than they would by unearthing all
the gold and silver in existence.
tain rocks. On tilled land there is no op
portunity for renewal in the ordinary
course of rotation. It must be supplied, if
at ail. from large mineral deposits.
This would be a simple matter If these
deposits were large and numerous. Inas
much as potash Is found In almost every
part of the world It would seem probable
that such large deposits would be of fre
quent occurrence. But. as Mr. Atkinson
points out. exartly the reverse Is the case.
In discussing the matter before the Asso
ciation for tho Advancement of Science
last week he called attention to the fact
that the world's entire supply Is at pres
ent being drawn from the mines at Strasc-
case of plants which are used for food or
in the various human arts there Is, of
course, a nearly complete loss. The cause
for concern In regard to the question of
the world's future food supply lies In the
fact that potash Is not renewed In the
manner of some other elements of vege

known as the Kali Syndicate, and the out
put is regulated absolutely. Under the
terms of a rigid agreement each manufac
turer is allowed to put on the market only
a certain fixed amount of the mineral
each year. In this way the production
is kept down and the prices are kept up.
There is no doubt, however, that the dis
covery of an addition to the world's sup
ply of potash Is a matter of real Im
portance and It Is likely that the sensa
tion caused by the statements of Mr. At
kinson will lead to a vigorous search for
deposits in this country. If such deposits
of any considerable extent are in exist
ence in any part of the country they un

It is reassuring to note that the con

around the vacant piace left hy Lea.
'iinka had begun to write again with in
creased fervor, as after eveiy crisis iliac
stirred the depths of her sensitive nature.
She wrote in the yellow drawing room,
haunted by the image of the dead girl,
and careless little Ida again took her pia.ee
at her feet, imitating her mother's move
ments of reflection . or industry, while
Carola again went with her father in his
excursions about the neighborhood. The
captain. Mrs. Morley and Lizzie performed
their accustomed tasks. Kverything be
came as befpre except for the presence
. of, Pirnitz, Edith and Frederique. But on
the seventh day after Lea's death Fred
ertque and Edith were to take the train
for Portsmouth, where they were to em
bark upon the steamer Xlmrod for Aus
tralia, and Pirnitz herself was to leave
the following morning for Paris.
It was five o'clock In the afternoon. The
day. like all those that had succeeded that
frightful day, was bright and warm. The
sun was setting behind the low hills of
Paignton. in front of Dartmoor House.
Leaning upon the balcony. Tinka. dressed
in blacK, which accentuated strangely the
paleness of her face and fairness of her
short hair, was contemplating the mother
of-pearl sky, the deep blue sea and the
distance in which the purple evening mist
was already gathering. And, above all,
she gazed at the red rock, Lea's tomb,
which was very distinct just -then, at
the approach of evening. Little Ida. with
a black belt confining htr white dress and
a black velvet ribbon binding her hair,
was standing beside her mother watching
the swallows wheeling around near tho
end of the neighboring pier.
Before the door the captain, in hla shirt
sleeves, pulling and blowing and perspir
ing, was fastened two trunks and several
portmanteaus upon a handcart that had
â¢ been brought from the station by a port
er. The captain entered the house, snort-
Ing, and glancing up at the balcony with
his air of perpetual anger. Then the pale.
Insipid features of Lizzie appeared in his
â¢place. She gave some directions to the
porter and put a little money in his hand.
Then she also entered the house, and
the porter, with the handcart, went away
along the quay V7ith the luggage of Fred
erique and Kdith.
/Tinka again became absorbed In the
view of the horizon, more and more em
purpled and enshrouded with mist. -She
was dreaming so profoundly that she did
not hear Lizzie enter the yellow drawing
room and quietly and actively begin to
lay the white cloth upon the round table
and arrange upon It the teacups, butter,
cake, cream and honey. Ida tugced at
the skirt of her mother's dress and said:
"Mamma! Tea Is ready."
The young woman turned away from the
window and entered the room. Pirnltz
was there already. She was holding lit
tle Carola by the hand and conversing

of her grief. Hue now. in the twilight
of her apcstolic fervor, she relt over

old. forgot recent months wherein their
love hao s.cffitd Id wither, and recollected
only ihelr years of. communion and per
fect affection. Lea's words a few mo
ments before had been the charm that
revived a past epoch! She cou'.d not dis

i-radle. and =ihÂ»-. Krederique, standing

ing the budding thought anu':wSnnlng it,
so to speak; at Its very source; Lea, a

around her shouiuers; Lea. curious aim
gay, quick to anger, but dominated at a
single glance from her sister; Lea, work

i-redcrifiue's office!
A certain spring afternoon in May arone
in her memoryâ why that rathep than sii
many others? It was three, o'clock. The
windows were open, admitting gusts of
tuliry air, and the birds were singing in
the trees upon the vacant plot of land.
Frederique saw herself again; sitting in
her office at the factory looking at her
sister through the open door, saw Lea, In
a gray blouse protecting hc-r mauve cloth
(ires*, standing before her drawing board,
bending 1 backward a little to judge the
effect of a lint. That necting scene rep
resented all the happiness of which their
two lives had Lten capable. ".Mamma
was alive then! We used to return to
gether in the evening to dine with her.
We did not know Romaine then!" She
raised her eyes to the apostle, and imme
diately, in spite of the bitterness of her
Krief and her obscure regret for a time
that was r.o mure, she perceived that
she still belonged to her. that though she
might suffer and witness, those whom she
loved suffer, she would still prefer that
her own life be wrecked, her heart wrjjnpr,"
if- Romalne onlj said. "It is well!" She
thought. "All these things had to he! Ro
maine knows the truth, and i will follow
the truth, which she has taught me in
spite of all! Only I cannot go back to
Paris to live in the house on the Hue de
la Sourdlere and try to cultivate sterile
soil. 1 would rather go to tho end of the
world and expend my efforts for youth
ful civilization. I will so with Kdith,
Romaine will approve my decision!"
"Please, mum! I beg your pardon!"
A boy in a blue apron, with a smooth,
ruddy face and flaxen hair, covered with
a llttl*' round cap. clambered up the stair
case two steps at a time, carrying at his
elbow a basket covered with a napkin.
An odor of milk was left in his wake as
he ascended to the second floor, greeted
by thÂ« "Sh!" of Lizzie and the servant.
It was the milk boy bringing the eggs,
hufr .and cream for luncheon.
"Noon!" thought Frederique She could,
not have said whether the day had ap
peared long or short to-her. Minutes and
hours no longer existed for her. She was
beyond the limits of life, in a nightmare.
The mill: boy. in his blue apron, came
down again, making an effort to appear
penitent. Then Dr. Bryce arrived again.
He seemed gloomy and somewhat embar
rassed np he asked:
"Well?"
Tinka repRed:
"Thcro is no change. She Is sleeping, I
believe,"
lie went into the room. Then absolute
silence again fell upon the staircaseâ a
silence so profound that they heard a fly
buzzing against the imitation stained
glass window. At the end of a quarter
of an hour the doctor came out again,
followed by Edith, her face swollen by
weeping.
They questioned him. He shrugged his
shoulders. '
"She wants to be alone with her hus
band. What does It matter? No one can
do anything fur her now!" /
The curious young man went down two
steps of the staircase, then stopped for a
moment before continuing on his way, and
eald:
"Those among you who believe ought to
begin to pray."
Lea had insisted upon -being left alone
with Georg. and Bryce had made a signal
to Edith to go out with him.
The invalid was suffering from an ac
cess of fever. Her eyes were extraordin
arily brilliant, and the flush that marked
the upper part of her cheeks like a double
spot of rouge accentuated the fleshless
ness of her visage.
She waited until Edith and the doctor
had eone out, and when the door was
AND what about Germaine?" she
2.sk0d.
"Germaine teas Bet at liberty
four days ago." replied Pirnltz.
"Daisy wrote to ttil me."
"Oh! vou received the news, and Â«ald
nothing to me about it? Well, where Is
Germaine new?"
"Thanks to Professor Richardson, the
poor child bu been placed In a private
ma<Jhcus3 at Net;illy. where she will be
r/.jrf-cd until the doctors are satisfied she
cured. But f-ho lives with Dais=y alone in
a little iiincx."
"And who pays the expenses?"
"V\> recovered tho 10,000 francs that we
had dcpo?:it-d as security."
Lea asked nothing more. She had
placed her lip^ against Georg's strong
hand. One would have said that she
clurg to him, afraid of being recap
tured "ry l'!ri!itz anJ Frederique. The
minutes passed In Â«n uneasy silence.
Finally Lea continued:
"So Palsy i^ no longer with you. H't
mair.e. to help you in the new school that
vou are planning?"
FtederiQue's heart felt all the pain that
the divined iirnitz's heart suffered at
that question. Lven tho apostle herself
was tremulous with emotion. She re
plied:
"No one can answer for the future. But
I thirk that Daisy will never Jeave Ger

Apnin tho faint, aliacst ironical, smile

Pirnltz's voice rose firmly in this death
chamber, whence suddenly, by the mere
Ftrcngth of the word, she seemed to have
driven away all the hideousness and ter
ror of death. The eyes of Geonr. Fred
erique and Edith were no longer filled
with tears. Those of Len. and her very

and bitterness. She called aloud:
"Romaine!"
Tho apostle drew near her.
"What Is It. dearestr*
"Nearer! Come nearer!"
With her face pressed against Pirnltz's

in such a low tone that only Pirnltz heard
her:

Pirr.itz led Edith Into the pitting room.
"Fit down there." said Lea to her sister.
pc!r.tir;g to the chair that Georg had Just
left.
Ehe took her hands.
"Listen to me. Don't 6peak and don't In
terrupt me. I have not much strength
left: All night long, half sleeping, half
awake. I thought of our childhood. I saw
you again as you wciie when 1 becan to
understand things around meâ In your
lor.g black cpron. with your black eyes
arid hair â standing near my little bed
looking at me. Did I dream that, or is It
true?"
"It is qultÂ«Â» true. When you were little
I watcSicd you many a time like that. It
Feeroed to me that I could follow your
thoughts as fast as they were formed."
"Yes. And I saw everything through
your eyes. Fcdi. Tou won both my
thoughts and my -heart. The love that I
felt for you was incomparableâ It was not
even to be compared with the love I have
for Georgâ It was not the same thing, and
yet almost as great, almost as 6trong."
"Oh! Lea." flghed Frederique, "have I
loft ycu entirely? Do you not love me at
ell now?"
"Yesâ I love youâ now â Jo-dayâ ever
rlnce I saw you last night standing again
beside my bed iu ycur long black apronâ
you were so gentle with me, and you
never sought for anything save my happi
ness. It Is not your fault If" â
She did not 6ay what was not Fred
erlqi>B fault. The elder's tears, which
sbe could no longer restrain, gushed forth
over the pillow. Lea continued:
"Yes. dear Fedl. I love you. Some time
ago I did notâwhen I was in such suiter
ing In the 1io*pitalâ and even after I was
with Georg again. 1 accused youâ it was
very absurd. I know â I accused you of be
ing the cause of all my sufferings. But
now I see the necessities of r.iy life more
clearly. I ; aai so s!ad .that you are near
me. Give me fonic of your courage- I am
In such grief."
They embraced with their old affection.
"I am 'in such grief! I want to remain
to remain with Georg â 1 want to live for
him! Only live years, like little May
Bpdson. who occupied the bed next to
my own in the hospital! She enjoyed five
happy years with her lover and did not
tare about dying! But I. Fedl, I. who am
so youngâ is Â¦ It not terrible to go away
just at the moment that happiness begins
for one? Feiliâ I implore you!â save pie!
When I was little and you watched be-

Her voice rose, then died away in a sob.
Gcorg nr.j to them and the anxious
countenances of Pirnltz and Edith ap
peared at ih'e door. Lea became calmer
gradually. When she had resumed her
accustomed position, lying on her back
with her head against the pillcw, she
murmured:
"If I were In Paris they might perhaps
be able to save me. Don't you think so,
l r efli? Perhaps a grcnt specialist liku
tibuchardo'n <-n;iid save" me; but It is not
possible to lake rr.<? to Paris, is It?"
Not |ust how." Frederique replied.
"When you are better. '
Lea looked at her sister. anoÂ» the hos
tile smilo\of a short time before rcap
pt-sicfl in lier JÂ»yes.
"1 want to be alone with Georg now,"
she- Enid, coldly, "until the doctor comes."
They ol eyed her. The- doctor was not
long in coining. IMith and Gecrg wer*
the- only ones present during his visit.
When Dr. Bcycc tome out Tinka and
Frederique inel him up on the landing. .
"Well"." thej afk^tl.
"She is very weak. Be brave. It Is the
end. All is t over."
They asked nothing mere, and he went
away hastily down tl.c narrow wooden
stalr-.-Tse. Ti'ika seized Freckrique's arm
ia the gloom and said:
"The end?" He said it was the end! Can
It be possible. Frederique.' Can you be
lieve that Lea is dying'"
Sh<Â» iV.sed S:er pale green eyes to the
somber ryes of the. young girl and clasped
her little hand upon Frcderique'." arm so
tightly that the girl's flrsh was bruised.
Ami among all the dreadful moments of
that f-ariul week she v.-;;s to carry this
one in her memory forever, with such
trivial accompanying incidents as the
sound of LJrycc'-s footsteps dying away in
the distance, the im;;se of the s:aircase
carpeted with common matting, the imi
tation stained gliss window, through
which the- sunlight played and cast rosy
hues upon the wall,' the little woman
with short, curly hair, a doll-like fact
agonized by anxiety, her beautiful eyes
clouded with terror, the tone of her voice
saying. "Can it be pjss.b'.e?" and the vise
like crip of the Blender fingers upon hii
forearm. Tinka'.s words had only a con
fused meaning for Frederique. but they
awoke lev the first time in her mind the
Idea of :i ".vortd without Leaâ that' pre
clpvs *oul extinguished, vacancy, death.
They heard the faint sounfi of articles
being moved in the next room and of j
footsteps. Tlie uoor opened? flooding the
landing with a sudden burst of light.
"Lea v.ants to see the little ones," said
the- nurhe.
"My uaushttrs?""
"Yex. Ida and Carola. She complains
that they are no longer brought to sec?
her. Are they here?"
â¢'yes. they are there." paid Lea. in her
feeble voice, calling from her bed. "They
were laughing upstairs a few moments
ago."
"I will go for them." said Tinka.
Fredf-rique rt -entered . the ruum. She
was struck by the- change In tier sister"*
features, which she had not seen for an
nour. Her entire countenance seemed
pinched aiid thinner.
"It Is absurd!" she thought, "duch an
alteration cannot hiJve taken place in an
hour. I am terrified by the words of
Tinka and Dr. Brice "
Hut Lta said to her. almost harshly:
"The doctor told you that all was over,
did he not?"
Krederique tried to make a gesture of
denial.
"You see!" continued Lea. "You cannot
say no. Ycf; it is tinished'-k is finished!
Is it not strange? Before he came 1 be
gan lo have a litt'.e hope. The sunlight
gave me the illusion thfet life was recom
mencing for me. But all is over! All is
over!"
She repeated this Iiitterly and each time
there was n tob in her voice s-j heartrend
ing that Krederique cculd no longer con
trol hersclt and fell into a chair in tears.
She hid her eyes with her hands. She
longed to hear nothing more, but she
could not shut cut the sound of Lea's
gapping "respiration mingled with Georg's
muffled sobs.
The two little girls appeared, pushed by
Tinka. Frederique then raised her head.
Ida came in Â¦ first." quite "serious [h her lit
tle check print frock, her hair tied with
a ribbon, her slender nostrils quivering at
the acrid odor of the sick chamber. Car
ola followed, clinging" to her mother's
<lrcÂ£*. Lea rose In bed slightly to greet
them. She kissed Ida, stroking her blond
hair. The little one. quite pale, remained
moticnlcsK. wat<!hing Lea Intently. Then
Carola came, in her turn, and held up her
cbeekl placidly.
"Dear little ones!" murmured the in
valid, contemplating them as they stood
Kide.by side at the foot of the bed. Car
ola with her eyes downcast shyly and Ida
trembling and the pupils of her eyes di
lated. "Are they not adorable, Georg?
Happy Tinka!"
A sigh made her bosom heave. Georg,
Tinka. Krederique. and even Edith divined
her grief at dying childless. But suddenly
Ida burst into tears and piercing screams.
She took refuge against her mother in a
sort of tens* nervous paroxysm, sobbing:
"Take me away! Take me" away!" Car
ola. seeing her sister in this state, also
began to cry. and they had to be led away
at once, for Ida seemed about to faint.
Frederique followed Tinka out of the
room.
"I frighten them," moaned the Invalid.
And, letting her head fall back upon
the pillow, she closed her Â«yes.
Alone oÂ»!ce more with Georg and Kdith
she said nÂ«i more, but appeared to sleep.
Georg remained sitting motionless at tne
head of the bed. Edith was kneeling out
of sight of the moribund and praying,
her kindly, 'puffy. -rosy face transfigured
by the ardor of^fier faith. But her lips
let no sound escape from them. The
silence in the chamber was so complete
that the crating . sound of Lea's every
breath could be heard. The sunlight now
filled the yellow sitting room. Georg lis
tened to Lea's respiration and the hor
rible truth seemed to stun him like a blow
from a club: "She la dying!â dying!" And
it hypnotized him so strangely that he
did not know whether It were his wife
or himself who was dying. He looked at
IJea's fingers, lying on the counterpane
at the end of the flowing sleeve of her\
night dress and thought: "Those fingers
are alive now! A mysterious power ani
mates them and stops victoriously the de
composition of the flesh!â And shortly!â
shortly!" .
Wild loving; yearnings thrilled him, like
the palpitating paroxysms of pain that
shake those suffering with disease of the
spinal marrow, and left him paralyzed and
helpless.
A confused sound, made up of creaking
and whispering, reached Georc's ears
"You are to good!" iho Â»ald. "I love
you!"
Their llpÂ» met. In pplte of their grief.
in spite of the' deadly shadow already
gathering in Lea's eyes, It was again the
, kiss of lovers. When their lips separated
' Lea said:
"Give 'me some strength again, as you
did a few moments ago!" '
â¢ At first he did not understand her. fane
showed a little, impatience and insisted.
"Take me in your arms againâ speak to
me in my ear! Impart your strength to
me!"
He obeyed her, and said again:
"I want you to liveâ you must liveâ take
my strengthâ all my strengthâ I want you
Â¦ ' â
And he hypnotized himself, began to be
lieve again and to hope In the accom
plishment of the impossible. It was Lea
who gently pushed him away.
"Listen to me," she said. "You see my
"white dressing robeâ thereâ hanging on
the hook near the door?"
"Yes."
He "went to the door and touched the
flannel robe trimmed with lace.
WherfshVha'fUt in her hands she sat up
in bed with an effort tha: made her lace
contract. Then, looking at Georg. she
said:
"I want to get up.'
He thought she was delirious. But she
""Yes? I'want to get up. Oh. don't refuse
me. I pray you! You will regret having
refused me afterward! Help me! wa
call for any one. I pray you! I can do it
with you. 1 am sure." - !"- -
She freed herself from the sheets with
a sort of despairing energy and threw
back the counterpane. He helped her to
put on the loose white garment above her
long night dress. He placed her slippers
ready for her little naked feet.
"How thin my feet have become! she
murmured. "They were so strong, were
they not? How they walked to follow
you! Don't you remember?â in the London
parks, and even here in the country and
among the rocks."
She Bpoke with an awful air of resigna
tion. Leaning upon Georg's shoulder, she
raised herself, but immediately fell back
ward, exhausted, half-lying down again.
But she gasped:
"Don't call any one! Don t call. I be
Â»eech you! Let us remain alone togetherâ
if you love me."
He acceded to her desire again. At the
end of a few seconds she recovered her
strength and clung desperately to Georg's
coat. He sustained her. half carried her.
With nor right arm stretched out she
pointed to the windows of the drawing
room.
"Take me there, there!" she said. I
want to- see it again; I want to see the sea
and the city."
Was she wandering in her speech?
Georg did not know. but. as If his body
had been animated by the will of the dy
ing woman, he did what she asked. She
walked, leaning the whole of her light
weight upon him. When they arrived at
the window she placed her forehead
against the panes. Her hair, hanging
loose, fell over her shoulders, and Georg
felt its odor awake in him the insatiable
longing.
She turned her anxious eyes toward him
and said:
"Open the window, open the window! I
wantâ the City!"
She clasped her fingers BÂ«<spasmodlcally
upon the window catch without succeed
ing in opening it that he obeyed, her. fear-
Ing to see her fall to the ground struck
down with the effort. The baimy'air of the
sunny afternoon caressed their two faces,
pressed one against the other.
â¢"Uh.it is ufciiciousl" said Lea.
She smiled, enchanted with the view.
The sea stretched oefore them, calm and
smooth as upon <he day when they had
gone to Gilder Kock. glittering silvery
white under the sunlignt. A tew sails
were outlined near the horizon, and the
little boat for Paignton, Hying along in a
ray of light, shone like a big star upon
the surface of the sea.
Lea became anxious.
"The City?â where is the City?"
Georg showed her Torquay, sleeping in
the sunlight, with its villas, verdures, ho

â¢'Why. no!" she said peevishly, like a
Child to whom a plaything has been re
fused. "1 want the Cityâ where we went
togetherâ where I loved you "
She bent over the balcony scrutinizing
the sea upon the side opposite Torquay.
Gilder Rock stood up in Hood like a slen
der boundary mark.. But the line of the
horizon was drawn in blue with absolute
distinctness against the paler sky, un
broken by a single cloud.
"The City?" repeated Lea in a plaintive
voice. "Where is the City?"
Then, as if she understood at last tha
vanity of her desire, she turned abruptly
toward Georg and cast a profound, de
spairing glance at him. A deep sigh
shook her frame, then two more rather
febleer ones. She put her hand to her
mouth, made a gesture as though suf
focating.
'"Lea:" cried Georg.
He perceived that he was supporting a
rigid form in his arms; blood was trick
ling between her lips.
"Lea! Lea!" .
The door opened. Footsteps hurried to
ward him. In a sort of mist Georg saw
around him the big. blue eyes of Hocdcl
encircled in their gold rimmed spectacles,
t'.e terrified faces of Frederique, Tinka.

CHAPTER V11I.
Lea had been dead a week, sleeping face
to face with the sea. in tne piace that
she had s-elected for her last abode and
where -it had been her destiny to be made
a woman in a superhuman effort to at
tain the conjugal equality of the future.
She was sleeping fac to face with the
sea. reclining as at the moment of that
initiation. A reddish stone, torn from tho
rocks she had climbed with Georg. covered
her body, u horizontal tablet, bearing a
cross cut into it. Below this cross were
engraved in the Finnish tongue the sirnpio
Â¦words:
with Professor HoedeL Tinka remained
for a moment watching the apostle a coun
tenance, of which the habitual serenity
was accentuated to-day by a. strange
light. Tinka. who now understood fir
r.itz, as a doctor understands a case to
which he has devoted much study, sur
prised in her eyes something tnat added
to the grief at their recent loss, a terrible
sadness, now at its height, caused by tnÂ»
approaching departure of Frederique.
Tinka knew that Pirnitz, approved of her
departure, regarding neJessary for FTeu
erique's menta.1 and moral welfare a com
plete change of country, a sort of sovil
cure in a new civilization, surrounded by a.
triumphant fcmJninism. tJut Tinita waa
perhaps the only one to understand noiv
keenly Pirnitz would suffer from irea^r
iquels absence.
The apostie was saying to the prore*
sor: /
"Yes. I shall arrive to-morrow night tn
Paris, and after a little sleep I shall set
to work again. I hope this year toÂ¦as
semble my first group of pup!!a. You.
who love work, know how it c.-.ables ua
to bear the trials of the heart afi.l makes
them supportable."
"Of course, of course." stammered Hoe
del. who was always i r: i i oxidated by Pir
nltz. "There was a time when I should
have blown my brains out if I had not
had my workâ and this little one." hÂ©
added, stroking Carola's round head.
Edith came in. She was again dress?d
in her blue serge costume, but without
the apron, and she had replaced the bon
net by an exaggerated flat straw hat,
worn at the hart; of he.- head. She seemed
to be in a fever of impatience. Freder
ique came dov/n the staircase behind h^r.
in a black cloth dress and already wear-
Ing her black felt traveling hat. with
crape veil.
."You are Just like the FrederJqua I saw
landing from the Black Prince at Fresh
Wharf, near London Eridge, three years
ago," said Edith. "But at that time"
She did ret finish her sentence. The
souvenir of the other traveler, also
dressed in black, who had disembarke 1
with Frederique that same day at Fresh
Wharf, had recurred to her. The mem
ory of the dead girl brought a tinge of
deeper sadness to all their faces. The two
children had already gone up to the table.
They were not allowed any tea. Tlnka
poured out for each a g'.ass of miik. which
they drank eagerly. Then, having given
them a slice of bread and butter, she
sent them away to play in the nursery.
"Won't you take your tea?" Tinka
asked the two travelers.
Frederique hesitated.
"Is not Georg coming to take tea. witlx
us?" she fisked.
"Yes." replied Tinka. "HÂ© promised
me. But he asked vou not to wait for
him. He will certainly come down befor*
you leave."
They sat down in silence. Lizzie broucnt
In the smokir.gr teapot and hot water. A
vacant place was left between Fredexiqua
and Tinka for Georg.
Supreme melancholy presided over tnÂ«
frugal farewell repast, the last that
would be taken together by beings who
loved each other and who would soon bÂ»
scattered to ail the corners of tho world.
The moment was pregnant with a sweet
gravity, in that pure, mournful October
sunset. But their courage, their hopes,
remained high. Following the exair.pla
set by Pirnitz all expression of grief was
restrained. There was only the worthy
Hoedel who was deeply affected, and who
polished his sold rimmed spectacles and,
i>!ev.- his ncse noisily alter e% - ery mouth
ful.
Tinka said, glancing at the view of tha
bay:
"Mother Nature is very kind to ns. She
gives us a limpid sky. a calm sea anJ
balmy atmosphere. Kvery time we shall
think of this moment we shall see again
al! the surrounding beauty. But will not
some other evening like this reunite- us
later?"
'â¢Mile. Pirr.itz has promised to corae and
see us some day when we have returned
to Larmsoe," said Hoedel.
"Yes." adi'.od Pirr.itz. "I have a sort of
nostalgia for tbona northern countries,
where X met the most noble conscience.*
In the world. Oh! thar I may once more
enjoy the .sight of those .magnificent gla
ciers and commune with those beautiful
minds!"
"Alas!" sighed Tinka. "if you really
visit us you will find a humble little Fin-
Jaudcr household in the little, isolated ar.i
well heated wood house. And you will
measure the difference between your
great thoughts and our mediocre cares!"
"Do not think that, Tinka,"' replied. Pir
nitz, gravely. "Although the rest of your
life may only call for the skill of tha
clever little housewife that you are. you
will never cease to be useful to the causo
of justice. You will continue to write and
spread abroad the truth, for you hava
genius."
Tinka's pale cheeks crimsoned. She re
mained thoughtful for a moment, gazing
Into her empty cup.
"Shall I really speak words of truth? I
feel opposing currents in my spirit. For
merly I was able to write books that de
fended unyieldingly the cause of the
emancipation of women, because life had
only shown me a single aspect of tha
problem. But now, when certain of my
characters speak in my works, they utter
pleadings against emancipation so violent.
so powerful, that sometimes I ask. my
self. 'Are they not right?' "
"Listen to your genius," replied tho
apostle. "Speak like a Synil. as the spirit
moves you. Certainly the book that you
will write next will be a hook o? doubt. In
which adverse doctrir.es will contend, for
it will be fhu history of a martyr of the
feminist cause, because the memory of
Lea still makes your heart bleed, and bo

It will call the attention of the crowd
to the problem of feminine emancipation.
Perhaps, even, beinjr a work impregnated
with doubt anil emotion more than with
doctrines; it will bo more efficacious. It
will not repel the uncertain, restive spirits
of old human societies."
Frederiquc. who up to that moment had
listened without speaking, let these words
escape her:
"Old human societies! Can they bÂ© con
verted? Can they be reformed?"
"Yes!" replied 1'irnitz with- energy.
"Yes: The work is both possible and
useful, and success is no less certain be
cause it Is as yet distant. Do not doubt
it. Frederique! You are overwhelmed
with grief at this moment. But I make
an appointment with your spirit. When,
you return from your journey you will
have seen prosperous communities found

the sexes. You will have been strength

will not be the Paris of to-day; Europ* Is

Edith listened to the words of Pirnlta,
which stirred her religious fervor, and
she expressed her enthusiasm by. a verso:
"I will go before thee," she said,
"smoothing the ways, destroying tha
gates of brass and breaking the lroa bars
in pieces." â¢
The future evoked by Pirnltz radiated
before them. Even Hoodel's stolid soul
felt its beauty. Time was forgotten. A
voice said:
"â¢Frederi'jtie. Edith. It's time to go.**
They raised their eyes and saw Georg
standing in the doorway. Ha waa dressed
in black, and. as with Tinka. his mourn
ing rendered the pallor of hi* complexion
and the glossy fairness of hjs hair really
extraordinary. His eyes shone, though
not feverishly. He had an air of calm
ness and resolution.
The guests left thÂ© table. The gold
red twilight entered through the three
windows, with the salt breath of the sea.
Toward Paington the sky appeared to
be in flames and ashes. A thick mist was
rising.
The women kissed each other. It had
been decide! that Frederlque and Eri-u
should go to the station alor.e. so a* rot
to mingie their farewells with the trivial
noise of the* crowd.
Georg kissed Edith's cheek. Then Fred
eriquc drew near. AH were silent around
them. The melancholy of aU imminent
departure appeared to be concentrated La
the farewell of these two.
Their regards met. Frerlerique realized
that Georg knew things that she had
never told him. Her heart longed for
absence and the expanse of seas "between
him and her.
They kissed.

from the landing of the staircase. Tha
inhabitants of Dartmoor House were
grouped there and upon the first few
steps of the stairs. Frederique and Tinka
had not been able to tear themselves away
from the door, and when Ida and Carola
had been turned over to the care of Liz
zie Morley. the two women, overcome
with fatigue and grief, sat down upon
the stairs. PlrqJtx stood beside them, her
slender figure seeking support against the
wall. And. litrJo by little, the whole lif.Â»
of the household scorned to >he concen
trated around that door of anguish which
they expected to open at every moment.
LJzzie and the maid leaned over the hand
rail of the second floor, mutely ouestion
inpr them with their glances. The red,
perspiring visage of the captain emerged
from the ground floor, and even Mrs. Mor-
closed behind them she moaned:
"Georg!"
He approached the bed. She raised her
self with an apparent energy that she had
not displayed for several days. Georg
helped her to rise to a sitting posture,
then with her trembling hands she gently
turned her husband's face toward the
window that opened upon the courtyard,
and through which the sunlight was now
ehinlnsr. _
"Let me look at you," she said.
He stooped his tall stature a little. She
put one of. her hands upon his hair, looked
at him eagerly as though she would en
grave his features on her memory.
"Let me see your eyes and lips! Smile
at me! Oh! it seems as though I had not
looked at you enough when I had youâ
when I thought I had you for a long time.
And now! Now!"â
She fell back upon the bed convulsed by
a fit of sobbing. With trembling, uncer
tain movements she tried to draw him to
her.
"Come nearer! Come nearer!"
He kneeled down ajjninst tho bed. so
tliat she oould see him closely. Her. quiv
ering lingers stroked his face, his very
clothes, clutched at (he opening of his
vest and the bow of his tie. as she would
have clung to him unon the edge of a
precipice. She whispered brokenly:
"Keep me! I Implore yon! Don't let me
go! If you will you can keep me."
He felt a mad, feverish hope inspired in
him by the glowing eyes that implored
him, by the burning lips that besought
him. Still kneeling, he put his arms
around her waist; placed his lips close
to her livid cars, put all his longing all
our kiss face to face with the sea! I am
sure I conceived a child of you in that
kiss! He will be born! You see that I

She looked at her husband with the eyes
of one in the grip of a hallucination:
and in that enfevered atmosphere the
hallucination gradually- overcame Georg
himself. Then she slipped down upon
the pillow.
"I am so feeble!" she moaned.
A veil seemed to 6teal over her face, a
veil of suffering that changed its entire
expression, made it anxious.
"So feeble, so feeble!" she repeated.
Her tongue Issued from between her
lips, which opened and shut several times
with a dry, sticky sound. -
"Are you thirsty?" asked Georg.
He stretched out his hand toward the
little table where stood a glass and a
cooling drink. She made an abrupt sign
of negation, and for a little while re
mained perfectly motionless. Georg. who
watched her with Jill the power of his
attention, could not nave said if she were
awake or asleep. She muttered detached
phrasf-s of delirium or nightmare:

"My friend, Harry Williams, and myself
were desirous of witnessing a Chinese pi
rate execution, and one day, by tipping
an under official at a Chinese Jail, we
managed to arrjve on the scene in time to
see eleven prospective victims lined up
for punishment. It was in what.ls known
as the 'execution grounds,' merely an un
usually wide street, with ; no ropes, rail
ings or walls of any kind surrounding it.
On the ground, kneeling in a row, were
eleven pirates brought to justice. Their
hands were loosely tied together with
pieces of rope, and their queues all hang
ing down their backs. _ They seemed not
in the least sorrowful or perturbed, even
almost bored. As the .executioner ad
vanced __ to his duty an assistant preceded
him, carrying j a stake sharpened at ;. both
ends to a point. One end of this stick was
driven into the earth" just in front | of . the
criminal ; then .the executioner's j assistant
caught hold of the Chinaman's queue and
elowly drew him forward and downward.
taking care not to use undue consideration
in shortening the process. When he had
drawn the body sufficiently low- over the
sharpened stick he gave the queue a "quick
tug. driving the stake into the criminal's
abdomen and impaling him firmly. Then
he held the queue unconcernedly while the
executioner raised his weapon and
brought It down swiftly on the criminal's
neck. , severing the [. head from the body.
Assuredly, the man would sail pirate seas

All things' being considered, without undue pessimism, it
is my opinion that it will be a great deal nearer to the judg
ment day before China is conquered. ['V. f. Goi'IlClM.
The only method of creating anything like a submissive
spirit in the Chinese, it seems to me, would be to promptly
seize and put to death all high Chinese officials and dignitar
ies. Such an act zcould break the faith of the Chinese in the
infallibility of the exalted rulers. and the unimpeachable Joss.
Admitting the possibility of food supply by oceanic trans
port service there is the difficulty of carrying the supplies to the
interior. In China there arc no beasts â¢ of burden except the
coolie, who could not well be pressed into service. China's rail
roads and all the railroads leading into China arc in bad re
pair, if not entirely broken up and useless.
Again, in ordinary warfare the spreading of panic and
the striking of terror is a powerful clement with which to sub
due. That is another impossibility in China. The Chinese are
absolutely indifferent to the fate of their fcHoicmcn and fearless
as to their own.
i . DO not believe that it is possible for oil the allied powers,
/no matter zchat may be the plan of attack, nor hoiv mighty
the facilities, to conquer or subdue China. My opinion is
based upon facts as I haz-e observed, them. First of all the im
possibility of maintaining even a small army anywhere near
the Chinese empire. There is no zcatcr to drink, no food ic
cat, and tlu: nearest source of supply is in Japan, three days'
journey â a source that would soon become exhausted. What
zcatcr there is in China is impure and unfit to drink, requiring
to be boiled and filtered, hi China there is no such thing as
sanitation, and at such times. as this war. and beast alike are
left unburicd. Supposing a coast attach should result in the
killing of a fezi 1 thousand Chinese, as it must to be in any meas
ure successful. The dead Chinese would be left unbiiricd upon
the field and ilw army would be unable to advance because of.
the consequent impurifl.cation of all drinking zcatcr and the
stench. And if advance were possible the continued killing
necessary to progress would continue the conditions and ad
vancr to any extent would leave open chances for side attack.
The interior is peopled to the density of szcarming ileas, and
every foot of advance would have to be made over decaying
dead bodies, rendering necessary the impossible zcatcr supply
from the rear. As to food, the enemy can subsist comfortably
upon a small bunch of rice for a week, and the soldiers of civ
ilization zcould have to drazv substantial supplies from the
rear also.

AMERICANS MAY
ADVANCE ALONE
The Chinese Ministers in London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels presented to the Governments to which they are respect
ively accredited an imperial edict dated July 18 stating that foreigners in Peking were "safe under the protection of the court."
tfJot the slightest credence was placed in this by the officials of London and Berlin. Paris displayed equal skepticism and Brus
sels -intimated that what was required was a communication from its representative. This imperial statement, it will be ob
served, does not square with the dispatch alleged to have been sent by Mr. Conger on the same date.
In connection with M. Delcasse's stern reply to the Chinese requests for the good offices of France it is suggested in
Paris that if M. Pichou at Peking were alive the application would have been made through the French Minister. .
While anxious that the advance on Peking by the allied forces should begin with the least possible delay Washington of
ficials do not hold out much hope that the start can be made bfore the middle of August and in London dispatches it is stated that
"a dash toward Peking would be military suicide." Admiral Seymour, however, reports that Tientsin and neighborhood have been
completely evacuated by the Chinese and theJapanese are arriving in force at both Taku and Shan Hai Kwan, which, it is held in
some quarters, will prove the best base for the march on Peking.
phases in this morning's news regarding China very possibly have more or less intimate relation. First, the profusion of
(& Celestial assurances that the legations are safe and, second, the anxiety manifested to obtain the good offices of France
and, it is also reported, of the United States.
In the Chinese'advices as to the situation in Peking there is an "embarras de richesse." One dispatch goes so far
as to say that word had been received from Peking under date of July .20â that is, Friday lastâ by the Governor of Shantung to the
effect that the foreign envoys were then safe, under the protection -of the Chinese Government. In some quarters it was sug
gested that the Chinese officials had overreached themselves'by naming the date, which presupposes the existence of tele
graphic communication with Peking. Taotai Sheng himself admitted that most ot the dispatches, prior to that signed by Conger,
took a week in transmission. Sheng and the Viceroy of Nanking were to the fore with statements of the safety of the Ministers on
July 1 9. Admiral Remey, in forwarding the report which had reached him as to the safety of the legations on July 1 3, expressed
doubts as to its authenticity. , . .

A telegram from Chi Nan Fu reports that a battle has taken place at Tsang Chow, on
the borders of Shantung and Chili, between Tsung Fu Siang's army and the Shantung troops
of Governor Yuan Shi Kai. The latter were'victorious and inflicted heavy loss upon the enemy.
SHANGHAI, Friday, 5:15 p. m., via Teheran, July 21.â The latest news from Niuchwang
described that port as an armed camp. Barricades had been erected and trenches dug. All
foreigners had been armed and were being assisted by seventy Cossacks. The Boxers were
close to the settlement. The Russo-Chinese bank had removed its treasure to Port Arthur.
Two Japanese gunboats and one Russian are guarding Niuchwang.

"THE YELLOW PERIL"â EMPEROR WILLIAM'S PROPHETIC ALLEGORY.
General Dorward, the British commander, says the property seized officially in the native
city exceeds in value 1,000,000 taels. It will be sent to the British war secretary to be held for
such disposition as the nations interested may decide upon.
The American and Japanese troops were the only ones which made any attempt to re
strain the civilian or soldier looters.. The men of both these commands behaved well, the conduct
of the Japanese being especially commendable under the circumstances. The British sent organ
ized parties from the warships Barfleur. Endymion and Orlando in charge of officers to guard cer
tain treasure. It was known that the Chinese had two official treasuries containing over
2,000,000 taels. Location of these treasuries was known. The allied authorities intended to
seize the money, but placed the guard in the wrong place yesterday. To-day when the mistake
was discovered it was found the silver had nearly all been taken away. The British guard began
searching* houses in the settlement and found about 50,000 taels. The search is still going on, and
guards were posted around the settlwrient this morning with instructions to seize all the loot
brought in and also to confiscate alflhvilian loot that may be found in the settlement.
Â¦ The residents of the settlements flocked to the native city yesterday after it had been cap
tured by the troops. They impressed coolies with rickshaws, carts and donkeys into service, and
very soon the roads between the settlements and the city were lined with long processions of

WASHINGTON. July 21 âTwo din
patches from Chinese officials and
or.e from Admiral Remey at Taku
represented the news development
c- the day. so far as the Chinese situa
tion was "concerned. The Chinese dis
patches wore corroborative-or were in
tended to be-Â«f the important news of
vesterday relative to the state of the le
gations. Admiral Remey's dispatch, aside
from a list of casualties, already trans
mitted in cipher form, was most import
ant. It conveyed the disagreeable news
that the international column would not
begin Its advance upon Peking before the
ruddle of August. This notice was re
ceived here with consternation, in view
of Mr. Conger"* advice of the desperate
position the legationcrs were In on
the lfcth.
It is possible to draw two conclusions
trotn a failure of the foreign commanders
to advance. First, the European Govern
ments have allowed their skepticism as to
the r. jthentlcity of Mr. Conger's dlf patch
to Jf~rry them to the point of proceeding
cool,>' and deliberately upon the first sup
positionânamely, that there are no for
eigners alive in Peking to be saved, and
that consequently there Is no need lor
The other conclusion Is that friction Is
developing among the Internationals in
spite of the earnest endeavors of the pow
ers, whose motives as to China , are so
far unimpeachable, to prevent it. Color
is lent to this latter theory by the fact
that the Governments have so far been
unable to agree upon an international
commander for the expedition to Peking,
and this, too. in spite of the fact that
Admiral Itemey, acting by the instruc
tions of his Government, is exhausting
every effort to induce the other command
ers at'Taku and Tientsin to hasten their
movements.
General Chaffee is due at Nagasaki in a
day or two. He will transship at that
point and arrive at Taku in about a week
from this time. It has been suggested
here that Chaffee will, if need be. leave
the other commanders to their devices
and lead the way to Peking himself. His
brother officers in the War Department
say that he is quite competent to under
take this tack. Others declare that with
the small force of Americans at his com
mand the attempt would be suicidal even
if Chaffee were supported by the British.
The details for General Chaffee's staff
were announced to-day. A notable feature
is the inclusion of Lieutenant Colonel
Heistand, now United States military at

CHINESE ADHERE
TO THEIR CLAIM
This map of the East China coast from. Canton to Peking shows how
the astute old Celestial can reach the capital without interference by
the foreigners, unless overhauled by the Bonaventure, -wnlch has left
the Wusung River with the purpose, it Is said, to capture him. By
striking the coast of the province of Chekiang, opposite Haiau or
Kaiyu, he can have quick water transportation as far as Tslng-hal, near
Tientsin, whence he can by overland route easily reach the lines of the
Chinese forces now besieging the allies in that city, and thence proceed at
his leisure to Peking. LI left Canton on the ISth Inst., and after a short
stop at Hongkong proceeded north on the Chinese steamer Auplng, ostensi
bly for Shanghai. That the Bonaventure has been ordered to intercept him
is good evidence that the powers have lost faith in his sincerity.
THE PURSUIT OF LI HUNG CHANG.
WASHINGTON, July 21. â Minister Wu has received from
the Emperor of China a cable letter addressed to the President of
the United States: Part of this letter was sent to-night to Secre
tary Hay. There has been an agreement between the Secretary of
State and the Chinese Minister that nothing shall be said about
this letter until after it has been transmitted to the President at
Canton.
It'is understood here that the Emperor gives the President
information similar to that contained in the dispatch alleged to
have been, received from Minister Conger. The Emperor promises
all the assistance he can give to aid the foreigners in Peking and
intimates that the Chinese Government does not wish that the
United States should join in any declaration of war against China.

Li Hung Chang's present attitude is re

As I-i Hung Chang was booked for

feet in depth around it.
An outer wall of mud made it impos-
Fible for the infantry and marines com
ing on the field to reply to the Chinese
fire. They lost fifty men In ten min
utes, then rushed back from the mud
v.all which they had reached.
Somebody Blundered.
General Dorward, the British com
mander, rushed forward with a frag
mentary instead of an integral skirmish
line. The American mannas and the
"Welsh Fusiliers, together, under com
mand of Waller, were on the extreme

Krench advanced, with the Japanese,
elong the road toward the gate in the
mud wall.
Dorward's plan for the Americans to
support the Japanese was not made clear
to Colonel Liscum of the Ninth United
Rate? Infantry. Dorward lays the blame
for the blunder and sacrifice of life on
Liscum. but Dorward's chief of stuff was
heard to Fay when I-iscum moved:
"Get in down the road anywhere
quickly."
Colonel Llscum hurriedly led his men
through the gate in as open order as
I>OEE ( .ble. They were immediately under
Meanwhile the wounded came struggling
and crawling through the gate In the mud
â¢wall. There was no order. They were sent
anywhere, without men to carry the lit
ters. The doctors were hit by the sharp
shooters while trying to attend the wound
ed of the Ninth. They could not attempt
to carry off the wounded from the bloody
field.
All day long the allies' line lay under
any cover they could find, running out of
ammunition. The July sun was beating
down on them and they had nothing to
drink but the salty marsh water.
Regan was hit immediately afterward
"Get at them if you can," the dying of
ficer said, and added as his last words,
"Don't retreat, boys; keep on firing."
"I've got it." he said as he fell.
At 12:30 o'clock the line had just reached
the shore of the canal and thirty yards
separated them from the houses when the
color-bearer fell. Colonel Liscum picked
up the colors and stood looking around ap
parently for a ford.
"Better get down or they'll hit you,"
shouted Major Regan.
"I guess not," was Llscum's reply.
The next instant a sharpshooter's bullet
went through the colonel's abdomen.
The Americans charged into the flank
fire with rushes. The ground over which
they charged was marshy and lined with
ditches. It was evidently Colonel Lis
cum's intention to rush the houses from
which the flank fire was coming and thus
get a position for flanking the wall.
Death of Gallant Liscum.
Three thousand rifles probably were
turned on them with an accuracy which
has amazed every officer among the allies.

No infantry could charse in the face of

Iner conjointly, neither Dorward nor Fuku

Under cover of darkness the men of the
Ninth crept back from their dangerous
position, bearing their wounded. They ex
ecuted this movement with a loss of one
man killed. The casualties were ninety
one men and live officers out of 425.
The marines lost thirty, including Cap
tain Davis, who was shot through the
heart while talking to Colonel Meade on
the night of July 13.
It was decided to withdraw when news
came that the Chinese were evacuating.
The Russians were not so successful as
was hoped during the day, and the total
loss of the allies was 700.
The Japanese losses were severe. The
Japanese were most pallant in the fight.
But for the Americans stopping- the flank
tire the Japanese loss would have been
much heavier.
The French, Japanese, American and
British troops entered the city at 2 o'clock
on the morning of July 14. Their entry
was unopposed. The American flag at
half-mast was hoisted over the south
gate. The walls were strewn with the
corpses of Chinese soldiers killed by the
shell tire which caused their flight. None
apparently were hit by bullets, the dam
age being done by lyddite shells.
There Is a terrible row over the burning
of the town. Several foreign officers^ are
reported lost.
The tired soldiers remained on the walla.
The natives went looting through the Chi

heavy sufferers.
The American wounded crowd the hospi

LONDON, July 21.â It has just leaked
out that the Countess Russell filed a peti

allegations she declared that the Earl has
been living contrary to law with Mrs. Mol

On April 17 last it was announced In the
cable dispatches that Earl Russell had
been married to V. Mollie Cooke at Reno.

the printed marriage notice, sent by cable,
which appeared in the English papers. 'At
that time It was stated that in 1S90 Earl
Russell had married Mabel, daughter of
Sir Claude Scott, the next year she having
sued him for divorce, making charges of
cruelty and other allegations of a very
serious character.
The matter created a great scandal in
England, and according to the dispatches
Countess Russell failed to prove the
charges, and she was compelled to pay
the costs of the action, which amounted
to over J25.000. -Jler mother, Mary Scott,

English courts, where she had been inva

sailed for London immediately after his
marriage, taking passage on the Ivernia
of the Cunard iine. It was said at the time
that Miss Ccoke had secured a divorcs
from her husband before she married the
Earl. At any rate when the pair arrived
in London, on May S. the Earl took the
charges quite calmly and said his friends
understood the whole affair.

woman whom he had married in America
as "a lady he recently married in the

PARIS, July 21.â "Is it anarchy or war?"
If this question were answered to the en
tire satisfaction of the powers there might
be some light on the future situation in
China, but with the absolute lack of trust
worthy information all are acting in-- the
dark. No one is willing to hazard a guess
as to what the outcome is to be. The
powers perceive In the present tension
of the anti-foreign movement the birth
of a spirit of patriotism which they never
met with before in their dealings with the
Chinese people. In the Chino-Japanesc
war Central and Southern China held
aloof.
Doubt Li's Sincerity.
"Western civilization," said an official
oi the Foreign Office to a representative
of the Associated Pre^s, "is apparently
face to face with a gigantic problem.
This time the powers have to deal not
merely with the defenders of the Manchu
dynasty, but, to all appearances, with
an uprising of the mass of the Chinese
people, who imagine that the European
powers for the past two years have been
aiming not to overthrow the dynasty, but
to seize- China. This seems to have given
rise to a spirit of patriotism. We fear
that North China will not alone be in
volved In the anti-foreign outburst, but
that the Yangtse-Kiang Valley will soon
be caught in tne vortex. There have been
Indications recently whfrh inspire us with
this apprehension. The movement of drill
ed forces northward Is one of them. The
departure ot Li Hung Chang from Canton
northward is, in our minds, a very grave
feature of the situation. Much will de
pend upon the direction in which his in
riuence Is exerted. His reticence and the
absence of a precise indication of hia posi
tion cannot be regarded as reassuring.
"During the Chino-Japanese war, when
tne Japanese were inflicting serious defeat
on the Chinese, the Viceroys of the cen
tral and southern provinces, in which was
a great number of drilled troops, were
instructed by Li Hung Chang not to send
their soldiers north, but at the present
moment these troops are under orders to
march toward Peking."
The French Government still entertains
hopes of the safety of the legations in
Peking, in view of to-day's advices. It
also declines to believe that any discord
will break out among the powers, espe
cially between Russia and Japan. Russia
has her hands full with affairs in Man
churia, where if is pointed out, she has
been taken as much by surprise as have
been the other powers. The invasion of
Russian territory by the Chinese astound
ed the Russian Government, which little
supposed the Chinese were in such
strength or so well armed in the territory
contiguous to Russia.
That no present break will occur In the
accord of the powers is the general opin
ion in diplomatic spheres.
One embassador explained that during
a time of storm one could find wild
animals which ordinarily are the bitterest
of enemies, and willing to. fight to the
death, lying peacefully together in. a
single place of safety. This, he thought,
fitted the present case in China, and so
long as the storm lasted the concord
among the powers vas assured. After
that it was difficult to see the outcome.
The torrid weather in the United States
has had Its duplicate here. During tho
last week the thermometer registered be
tween 90 and S5 degrees, touching the
maximum on Friday, 102 In the shade,
making it tho hottest day ever recorded
In Paris. This extreme heat continues
to-day without any indication of a break.

Issue of Postage.
WASHINGTON, July 21.â The annual
statement showing the total Issue of post
age stamps, etamp books, stamped en
velopes. newspaper wrappers and postal
cards for the fiscal yeax ending Juna SO,
1300, was given out at tho Postofflce De
partment to-day. It shows the aggregate
number of all such matter Issued to have
been 5^S3,SS7.010 articles, valued at J37,
6S7.772.
further element of doubt that has turned
the experts completely topsy-turvy. The
greatest sufferer in this respect is John
Cole, the venerable dean of St. Paul's.
A few hours after the Associated Press
dispatch giving the news of the mes
sage from Minister Conger was published
the Government issued a notice that the
dean's projected memorial service on
Monday for the victims of the Peking
massacre was undertaken without its
sanction.
Simultaneously letters appeared In the
papers from relatives of those at Peking
saying the dean had shown indecent
haste, while the aristocratic Morning
Post denounced the Cathedral dignitaries
in terms almost as strong as It had ap
plied to the Boxers themselves, where
upon the dean got up his back and de
clared that it was too late to cancel the
service, but that, owing to pressure from
high quarters to-day, he had consented
to indefinitely postpone it.
The Financial End.
According to the Statist. Russia Is like
ly to bear the brunt of the financial bur
den of the Chinese case, on account of the
probability that that Government would
be obli^d to incur a large outlay to pro
tect Siberia, while if the Government
should attempt to hold Manchuria the
output would be still greater. This,
however, would benefit other European
markets, as Russian gold would probably
have to be sent to England, Germany and
France. So the money markets may be
relieved to greater extent than is new
calculated, for if Russia lets go of say
20,000.000 or 30,000,000 pounds sterling it will
be an immense addition to the funds In
the markets of Europe.
The Statist says it is likeiy the Bank
of France will raise the discount rate to
2H per cent, and declares that the posi
tion of Germany is greatly improved.
The week in Parliament was marked
by still another backdown by the Gov
ernment in withdrawing the clause of the
army bill making voters available for ser
vice" abroad.
Such a sweeping change met with stren
uous opposition on both sides, and after
pleading for the proposal the 1'nder Sec
retary of State for War, George Wynd
ham. meekly withdrew it. This was an
other instance of the Government's amaz
ing Inability to feel the pulse of the House
of Commons and the nation. The Star,
voicing the opinion of the advanced Radi
cals, approved the withdrawal of the
clause, but fails to see how imperialists
could oppose it, for "you cannot assert
your hegonomy in China, your suzerainty
in Africa, claim the golden ' stool of
Ashanti, teach France her manners and
wield a longer spear than Russia without
courting disaster or fearing conscription."
The hospitals' committee has started the

David Lloyd George, member for Car

House of Commons the other day that
over 12,C<Â«) troops have been sent to South
Africa since the capture of Pretoria,
which scarcely looks like the war is over.
The stem treatment now being meted out
to the Bot-rs by banishing them to St.

war. though the majority appear to be

COUNT BONI DE CASTELLANE.
PARIS. July 21.â Court Bonl de Castellane, who married Miss Anna Gould
of New York, fought a duel to-day with Count Orlowski in the outskirts
of Paris. In the first assault Count Orlowski was wounded In the thorax
and the duol was stopped by the doctors.
The conditions cf the duel were that the contest should continue until one
of the combatants was absolutely unable to continue. The cause of the duel
was a newspaper article reciting a quarrel between the two occurring in Count
Boni de Castellane's house.
Count Orlowski charged Castellane with responsibility for the article. The
seconds failed to reach a satisfactory arrangement and decided that a meeting
was necessary.

LON'DON*. July 21.â The request of Sec
retary of State Hay to the powers to
make aa Immediate forward movement
upon Peking is not likely to meet with
any success in England. Lord Salisbury
is just as eag-e-r as the American Secre
tary cf State to adept such a step, but he
Is practically convinced that it will not
be possible until September, owing to
local conditions and the allies' luck of
equipment. Beyond a courteous reply
that England is willing to co-operate in
any movement that the commanders on
the spot may deem advisable, nothing is
likely to come of the latest American
effort to reach the Chinese capital, for all
official advices received here indicate that
a dash toward Peking in the immediate
f'-fjre would be military suicide.
The Government's attitude may be
taken as a philosophic determination to
grin ar.d bear it. hoping for the be?t, yet
'earing the worst, until troops and cli
matic conditions enable the pov.-ers to
enter Peking and ascertain without a
ehsdow cf doubt the extent and cause of
China's present disintegration. L'r.til
that is accomplished every opinion worth

BERLIN, July 21.â The Chinese siHuation
takes on a radically different shape on
news which has reached here from Rus
sia, What Europe hitherto knew about
the troubles in Manchuria was what the
Russian Government chose to let pass.
Xow a number of reports, some of them
official, jj but a majority private, have
reached here from St. Petersburg, which
tally In the main and paint the situation
in Chinese Manchuria and along the. 1500
kilometers of borderland, on the Siberian
side of which the Amur River forms a
frontier, as much more dangerous for
Russia than has hitherto been supposed.
The Associated -Press correspondent has
obtained at the Russian embassy here a
partial, though cautious confirmation of
the foregoing statement. .A military con
tributor to the Tageblatt says official Rus
sian news showed the Chinese regular
troops, aided by irregulars, in all number
ing about 120.000, are in open war against
Russia. They not only demanded the with
drawal of the Russians from Chinese ter
ritory, but after the Russian refusal to
withdraw the Chinese assumed the of
fensive and drove off the Russians from
railroad construction and are undertaking
hostile operations against Harbin, Blago
vestchensk and other towns, shelling the
last named place. What makes the Chi
nese hostilities extremely dangerous, how
ever, is the fact that the Chinese, by a
series of recently constructed redoubts
absolutely command the navigation of the
Amur River for a distance of twentv
versts, thus Russian troop
transports on the onlv route open, at IeaÂ«<t
until those fortifications shall have been
taken by the Russians.
Though the Russian censorship is again
most severe regarding telegrams, news
reached here to-day from St. Peters
burg that Blaprovestchenskhad been taken
by the Chinese, who seized large amounts
of money in the Russo-Chinese bank therj
Russia Actually at War.
All reports ajrree that the Russian Gov
ernment now considers that. Russia Is act
ually at war with China: that the shilly
shally policy hitherto maintained will be
dropped; that Russia i3 now hurriedlv
preparing for a serious campaign In Xorth
China, separate from the otlier powers
and that Russia will not be able nor will
ing, under these altered circumstances, to
bear an adequate share in the Tientsin-
Peking campaign.
The Russian forces available along the
border and throughout North China are
said to comprise twenty-six battalions of
the line, twenty-seven battalions of re
serves, seventeen Cossack/ regiments ana
seventeen fleM batteries, Vnaking a total
of about/"78,00Â»J men. -
The Lloyd line steamer Sachisen. which
has arrived at Genoa from China^reports

forts and slightly damaged while going

Dr. Mumm von Schurzensteln has gone
to China, nominally as the German repre
sentative for East Asia, because Germany
has not yet been officially informed of the
death of Baron yon Ketteler. Dr. Mumm
goes not accredited to the Chinese Gov
ernment but empowered to negotiate with
single or joint Viceroys, or Governors.
The German newspapers have this week
contained much editorial comment and
news regarding the American political
campaign and commerce, mainly compli
mc-ntary except as regards imperialism.
The Kreuz Zeitung says:
"The United States is now In a new era
of political activity and encountering un
suspected great hindrances and dinicul
ties, but which can neither be removed or
overcome hurriedly. Spread-eagleism is a
species of expensive luxury."
The 3rltish Embassador, Lord Gough,
told the Associated Press correspondent
that all the Cabinets were still acting
upon the assumption that the Ministers
were still alive. The Forelgm .Office has
taken no further steps concerning the
Chinese Minister. Officials there say that
if he leaves he will do so of his own voli
tion.
Newspaper Men Barred Out.
The Chinese Minister has ordered all
members of the legation to refuse to see
newspaper correspondents.
The Chinese embassy here late to-day
communicated to the Foreign Office tho
decree of the reigning Emperor, Kwang
Su, the decree which the embassy re
ceived this morning from the Viceroy of
Nanking 1 . The decree is a lengthy docu
ment and was addressed to the Viceroys,
ordering them to suppress the Boxer
movement and to protect foreigners. It
expresses regret for the murders of Baron
von Ketteler and tho Japanese attache,
but does not mention any of the other
members of the legation.
A report from Hamburg says that de
tectives have arrested the secretary of
the United States consulate at that place
for the embezzlement ol 25,000 marks. Two
American ladies In 1S9S commissioned the
consulate to collect :i legacy of 200,(KK)
marks, of which 50,000 had been already
collected. The ladies being unable to ob
tain their money called, in the local police
with the result as stated. .
The Berliner Post complains of America
that the policy of the United States in
the matter of China is indefinite. This
that newspaper attributes to the fact that
the Presidential election is approaching.
The German Fleet Society will send on
August 5 a news expedition to China for
the purpose of reporting events entirely
independent of English or other news
gathering concerns. The expedition will
consist of from fifteen to twenty men
equipped with telegraph apparatus, auto
wireless telegraphs and heliographs. Em
bassador White's suggestion that the
European governments unite in establish
ing some system of regular intercourse
with Peking has been received by the
Foreign Office in the most friendly spirit.
Embassador White was assured that Ger
many would do everything in her povrer to
assist the United States, but the Foreign
Office admitted that it would be impossi
ble at the present time to carry out such
a plan. >
The alleged dispatch from Minister
Conger and all the other reassuring Chi
nese advices received here are viewed by
the German officials with extreme skepti
cism and Em'ofiFsador White has cabled
the Washington authorities.

NEW YORK, July 21.â William J. Bryan

Republicans contend that had the farm

Dispatches to the Herald from the
States carried by Mr. Bryan show a very
different condition of affairs in 1900 than
was the case four years ago. With few
exceptions, the cere.al crops are vastly

FUSION FAILS IN
THE STATE OF IDAHO
POTATKLLO. Idaho, July 21.â The Dem
ocrats this aftrrnoon unanimously voted
to confer no more with the Populists, bat
to fuse with the Silver Renublirans. This
action resulted from a Populist ultimatum
that the Democrats adopt a resolution
demanding the immediate abolition of
martial law and the permit system in
Shoshone County. â¢ -
When the conclusion of the Democrats
was made known the parties held separate
conventions.
The Democrat? offered the Populists the
Congressman, Auditor and Mine Inspector,
and the Silver Republicans the Senator
and Secretary of State. The latter ac
cepted, but the Populists demanded the
Secretary of State and one elector in addi
tion. The Democratic convention instruct
ed its committee -to refuse to yield. The
Populist convention then, as a prerequi
site to yielding, demanded that the Dem
ocrats adopt the following resolution:
Resolved. That we demand the Immediate
dlteontinuance of martial law in Shoshone
County, -under which the permdews system of
permits to seek employment has been inaugu
rated; and we demand the abolition of said
BVFtem.
We further demand that all civil and political
riphis guaranteed by the constitution and the
laws be immediately restored to all citizens of
our beloved State.
When the Democrats convened they
adopted a platform but remained in recess
most of the afternoon hoping the Popu
lists would recede. Hut the Populists
voted not to recede. The platform of the
Democrats Indorses the Kansas City plat
form and. especially the financial plank
and ratifies the national ticket. It de
mands the election of Senators by direct
vote and indorses the record of the State
administration.
The platform is devoted largely to State
affairs. Senator Shoup is denounced for
his vote on the financial bill and other
measures. It favors compulsory refer
ence of disputes between labor and capi
tal to a non-partisan board of arbitra
tion. It declares for enforcement of law
and protection of all in enjoyment of their
riKhts under the constitution and laws.
Captain Frank W. Hunt of Lcmhi Coun
ty, who served in the Philippines with
the volunteers, was nominated for Gov
ernor on the eiRhteenth ballot.

nomination of Fred T. Dubois was also
indorsed.
The Silver Republicans nominated Hon.
Fred T. Dubois for United States Senator
and C. J. Bassett for Secretary of State.
The Populists held an exciting session
over the rejection by the Democrats the
nifrht before of the ultimatum sent to
th^m by the Populists. They nominated

Rebels Agree With the Government
Forces to Meet Without the
City Limits.
NEW YORK, July 21.â According to a
dispatch to the Herald from Panama, the
chief officers of the revolutionary forces
addressed a letter under date of July 14
to the American Consul here and through
.him to all the members of the consular
corps stating that they wished" to prevent
Panama being the scene of warlike opera
tions, which would be disastrous to lives
and property. The rebel leaders requested
the Consuls to use their good offices to
effect an arrangement witn the Govern
ment by which the latter'a forces should
meet them in battle outside the city.
On receipt of this letter the Consuls
met to discuss the matter. They resolved
to appoint a committee composed of the
American, English and French Consuls to
confer with the Governor, and this com
mittee laid the matter before General Al
ban. who is now in charge of the Govern
ment here.
General Alban told the Consuls that the
forces under his command In this depart
ment would defend the city threatened
by the revolutionary forces and would
fight outside its limits. Part of his forces,
he said, were already in convenient locu
tions for meeting the enemy. General Al
ban added that it was the Government's
desire to avoid by all means fighting and
bloodshed in the streets of the city.
FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED.
Body of a Man Found in Stockton
Channel.
STOCKTON. July 21.â The body of a
man believed to â¢ be James Mehan, a
steamboat mar, was taken from Stockton
channel this morning and removed to the
Morgue. ' y ' "
The Coroner's jury this morning brought
out sufficient evidence to warrant the be
lief that the man was struck on the head,
robbed and then thrown into the water to
cover the crime. The man had money
when seen last and the fact that his pock
ets were turned inside out indicated rob
bery and foul play. The police are inves
tigating the case and hope to capture the
murderer. . >".?.â¢' ;
Date for Cuban Election.
WASHINGTON, July 21.â It is stated on
good authority at the War Department
that the date for holding the Cuban elec

convention, it Is believed by the War De
partment authorities, can be held within
three months after that date.
Machine Invented Which Will Trans
mit Messages With an Or
dinary Typewriter.
CHICAGO. July 21.â The Times-Herald
to-morrow will say: Telegraphy by the
use of typewriters in place of the ordinary
clicking keys and sounders, familiar in
telegraph offices, has been made possible
by two Chicago men, S. G. Sholes and A.
C. Gllmore.
They have devised a mechanism by
which a message written with ordinary
spelling on a machine that has a key
board exactly like the keyboard of the or
dinary typewriter will be printed, if trans
mitted over a telegraph wire, by another
typewriter in the office to which it is sent,
hundreds of miles away.
The instruments have been tested over
a circuit of 665 miles of wiro belonging
to the Central Union Telephone Company,
connecting Bloomington, Springfield and
Peoria.
The- feature of the invention is that
while it receives and delivers messages in
the ordinary alphabet spelling it trans
mits them by the use of the Morse tele
graphic alphabet of dots and dashes. The
transmitter turns each figure, letter or
punctuation point into dots and dashes
and the receiver, which contains an in in
strument called a "selector," turns the
dots and dashes back into the ordinary
signs.
BATTLEFIELD WILL BE

Sacramento Trustees Will Consider
Amendment to the Anti-Pool
room Ordinance.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 21.â Action will be
taken by the Board of Trustees at next
Monday night's meeting on an ordinance
prohibiting the sale of pools elsewhere
than on a racetrack or at times other than
when races actually are being run. This
ordinance is designed to solve the <iuestion
of poolselling at the State Fair, which
opens early In September next. Five
months ago an ordinance was passed pre
venting the sale of pools anywhere in the
city, and under it the poolrooms have been
effectually closed out.
But even those foremost in bringing
about the wholesome reform were averse
to striking a blow at the legitimate bet
ting feature of the State Fair racing sea
son, and various Influences have resulted
in the presentation of the measure framed
so as to exclude the State Fair races from
its operation. That it will pass next Mon
day night and become lav/ is the general
wish of citizens, although it is openly
hinted that the old poolroom crowd will
do its best to saddle it with some amend
ment which shall enable the poolrooms to
start up again.
One way which has been talked of has
been the fixing of a license on the pool
rooms, and some Trustees are said to
favgr such a measure. The people, how
ever, will regard a monthly license tax as
email compensation for the rehabilitation
rjf the poolroom evil,;and from press and
pulpit has sprung a protest.

NEW YORK. July 21. â The Journal Tiaa
this from Ixmdon: An altogether new
complexion has been put upon the Astor-
Mllne controversy by the discovery that
the ex-American multi-millionaire com
pelled the Baronet to leave bis house on
the night of the memorablÂ© concert a
fortnight or so ago because he objecte.1
to Sir Berkeley's suit for the hand of his
only daughter, Pauline.
It was Miss Astor who invited the- Bar
onet to the entertainment, but without
her father's knowledge or approval. It is
wrong, therefore, to state that Sir Berke
ley was at Carlton House Terrace with
out an invitation. Moreover, his encoun
ter .with Mr. Astor did not take place as
he was entering- the saions. It was after
a tete-a-tete between himself and the
heiress In a secluded corner of the winter
garden â a tete-a-tete Â¦which was suddenly
interrupted by the infuriated father.
Sir Berkeley is understood to have gone
to Marlenbad, Germany, where Mr. Astor
is now staying-, with the object of secur
ing the satisfaction which his friends con
sider it indispensable that he should ob
tain. This satisfaction may take the form
of a duel, for Mr. Astor is very obstinate
and a splendid swordsman.
Meanwhile the committee of the Marl
borough Club has suspended action. If
Mr. Astor declines to tight, apologize or
to give his consent to a marriage, his ex
pulsion from the Marlborouffh. from thÂ«
Carlton and from all other clubs of which,
he is now a member is assured.

JESTER MADE DAMAGING
ADMISSIONS IN JAIL
Contradicted Himself After Declaring
That Gates Had Cut His Own.
Throat.
NEW LONDON, Mo., July 21.â Francis
P. Shuck, aged 4S, of St. Louis, Mo., told
this story from the witness stand at the
Jester trial to-day:
In 1S71 I was journeying from Knox
County, Missouri, to Audrain County, Mis
souri, to visit relatives near Mexico. When
I reached Reneick I met an elderly man
and a voung man with two Â¦wagons and a
buffalo calf. I talked with the young man,
who afterward I learned was Gilbert
Gates. He told me he was from Kansas
and was going to his home near Chicago.
He wanted me to ride with him to Sidney,
sixteen miles, tut the old man, who I
afterward learned was Alexander Jester,
objected. He said to me:
"You had better go where you started."
Mr. Shuck said he departed, but after
ward he met the old man driving along
the road near Sidney. This time he was
by himself, but had two teams. Jester
yelled. "Hello." 1 as they passed. The wit
ness said he saw Jester again. This time
he was in the Paris. Mo., jail. Mr. Shuck
said he had seen in the newspapers that
it was alleged that Jester had killed Gates
and he called at the jail to see if the pris
oner was the same old man who had ob
jected to his riding with Gates. He talked
to Jester about twenty minutes. The pris
oner at first said he did not recall meeting
Shuck, but finally asked him if he was go-
Ing to appear in court against him.
"I told him," said the witness, "that no
body knew I had seen the two teams at
Sidney. The prisoner then told me that
Gates cut his own throat. Jester then
choked up and I left him."
Shuck, on cross-examination, testified
that Jester told him in the Paris jail that
"Gates would turn up at the right time.'i
The court adjourned until next Monday,
when it is expected that the State will
close its case.

stitutional convention should be convened

to General Wood.

prevail in Cuba and that troops are Kept
there simply for their moral Influence. He

GEORGETOWN. Ky.. July 21.â The sec
ond we-Â«k of the trial of Secretary of State
Powers, charged with being an accom
plice in the assassination of Governor
Goebel, passed this afternoon with only
thirty-two witnesses hoard. It will prob
ably take all of next week to hear other
witnesses for the prosecution.
Itobcrt NoaUes. who gave such sensa
tional testimony regarding Caleb and
John Powt-rs yesterday, did not finish his
testimony to-day. He will be recalled
Jiorxiay.
Kd Steffee, a. messenger boy, gave the
most important testimony this afternoon.
He saw the assassination and said he saw
the point of a lille protruding from a win
dow of Secretary Powers' office, the 'win
dow beiiifr raised about eighteen inches
and the curtains down.
Noakcs. whose testimony began yester
day, was cross-examined by Judge Tins
ley. He said lie was deceived into a talk
Â¦with Colonel Campbell at Big- Stone Gap,
Va., jirior to his arrest, where the latter
met him as Mr. Kramer, interested in
mining. The conversation led into poli
tics and then into the Goebel assassina
tion. Later he found he was talking to
the attorney for the prosecution. He said
Campbell did not promise him anything
for his testimony. Witness said that he
had an Idea that Goebel was to be killed,
but he thought it would be in a fight, and
imt by assassination. When told by John
Powers to keep out of range, as some fel
lows in the lobby -were poing to do the
work for Goebel when he came in, he hur
ried off to prevent the assassination.
Noakes was re-examined regarding the
trip of himself and his mÂ«-n to Frankfort
at the time ot the meeting of the Elec
tion Commissioners in December. He re
peated that Towers had instructed him to
have his men crowd into the State House
*=o the Governor would have a:i excuse to
â¢call out the militia. When they got there
Governor Bradley refused them admit
tance. Witness reiterated that the object
of Powers and others was to intimidate
the Commissioners.
Witness was Btfll on the stand when the
court took a recess until afternoon.
The cross-examination of Xoakes was
not completed, but he was excused until
Monday, when he promised to bring into
court "his m Lister roll and a cartridge
piven him by J..hn Powers. Senator Wat
ton of Mayli-M was then called.
Ed Steffee, a Messenger Boy, Declares
That He Saw the Assassination
of the Governor ComÂ«

WASHINGTON. July 21.â The Secretary
of War has been furnished with copies of
some Interesting documents relating to an
alleged plot against the authorities In Ma

of San Miguel. Tiie secret service depart
ment, under Lieutenant Charles R. Trow
bridge. Eleventh Cavalry, early in Juno
stumbled upon an insurgent recruiting of
fice, situated in an isolated locality, where
the' work might be carried on without at
tracting attention. One room was fitted
up as an office and a large quantity of
blank forms bearing the headline, "Repub
liauq Filipino" were found in the housÂ«.
In the cupboard, which had been secure
ly fastened. Trowbrtdge and hie men dis
covered a large number of papers, all ot
recrnt date, tiie latest being dated June
7 They consisted of orders from Aguin
aldo and letters of encouragement and
instructions from that leader and other
insurgent chiefs. A document which ex
cited a great deal of interest was one
which contained the details of a plot ar
ranged evidently early in June to excite
an uprising in Manila. The plan contem
plated an attack upon the force in the
citv and the seizure of arms and ammuni
tion. Another paper which is or Interest
is translated as follows:
We will not be slaves. Let the Filipinos
stand together and battle for their liberties, and
it will not be Ion? bet ore the nations of the
vorld will recognize their strenjeth. The blood
of innumerable martyrs bears ample testimony
to the Filipinos" love of freedom and their de
termined purpose not to cease struggling for It.
Shall they allow the Americans to exercise un
rmxerxed sway over the fair Filipinos? If
they do. then the fate of the American red
n.en is theirs, an deventually a reservation will
be assigned to them. Brothers, our cause Is
Just; therefore, let us continue as a thorn In
the side of our oppressors and strike where
we dare, eparlngr neither men, women, children

in hcura of adversity are sure to conquer In
the end.

ULFHEIM.
(Confidently)â Of course I do.
MAIA.
(Putting on her hat and moving toward
the door) â Good-by.
ULFHEIM.
(Jumping up)â Good-by? What do you
mean?
MAIA.
Only that my instinct tells me I'd ba
happier to leave you; so â I'm going.
ULFHEIM.
(With an oath)-Not by a long chalk!
MAIA.
Why not? I am an individual; I have a
right to do as I please.
ULFHEIM.
Not where I'm concerned. You're a
good cook and you're pretty. Maia, and
you're a jolly companion. I say you shan't
SO.
MAIA.
Will you marry me if I stay? j
ULFHEIM.
(Reluctantly)â Yes.
MAIA.
But I won't marry you and I won't stay.
Three months of you is enough, but a life
timeâHeavens! I'd rather die.
ULFHEIM.
(Angrily, advancing toward her)â Then
you shall die!
MAIA.
(Firmly facing him)â I'm not afraid of
you, Ulfheim. You may kill me if you
please, but you cannot make me continue
to live a life without self-respect. No truo
woman can do that, and I'm going to bo
a true woman after this, or nothing.
ULFHEIM.
(Furiously)â You shall be nothing! (He
raises his arm and rushes in to strike her.
As he does so his doss fly at him and pin
him to the ground. In the confusion Maia
escapes. After a desperate struggle Ulf
heim succeeds in freeing himself from the
dogs, only to hear the voice of Maia sing
ing in the far distance:
I am free! I am free!
No more life with Ulfheim for me.
No more life in the prison for me!
The author of this mediated tragedy
confesses himself unable to imagine how
the scene with the do^s could be put upon
the stage, but he feels that no apology is
due the audience from him. since things
more wonderful and more improbable hap
pen in the Ibsen plays. Witness the gen
tleman who goes duek-huntlng inside hi3
house ("The Wild Duck"); the merchant
who sends eighteen men to certain death
in a rotten ship in order to prserve his
social reputation ("Pillars of Society"),
and the numerous incidents turning upon
hereditary diseases, the obscure Iaw3 of
which Ibsen expounds with a confidence*
that would put to shame a Galton or a
Haeckel.
The fund for the Actors' Home In N>w
York has now reached the respectable sum
of $58 913 29. Recent contributions include
one of $1000 from Jessie Bartlett Davia ami
another of $1297 32 from members (chiefly
non-professional) of the Actors' Club. New
York Contributions may be sent to the
busineÂ°s office of the New York Herald or
of the New York Dramatic Mirror. The
greater part of the money contributed haa
come from members of the profession. It
would be a graceful thing if the general
public were to do something liberal for
this excellent charity. Actors -when called
upon to play for charity seldom fail to re
spond generously. Witness the recent
Sweeney benefit. Let ua show them that
their generosity is appreciated.
That's all very well for you; but it
doesn't suit me. Where do I come in on
this arrangement? I'm sick of hunting
and of cooking for you, and I don't drink.
ULFHEIM.
You come in whenever I please. You
took me with your eyes open, and I didn't
make any bargain to keep you air.used.
Yes, but you might do something to
make my life a little more cheerful. It's
awfully stupid here, with only you and the
dogs.
ULFHEIM.
Why don't you go down and call on some
of the other women at the hotel?
(Savagely)â I didâ and what do you
think?
ULFHEIM.
What?
MAIA.
They never returned my calls.
ULFHEIM.
Why not?
MAIA.
ULFHEIM.
That woman that used to live in the
Doll's House?
I couldn't find out until my old friend
Nora came last week.
Yes, Nora; after following Mr. Anstey's
advice and taking a course in morality
at the Norwegian theaters, she settled
down and married a widower with six
children; quite respectable, you know.
ULFHEIM.
Well, what did she tell you?
MAIA.
(Excitedly)â She said that the reason
the other women didn't . return my calls
was because â because â (very excitedly)
you'll hardly believe it when I tell you.
ULFHEIM.
Out with It.
MAIA.
Because I wasn't married to you. There!
(Beginning to break down)â I don't
know and I don't care.
ULFHEIM.
ULFHEIM.
Silly old fools! Have they read Ibsen?
MAIA.
Send 'em down Shaw's book; perhaps
you can convert 'em.
MAIA.
Iâ I don't want to convert them. (Tear
fully)âI'm beginning to think they're not
altogether wrong.
ULFHEIM.
(Jumping up and kicking a dog Into each
corner of the room. The reader will please
remember that a stageroom has only two
corners; that's why we have two dogs,
not four)â What! You mean to say that
you believe that society has any rights
the individual is bound to respect?
(More firmly)â I don't pretend to de
cide for men, but for women I should say
yes.
ULFHEIM.
(Contemptuously)â You're a sweet kind
of an Advanced Woman, you are; you've
no more capacity for imbibing thÂ« true
Ibsen philosophy than a kitten has for
swimming. (Refilling his pipe)â It takes
a man like me to practice as well as to
preach the Gospel of Instinctive Individ
ualism.
(Earnestly)â Do you really believe that?
That each person has a right to do as he

The Bryanites insist that Minnesota, Michigan and

PERSONAL MENTION.
DANGEROUS DUTY NOBLY DONE.
OUR Government has no Victoria Cross, carry
ing with it honor and distinction, to confer
upon those who in its service perform deeds
of conspicuous heroism in war. Consequently when
a noble deed is nobly done under circumstances of
extreme danger, there can be no suspicion that the
hero was in any way animated by a desire to achieve
the coveted distinction. His act, like that of the
brave fireman, Sweeney, in this city, stands forth as
an exhibition of the heroic performance of duty solely,
and is therefore free from even a suspicion that would
dim its luster.
It is to the glory of our army that its officers and
its men have needed no medals nor special honors
to rouse them to heroic deeds, and yet when such
deeds are done there should be something of a loyal
recognition of them. The feat of Lieutenant Conrad
in carrying Lieutenant Butler from under the fire of
the Chinese in the attack on Tientsin is a case in
point. The Ninth Regiment advanced across an
open plain swept by a flanking fire to attack the en
trenched foe. In the attack Butler was wounded.
Conrad carried him from the, field, and, although he
was himself twice wounded in doing so, swam a ditch
still carrying his friend. We are told in the dispatches
that one of Conrad's wounds was so severe that his
arm had to be amputated.
A deed of that kind is genuine heroism of the high
est and purest type. It is the sort of achievement
that inspires men to valor and to fidelity. It even
adds a luster to the nation itself, for a country that
has such men as that in her armies will never fail
of respect and admiration. We need no cross of
honor to incite our soldiers to noble actions, but it
is clear we do need some fitting way to manifest the
national recognition of their valor.
THE DECAY OF OUR SHIPPING.
How do the Democrats propose to secure this for
our own people? Yowling about the Republican
policy will not answer the question. It is simply an
evasion. If it be desirable that our own people en
joy these profits and benefits, what is the Democratic
plan?
The object to be attained is the restoration of
American shipping and ship-building, in order to
keep at home about $100,000,000 a year paid to for
eign ship-owners for freight on our products trans
ported abroad for sale. In ten years this amounts
to a billion of dollars. We contribute that much
every decade to pay wages to foreign labor in ship
building and profits to foreign ship-owners, sailor3,
underwriters and all the widespread interests im
pinged upon the ocean. trade.
If the reasonable bounty system to employ labor in
rebuilding our merchant marine is wrong, let the
Democrats show that it is, and plainly tell the coun
try what they will substitute for it to secure the same
result
- I 'HE Democratic party has never missed an
I opportunity to charge upon the Republicans
*Â¦ the decay of our merchant marine. It has
dwelt at length and with noise and effusion upon the
losses that we suffer by emploj'inent of foreign bot
toms i'.i the transportation of our vast ocean com
merce. But that party has had two administrations
since the decline of our shipping began, with Con
gresses in agreement with it, and has done nothing
to remedy the difficulty of which it complains. The
Republican party believes in American bottoms for
American trade and proposes to secure them by a
reasonable bounty system, the fruits of which will
go mainly into the wages ' of labor. This is bit
terly antagonized, of course,, by the Democrats. But
do they want American cargoes under the American
flag? If they do,, how do they propose to go about
it? This is a campaign of affirmation's, not negations.
The people are not so much interested in viewing
with alarm or pointing with pride as they arc in what
affirmative policy parties will follow when in power.
Bryan forced the 16 to- 1 plank on the Democratic
party, but there is a big difference between the. party
and the county.
.. Bad as the election of Dibble to the Assembly
would be. that of Wclfe to the Senate would be even
vror5e, for he would hold over to tlie next Legislature
and thus be able to support a railroad candidate for
the United States Senate as well as to support the
railroad apportionment scheme. In short, the de
feat of both men is desirable in the interests of .hon
est politic?, and we repeat it is gratifying to know
that the loyal Republicans of their districts have re
$olvcd to effect it.
Under any circumstances the nomination of such
men by the Republicans would seriously compromise
the party. It would be a plain notice that in their dis
tricts at least the ward bosses, the Mint saloon gangs
end the railroad were in control. This year such
nominations would be particularly unfortunate, be
cause the coming Legislature is to apportion the As
sembly, the Senatorial and the Congressional districts
of the Stale, and under that apportionment all elec
tions will be held for the next ten years. The railroad
and the Mint saloon bosses of each party are in com
bination for the purpose of controlling the Legisla
ture and making the apportionment. Can any man
doubt in whose service Dibble and Wolfe would work
were they in the Legislature when that issue
COir ' CSl:i)? â¢ r ,.-,,.,.
The apportionment of the various electoral dis
tricts is a matter of serious concern to the people.
Should the control of the Legislature be in their hands
the railroad managers 3.nd the Mint saloon bosses
would so gerrymander the State as to give themselves
an immense advantage in every election for legislators
and for Congressmen for a decade to come. To
achieve that the railroad politicians have for some
time past been engaged in doing politics with Crim
mins and Kelly and the Democratic bosses of this
city. Their schemes car. be defeated only by the reso
lute action of loyal Republicans in fighting every
candidate -that the railroad and the Mint saloon ma
chine f.v.t t:p. That is the responsibility the emer
gency imposes upon the Republican party and upon
independent voters.
Of Mr. 'Wolfe it may be said that in the Legislature
his actions have not belied his name. When anything
in the shape of spoils was to be hunted down, no rav
enous wolf of the plain? ever followed a trail with a
more tireless energy or with a greater intensity of
greed. He stands for nothing that is Republican. It
may be doubted if he is even aware of the nature of
Republican policies. Certainly he has no high respect
for- the reputation of the party and would not hesi
tate a moment in betraying it if he saw any profit
for himself in doing so.
It may be necessary later on to review the politi
cal record of Dibble :>nd of Wolfe, but it does not ap
pear so at this time. The people know very well
what sort cf politics crch of the two practices. Judge
Dibble has been so consistently and persistently a
supporter of the Southern Pacific Company, and has
so earnestly advocated all of its schemes in the Legis
lature, that he is universally regarded as an employe
of the company â the representative of the corporation
en the noor of the Assembly, just as other well-known
characters are recognized as the representatives of the
company in the lobby.
GRATIFYING to every loyal Republican and to
every friend uf honest politics and the wel
fare of the State is the announcement of a
movement among the Republicans of their districts to
defeat the ambition of Judge Dibble to obtain election
to the Assembly and of Eddie Wolfe to be elected to
the Senate. Neither of these men is in any way
representative of the people, of the Republican party
or of any legitimate interest of the community. So
far as they represent anything- at all outside of their
Selfish fortunes it is the Southern Pacific Company,
but in the main they are in politics for the spoils and
for boodle.
FOR HONEST POLITICS.
Devotees to the fashion of wearing high collars will
perhap? be. pleased to learn that a New York doctor
says such collars have a 'tendency to cause tonsiliti*.
and that the "disease :s'n6w regarded as fashionable.
To prevent the railroad and the saloon bosses from
controlling""the Legislature and. so Retting power to
apportion the electoral' districts of the State for the
next ten years, every Republican must do his duty.
This is no time' to take chances.
SCKNEâ A room in Ulfheim's hut In
the mountains. Left, up stage, a
bear skin couch. Right, ditto, an
open fireplace. On left wall, down
stage, a rude wooden shelf, middle of
which Is ornamented with a bust of Ibsen;
on left end of shelf a human skull, which
is instantly recognized (by all of the au
dience who have read "When We Dead
Awaken") as that of Arnold Rubek. On
right end of shelf a little book. The near
est seat in the orchestra-;- Is thirty feet
from this book, but every one in the house
perceives at once that the title on I this
book reads "The Quintessence of Ibsen
ism: By G. Bernard Shaw." Ulfheim is
discovered devouring bear steaks, the
bones of which he throws to his two
dogs, who eat them with less voracity
than does their master the steaks. The
room is filled with smoke arising from the
bear steak, which Mala is with difficulty
cooking as fast as Ulfheim can eat.
MAIA.
(Throwing down the frylngpan) â There,
Ulfheim, I declare I'll not fry you an
other steak to-night.
ULFHEIM.
(Stretching himself contentedly and fill
ing his pipe)â Well, I've had about
enough, little woman. Won't you have a
bit? I don't want any more.
MAIA.
(Pettishly)â Thank you; you are really
too kind. But I'm too tired to eat.
ULFHEIM.
Tired? I don't see what's made you tired.
MAIA.
Your society.
ULFHEIM.
Oh, come, now.
MAIA.
Yes, your society in this (glancing
around) prison.
ULFHEIM.
You seem to get yourself Into prison
everywhere you go. When you left Rubek
you sane something about "No More Life
in His Prison for You."
MAIA.
(Taking up the skull almost tenderly)â
Ah, poor Rubek; he wasn't a bad fellow
after all. And with all his faults he had
the advantage of being my husband.
ULFHEIM.
(Snatching the skull from her and
throwing it across the room)â What stuff!
The very thing you wanted to get rid ofâ
and the snowslide saved me the trouble
of doing It for you.
MAIA.
(Thoughtfully)â Yes, but I sometimes
think I made a mistakeâ several mistakes.
ULFHEIM.
For instance?
MAIA.
1 Well, mistake number one was you.
You're not such a pleasant person to live
with as I imagined, Ulfheim.
ULFHEIM.
Well, thank God, I'm not an artist, at
any rate; I'm a Primitive Man. You said
you wanted to be free and live with a
Primitive Man.
MAIA.
Yes but you're too primitive for any
body but a Hottentot, Ulfheim. You do
nothing but hunt all day and get drunk
every night.
ULFHEIM.
"Well, what would you have? I'm only
following my instinct, and our friend Ib
sen there (pointa with his pipe to the bust)
tells you that's the highest morality.

AMUSEMENTS.
SUNDAY JULY 22, 1900
MUCH 0DO flBOUT NOTHING-
Z^ ASTERN people take a keen interest in Cali
Â¦'- fornia and particularly in its Chinese
* â * problems. As the interest is not always ac
companied by a knowledge of the facts of the situa
tion, there grows out of it no- end of misconceptions,
misrepresentations and foolish alarms. We had illus
trations of such errors in the exaggerated reports
given of the bubonic plague quarantine a short time
ago, and now we have more of the same kind in the
expression of Eastern fears that the people of San
Francisco will burst out in mob violence and inflict
upon the Chinese of this city retaliation for the out
rages committed by Boxers upon Americans in China.
The matter has been brought directly to our at
tention by a correspondent living in Pittsburg, Pa.
He sends us an editorial from the Pittsburg De
spatch commenting upon the supposed danger to ths
Chinese; in this city, and saying: "To undertake to
revenge by mob violence the outrages in China on
Chinamen in this country who had no participation in
them would be to show that we have in the United
States an element as bad as the Chinese without the
mitigation of ignorance. If there is any tendency in
that direction it will devolve on both the local and
general govcrnnients to prove they have more virility
in compelling order than the Chinese 'Government
has. So far frankness must admit the disagreeable
fact that our Government makes a poor showing in
this respect, for while both China and the United
States have paid indemnity for mob outrages China
has sometimes punished the rioters and the United
States never has."
To that editorial our correspondent adds a per
sonal appeal to The Call to use its columns and to
"induce other Western newspapers to do all in their
power to suppress even the appearance of a desire or
intent to revenge the massacres of our American
missionaries by massacreing innocent Chinamen in
our land." His plea is written with full earnestness,
and he adds: "If the columns of our public 'press
toem with appeals to the pride and manhood of our
citizens, whether native or foreign born, asking them
to demonstrate under these most aggravating cir
cumstances and appeals for vengeance that our Chris
tian civilization is so much superior to the heathen
barbarism that has characterized the murder and
massacre of our Christian missionaries, the present
serious and intensely aggravating scenes afford the
American people an instance such as the world's his
tory has never had of demonstrating to the entire
world the superiority of our Christian civilization."
All of that is most excellent in sentiment and in
tent, but it is nevertheless the expression of an alarm
absolutely uncalled for. In San Francisco there is
not the slightest danger of an attack on Chinatown
or on the Chinese residing in other parts of the
city. So far from doing mob violence to any of the
race, it is becoming doubtful whether we shall even
succeed in getting the Board of Health and the
police to enforce the sanitary laws within the district
where most of them dwell.
Race animosities against the Chinese do not exist
among Californians to anything like the extent our
Eastern friends imagine. There is an opposition to
the immigration of Chinese t,o the country, but that
ij based upon reason and not prejudice. There has
never been a suggestion in. the press or on the streets
of this city of anything like an attack upon the race
by way of revenge for what has been done by the
Boxers. On that score the Eastern people may tie
content. Nothing will be done in San Francisco jof
a retaliatory kind, nor is there even a desire on the
part of anybody to attempt it. ff
flN INSIDIOUS SCHEME.
THE Bryan platform is rich in denunciation of
government by injunction, and by reaffirming
the Chicago* platform projects into this cam
| paign its destructive attack on the courts. If one will
| itflect upon the incidents of the State convention at
i Sacramento there will appear the deliberate and
I planned purpose to remove from, property its judi
; cial protection. Hon. Dan Ostrom sought to be made
' a delegate at large. His long public experience and
i capacity for leading men by convincing their reason
! would have made him a strong man on the delega-
I tion. Me has always made his living by farming, is
; a large owner of real property, all earned- by hard
I -.York, and has a good citizen's respect for law ar.d
; order. He lives under government by injunction.
! Like other farmers in the Sacramento Valley, he
! holds possession of his land against destruction by
I hydraulic mining by virtue of Judge Sawyer's in
! junction. The Populist control of Democracy did
not want such a man on the delegation. Nor did that
control that is behind Populism want him. It is an
old and wholesome principle of the common law that
while a man may enjoy his own, his use stops when
it becomes a damage to another. Behind all of these
attacks upon law and order is a sinister influence
which chafes under that principle, and It uses Popu
lism, anarchy, socialism, nihilism and every other
form of attack upon the rights of property to carry
out its purpose.
We have already explained the processes of direct
legislation. Under this system, demanded in the
Kansas City platform, courts, Congresses and Legis
latures disappear, or remain shorn of their constitu
tional power and dwarfed into inutility. Every issue
now settled by judicial decision will be unsettled.
Ever}- perpetual, injunction now written in the de
crees of the courts will go to popular vote, and the
rights of property and the regulation of its uses will
be taken from the courts and put into politics, to be
settled at the polls and made the material for dema
gogues to work on. -
The proposition is the most dangerous and in
sidious that has ever been made. Not the least of its
dangers is in its flattery of the people. It whispers
to them certain truths, which are fundamental under
our system of government â that they are the source
of power, therefore why not exercise it directly, with
out the mediation of, representatives? Those who
oppose this are taunted with being afraid of the peo
ple, unwilling to trust them, and desirous of taking
power away from the masses. In the very nature of
these appeals one can feel the rising of the deluge
that will be if once the floodgates are raised.
Our constitution was made to secure and per
petuate free, representative self-government. What
ever invades that system of government smites the
constitution. Whatever destroys it destroys the con
stitution.
The people in their economic life practice represen
tation. The farmer does not shoe his own horse, but
is represented in that operation by the blacksmith.
The blacksmith does not raise his own wheat, but is
represented by the farmer. Each shows his capacity
to govern his own affairs by the correctness of his
judgment in selecting his representative in these
economic operations. The men who made the con
stitution simply carried this universal economic prin
ciple into government. Citizens who have not the
time to study the relation of a public policy or legal
principle to their interests select a representative
who by reason of his representative character is
moved to give the time required to master the ques
tions that inhere in government. No one will pre
tend that the economic system of the country would
prosper if demagogues should go out teaching the
people that one man can shoe horses, raise wheat,
weave cloth or paint pictures just as well as another,
and therefore needs ho representative in any of theÂ«e
activities lying outside his own vocation. Nor will
any one, not partisan mad, pretend that all juridicable
matters and all the legislation and administration of
government can be carried on at the ballot-box and
made a part of the politics of the country.
Liberty regulated by law was established by the
constitution. License regulated by the potent pas
sions which attend party action is to be substituted.
We ask men who know why they belonged to the
old Democratic party if they can think of supporting
this proposition for the abolition of the guarantees of
government and property?

?
The rec^r.t rise ln the price of sliver has
caused a preat deal of comment ar.d also
rr.uchÂ»conjÂ«:cture concerning future quo
tations. The rise Is probably due to an
active demand for the metal. If this
opinion Is correct the appreciation In price
Is of Importance to many silver properties
In the Pacific coast States. There has
r re zi pome speculative interest in the mar-
Icet. but this has not been enough to ex
ercise any marked influence upon quota
tlor.5. Many Eastern journals have dis
cussed the matter. A comprehensive re
view of existing conditions is contained
in the Krigineering and Mining Journal,
published in New York, which takes the
view that the Increase Is due to the in
dustrial demand and, in greater degree.
to the demand for the metal ln the Orient.
The Journal mentioned reaches this high
ly satisfactory conclusion for those who
have silver mine holdings: "I'pon the
whole it appears probable that the de
mand for silver will be large for some
time to come, and that the metal will
command high pricesâ that is. in compari
son with those which have been the rule
for several years past."
The reasoning of the same authority Is
Interesting, being In paxt as follows:
There has been, as Â»e noted some time ago,
an Increase in the demand for silver for indus
trial purposes. This is the result, in ;>art. of
the low prices which have prevailed for several
years, but ln ereater decree of the general
proEf*rity of the past two or three years. Bus
ln<**s has b^en good, the ftvorld has been busy
ar.d has had a surplus to spend, so that there
has been a demand for the articles of use
ai;4 ornament la which silver forms an Im
portant part.
This Industrial demand, however, though of
importance, is not of itself enough to cause a
rise in prices. This Is mainly due to the de
mand for the metal in the Kast. especially ln
India and China.
The quantity Of sliver taken for export to
Ir.dla In the first half of the year showed an
increase of 23 per cent, which was mainly due
to the purchases of the metal which were forced
on the Indian <Joveron>ent. When the coinage
of silver Has discontinued ln India seven years
aj?o the reserve which the Government main
tained asair.st Its circulating notes was largely
in silver rupees. As thla reserve was drawn
upon It was replaced by gold under the policy
adopted r.y the Government. India is a poor
country, however, and the great bulk of the
business transactions among its peÂ°P' e '* ' n
amount.* too small for any gold coin that might
be issiK-d. and i?old coin does not circulate at
all ln the cour.try. Even the hoards of the
people are usually too Fmall for gold, and by
necessity as well as by custom they are in
silver. The demand for coined rupees continued
steadily and tbe reserve ln the' Indian Treas
ury vsf drawn down so low that theCovera-
Best became alarmed at its small amount.
of sliver continue It may be inferred that a
llrr.lt has not been reached.
Besides this Government demand the private
purchases of silver for India have continued
as large as usual. It has been noted .hereto
fore that in famine years sales of silver to

The number of poada of sand washed
and the weight of gold recovered must be
entered in official books obtained from a
Government mining office. The gold re
covered must be kept on hand at the mine
and its weight must agree exactly with
the total recorded. If any gold has been
Eent to the Mining Bureau the receipt may
be shown ln lieu of the gold. No one Is
allowed to sell gold or to use It in trade.
All gold from the mines must be deposit
ed with the Government Mining Bureau,
where it is weighed, melted and assayed
just as it is ln the United States with the
difference that the Russian Government
desires the presence of the mine owner
or his representative during the melting.
The gold is paid for at the rate of 9044
per cent of the coinage value of the metal.
This Is the direct tax upon the produc
tion. There is also a tax upon the land,
which is fixed at the time of tho approval
of the official survev. When part of a
claim Is upon village community lands
the village authorities demand an annual
tax. Whenever the workings destroy a
grain field or a pasture proper . recom
pense must be made.
i What would be called in the United
States an entry Is called ln Russia a
"zalafky." Such papers are for veins or
for placers. One person may enter a vein
claim adjoining his own entry for placer
but he cannot have the beginning points
of two veins or two placers closer to each
other than five versts (about 3 1-3 miles)
though adjoining claims may be acquired
by purchase. It is the custom for the
wife and relatives of a mine owner to
take out mining rights, and thus the law
against entering adjoining claims is prac
1 tically inoperative.
The filing of the zarafky gives the right
to explore the ground by shafts or other-
Wise, but not to take away any gold. The
law provides that all the gold that Is
found during exploration must be thrown
back into the shafts, but this probably
Is never observed. Before beginning the
work of taking out gold the head mining
engineer of the district must be notified
and an undertaking for liability for injury
to or death of any employe must be
signed. One foreman was Imprisoned two
months because a miner was kiljed In a
poorly timbered drift to which he had
been sent to work.
Charles Tappan has made a translation
of the Russian mining law. Any one can
own mines who has secured a miner's
right. The preliminaries, for a foreigner,
are quite complicated and Include a cer
tificate from the law courts of one's
native country that he Is not insolvent
and the Russian consul nearest the place
of residence must certify that this cer
tificate Is ln proper form. The limit of a
filacer claim is 280 acres and the greatest
ength cannot exceed three and one-third
miles. A vein claim cannot exceed one
square verst. The official land surveyor
is paid by the Government, "but." says
Mr. Tappan, "It Is customary to give him
40 or 50 rubles, 'for tea,' and also 10 to
15 rubles to the army officer, who Is
always detailed to watch that the land
surveyor is not bribed."
I For China the demand has been on a <1<ff<>
| ent basis. The shipments to that country for
j thÂ° first half year have been nearly double
Â¦ those of last year. This has not been duo to
J any great Increase in tra/ie. but to the fact
! that European nation* â especially Russiaâ hav.
i tv>en spending large amounts In China for rall
i road building, mine explorations, Improvements
| of port* and other \rorks. and their payments
1 have been largely made in silver. The demand
I thus created had to be met by purchases In
the opsn market, end these have been a factor
quite as important as the Indian buying in
maintaining prices. The demand for China
Is likely to continue and may be increased
rather than diminished by the present state
of affaJra there.
India do not fall off, as might be expected,
and this has been the case during the present
fear.
so ,]"t of thing. Superintendent Webster
will probably make a fight on the propo
sition, and there will be a merry time.

SCHOOLS SOUTH
OF MARKET MAY
BE ABOLISHED
Board of School Directors to
Consider the Matter
To-Morrow.
Superintendent Webster Will Prob
ably Make a Hard Fight Over the
Proposed Eight-Year
Course of Study.
There is a possibility that the School
Board, when it meets on next Monday,
may abolish the Longfellow School, and
possibly the Stanford as well. The board
will at least abolish one school south of
Market street, and Director Denman Is
anxious to cut out two schools. A fight is
expected over the proposition.
Members of the board admit that they
are contemplating the "consolidation" of
schools south of Market street, as they
are pleased to term it. but they do not
like to hear the term "abolish." The re
stilt will be the same, at all events. The"
children who have been attending the
abolished school will have to find places
In some of the other schools, possiblv
some distance away, and the result will
mean trouble for the Directors.
The Directors will not admit that they
are contemplating the abolishment of
Longfellow School, but it is a fair sur
m!sc from the turn that affairs have
taken that they have such a course ln
contemplation. The board has many re
forms to make and salaries to pay and a
reduction of expenses must be made in
some direction to meet all of the require
ments. Other members of the board do
not agree with Director Denman concern-
Ing the Stanford Sch'ool. and It is not be
lieved that that proposition will go
through.
Another matter of great importance
that will come before the board to-mor
row will be the consideration- of the new
course of study. Superintendent of
Schools "Webster has been working for
vears to perfect a nine years'. course, but
the present board has disregarded his
suggestions and desires an eight-year
course, with fancy cooking and all that I
Shaughnessey Again Accused.
; John Shaughnessey. who. with George
"West. Is locked up In the City Prison with
charges of grand larceny and vagrancy
against his name, will ln aJl probability
have to answer to another charge. He is
accused of "lifting" a diamond pin. from
the necktie of Julius Reuner, -who waa
visiting the Olympla Theater. The crime
was committed a few nights ago. Reuner
was leaving the theater when Shaugh
nessey and another man. supposed to be
West, touched him for his pin. Last night
Reuner visited the City Prison and posi
tively identified Shaughnessey as being one
of the men who sot away with his pin.
KWANG SU, THE CHINESE EMPEROR.
The merchants of Chinatown ln San
Francisco and most of the other Chinese
people there celebrated yesterday as the
THE sun do move." say the subjects
of Kwang Su, and the movements
. of the orb of day puzzle them when
they try to celebrate their Emper
or's birthday.
Ho Yow, Consul General, was not satis
fled with the way Chinatown was
conducting itself regarding the Em
peror's birthday, and yesterday he
set about reforming the Chinese
calendar to make it fit both sides
of the one hundred and eightieth
meridian. That was hard work even
for an astronomer, and harder still
for him. More than, that it was
absolutely Impossible for him to make
his compatriots see it that way. So he
cabled to Hongkong asking an immediate
answer as to what day it was there. The
answer came oack that it was "yester
day"âthat Is according to the day of the
month it was here. The rest of the Chi
nese said: "Well, that does not demon
strate anything except that the telegraph
is slow. We always thought It was bv
the way the messages get around. Jus"t
like the messenger boys."
Now th* result is this: To-day is the
26th day of the sixth moon of the twenty,
sixth year of the reign of Kwang Su â
that is It Is In San Francisco. It is only
yesterday In China.
\\ ons Chung, the secretary of the Six
Companies, said that his people also
would not observe the occasion but In the
most perfunctory manner.
In some of the restaurants and more
particularly in the back rooms of the
stores of some of the smaller tradesmen,
there was high carnival yesterday, and
plenty of sam shu and broken china.
Ho Yow i3 right. A celebration of the
birthday anniversary of any Chinese
potentate these days might be an entire
waste of energy and money, as there is no
telling what heads have now no necks
under them.
"Beside that we feel that we owe it to
the memory of those who have suffered
in China to abstain from all of the festivi
ties and Joyous proceedings with which
we usually mark the occasions. We will
have a few flowers and will meet and
draw up memorials to be forwarded to his
majesty. Beyond that nothing will be
done."
Emperor's birthday and a great number
of varnished roast piss were carried away
from the hooks in front of the pork shops.
"The people of the legation, most of the
officials of the Six Companies and the
literati generally will not celebrate until
to-morrow," said Ho Yow. in explaining
the matter to a Call reporter yesterday
evening. "Our celebration this year will
be very, very quiet, for two reasons; one
is the uncertainty of the fate of the Em
peror. We do not know officially that he
is dead: that is all I can say as to whethei
or not he lives.

tainly succeeded In reaping a rich har
vest, and more to come when the return
trip comes. A great many of the people
who came hero are practically broke, and
will have to be taken out by the Govern
ment before winter sets in, and I think
that steps should be taken right away to
inform the authorities at Washington of
the true state of affairs, In order that the
people here may have a chance to get
out before the Ice closes In. Among the
gold seekers who came in here are a large
number of women and children, and the
women are almost to a unit terribly dis
gusted with the place and Its prospects.
/The women look funny enough with
their short dresses and rubber boots. They
all look short and dumpy, as if they were
sawed off and hammered down, especially
those of considerable avoirdupois. The
main street of the town Is covered with
sand and is as dirty, dusty and disagree
able as It possibly can be, and is so nar
row that when the teams are hauling It
is almost impossible to pass along. The
sidewalks are from three to five feet In
width and are built on any old grade to
suit the whim of the owner. You strike
one place right on the ground, and the
next about two or three feet high, so it is
not very pleasant traveling. But they are
always Jammed with people going in and
out of the saloons, so you have to taks
the street If you wish to make any pro
gress. You can't walk along the beach on
account of the vast amount of freight
which is piled up and which Is constantly
being added to by the arrival of the sail
ing- fleets.
Large fleets of sailing vessels are arriv
ing daily with lumber, and the price has
dropped from $250 per thousand (when we
landed) to $70 and $S0 per thousand, aiid
there is lots, of it. It will probably De
cheaper In a short while.

"Was Washed Up on the Beach Near
Point Eeyes Lighthouse.
SAX RAFAEL. July 21.â The real thing
in the pea serpent line was found on the
beach near Point Reyes lighthouse this
morning. An employee while patroling
the beach came across It high on the sand
Â¦where It was stranded after being washed
The animal was 7 feet long and 20 inches
In circumference in the thickest part of
the body. It had two large horns which
protruded from the large head, large
teeth and massive jaws. It was alive
when found. It was killed with stones
er.d taken to the lighthouse and will be
, preserved. '
SCENE ON THE NOME BEACH ON JULY 1.
My advice to air Californians who are
at all inflicted with the Nome fever is tm
stay at home, and they will all be much
better off. It looks to me as If the whole
scheme of advertising the beach diggings
so extensively was worked up by the
Advice to Californians.
Prospectors are now scattering out In all
directions, the land having thawed out.
and reports of rich finds are being looked
for every day. Of course all the country
is staked, restaked, jumped and relocated
again, and it makes things bad, but if rich
strikes are made a large number of men
will be able to obtain work. 1 went up
Dry Creek last week for a distance of five
miles, and the stakes on the corner of
each claim looked like a row of ninepins.
On one claim I counted ten different
names. No assessment work has been
done, and as they have until January next
In which to do It, nothing can be done
with them until that time in the way of
relocating. Every claim is for sale, or
they want you to prospect It for half.
Some people here hold an interest in as
high as one hundred claims. But I think
that when this false boom Is over and
about half the people now here have re
turned home things will regulate them
selves and that probably In the next two
or three years this place will be all right.
I would certainly not advise anybody to
come here to get wcrk or engage In busl
ress of any kind, as it Is all badly over
done at present.
Some development work is being done
on the tundra claims, but so far nothing
has been found to pay. There are thou
sands <9t acres of this tundra, stretching
from the Sering Sea to the mountains,
and If it should turn out that there is gold
in paying quantities In it this camp will
bo the greatest mining camp in the world.
Of course it is going to be expensive to
work, and only rich companies can handle
the proposition, but If they do strike it
there would not be enough men here to do
the work.
Tundra May Turn Oat Rich.
every position to be filled, and as that iÂ»
about all the work that is being done in
town, you can Imagine the condition of
things. When we first arrived at Nome
the population did not exceed 4000 at the
outside. It now .has a population of
at least 22,000, and things, of course,
are naturally in a very unsettled state.
People are leaving on every steamer
nearly as fast as others are
taking their places, so the population
stays about the same. Smallpox was
brought in by the steamer Oregon, and
there are now eleven cases reported to the
officials, who have established a pest
house on the sandsplt between the Snake
River and Bering Sea. So far there has
only been one death, but a great many
people are getting away from here as fast
as they can on account of the dangerous
and loathsome disease. Typhoid fever
Is also rampant, there being about thirty
five cases. There is also reported to.be
about two hundred cases of pneumonia.
As there is no sewer system or sanitary
regulations of any kind, 1 think that this
camp will be a terrible place this summer.
The city Is now under military law,
and the officers are doing all they can
for the welfare and health of the people,
but under existing conditions cannot ac
complish much good.
So far as the beach is concerned I should
call It a flat failure. There is no doubt
in the world but that a large amount of
gold was taken from there last fall and
during the early spring, but there Is no
more to be had in paying quantities. The
beach has been thoroughly prospected
for a distance of fifty miles each side of
Nome, and with the exception of a small
strip near a place called Topkuk no pay
has been found. At the latter place three
men took out $36,000 in about three weeks,
but the spot was small and soon played
out. Of course there was a stampede
there and people are still going down,
only to return wiser but sadder men. Hun
dreds of thousands of dollars' worth of
engines and pumps are still on the beach,
where they have been unloaded, and have
not yet been set up. And it is the very
best machinery that could be purchased.
So much for the much-heralded rich
beach diggings at Nome.
There are at least 10,000 Idle men here
at present, and of course the air Is full
of "hard luck" stories. Plenty of build-
Ing, hauling and longshorlng Is going on,
but there are at least twenty men for
Little Gold on the Beach.
Now, as far as the diggings on the beach
are concerned there is nothing In it ex
cept to those who are working sluicing
outfits, as they work the entire beach
down to bedrock, good, bad and Indiffer
ent, tailings and all. But a great many' of
these are not making enough to pay the
men their wages ($6 per day and board)
and are being shut down one after the
other. The plants In operation extend
from, the Nome River on the east to the
Penny River on the west, a distance of
twelve miles, and are all the way from
a hundred yards to half a mile apart
and embrace every kind of a machine
known.

|\ I here five weeks and have probably
I V a different idea of the future pros-
I \ pects of Alaska than a vast major
Â¦*~ " ity of the people here. The main
reason that the people think this country
is no good Is because of their disappoint
ment In the beach diggings. Fully 50 per
cent of those coming here expected to go
to work on the beach immediately upon
their arrival and at least to make good
wages. Now the fact is that the beach
has been worked out. or nearly so. In
rare instances some man strikes a rich
spot and takes out about $20 to $25 per
day, but there are hundreds at work on
the beach who do not make more than
$2 50 to $3 per day, and as it, costs that
much to live here become quickly discour
aged and quit work, only to have their
places taken by "cheechakas" (newcom
ers), who come In on later boats. The
beach right in front of our tent has been
torn up at least five or elx times since
we have been here, each newcomer from
the different vessels digging over the same
spots and the tide leveling it off again a
short time after.
VANCOUVER, B. C. July 21.â There
was a serious fight at Stevenson, where
the Fraser River canneries are located,
during last night between special pollce
inen and striking fishermen. Two boats
were out fishing under the protection of
two patrol tugs with special police on
board. Eighty strikers followed In small
boats, attacked the patrol tugs and en
paged In a hand-to-hand fight with the
officers. No one was armed, or there
would have been several fatalities. The
police were vastly outnumbered by the
fishermen, who vlimbed aboard the tugs
and administered a severe beating to the
police. The white men who had been
Tishing under police protection were taken
ashore bv the strikers and paraded
through the streets with placards at
tached to their backs denouncing them as
ecabs.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. CAMP
O'RYAN. 8ANTA CRUZ. July 21.â The
cadets fittingly celebrated their last night
In Â¦ camp this evening. The company
streets were illuminated with gay-colored
lanterns, flags and bunting and presented
a pretty appearance. Hed flre and fire
works were used to add to the general
effect. Each company presented an en
tertainment which was greatly enjoyed
by the many visitors who filled the camp.
At headquarters Colonel Power and his
staff entertained friends with an excellent
programme. Achllle Artigues played
some of his original compositions on the
piano; Sam Yale rendered rag-time selec
tions; Ed Moore sang some negro melo
dies; "Brick" Thompson recited; Major
Deasy sang some ballads; "Will Curley and
Joe Smith did some graceful cakewalk
ing; Steve Douglas played the violin; Ser
geant Parker sang, and other numbers
were rendered by the versatile members
of the regiment.
At the close of the entertainment
"rough house" was the order of the night.
The corporal of the guard and his assist
ants were kept busy chasing from one
end of the camp to the other to restore
quiet. Tents were lowered on sleeping oc
cupants, water was thrown on cadets who
sought' Plumber, their faces were black
ened, and everything that could be done
that would make the life of some one
miserable was tried with every degree of
success. Within an hour after taps the
guardhouse was so filled that the prison
ers were cramped for room. The fun was
fast and furious and will be remembered
for all times.
Members of Company H and the bugle
corps went on a bus ride to Capitola yes
terday. Comedians Quinn and Itellly went
along and furnished entertainment for the
pleasure seekers. When the crowd reach
ed Capitola the band was on the beach
rendering concert music The temptation
to have some fun with the musicians was
too great to be overlooked. Quinn and
Reilly bought a quantity of limes and dis
tributed them among the cadets. They
then filed over to the band stand and b*
gan sucking their lemons. This move had
a funnj- effect on the players. First the
cornet soloist became nervous. His lips
began to twitch as if he were partaking
of the lemon, and he gave up playing:
the slide trombone manipulator slowed up
materially in his work, and within a few
minutes the band, with the exception of
the snare and bass drum artist, gave up
playing. The effect of limes on them was
too great and the crowd was cheated out
of Its dally concert. -- " '-â¢

on the excellence of his command.
Major- Morrisey and Captain Sullivan,
the Burgeon and assistant surgeon of the
regiment, are glad to report that the camp
has been free from sickness. They have

they are duly thankful.

Supervisor Reed In discussing the matter
said: "We find Lake Tahoe to be a great

Southern Pacific Contempt Matter
Before Judge Bahrs Stayed by a
Writ of Prohibition."
The Supreme Court has Issued a writ
of prohibition to restrain Superior Judge
Bahrs from taking up the contempt of
court proceedings against ' the â¢ Southern
P&ciflc Railroad Company, and Its officers
â¢ to-morrow. A -week or so -ago Judge
Bafcrs, in. the case of the Railroad Com
missioners against the Southern Pacific,
rendered judgment prohibiting the rail
road pe<ipÂ£> from violating an order of the
Kailroad Commission. By this order the
transportation- company was forbidden
from maintaining passenger rates to
Fresno at $5 90. :
Some time afro the rate between these
points was reduced in order to quash
competition and the new rate was made
at $3 75. The law forbids railroad com
panies from increasing rates for passage
without the consent *of the State's of
ficials. When the Southern Pacific con
cluded to return to the old rate of J5 SW
it did not ask the permission or consent
of the Commissioners and In an action
brought by the commission Judge Bahrs
reached the conclusion already set forth â
that the Southern Pacific must. obey the
orders of the commission.
This had no effect, for the company
continued to charge the old rate of $5 W
and upon this fact betnsr brought to the
attention of the Superior Court H. E.
Huntlngton, T. H. Goodman and J. C.
Stubbs were cited for contempt of court
and the hearing of the matter was set for
to-morrow.
In the meantime the Southern Pacific
had perfected its appeal to the Supreme
Court from the judgment rendered by
Judge Bahrs and yesterday J. E. Koulds,
representing the railroad, In his peltion
for a writ of prohibition took the posi
tion that while an appeal from a judgment
is undecided by the nigher court the Judge
of the court from which the appeal Is
being taken has no power to hear con
tempt proceedings growing out of the
judgment appealed from. The granting
of the temporary writ will prevent the
case from being heard to-morrow, as thÂ«
case In the Supreme Court will not be
heard until August 6 at 2 p. m.

THE comlnjr revival of "Wycherley-
Garrick-Daly's comedy of "The
Country Girl" at the Alcazar
Theater has called forth an abso
lutely unique effort in the domain of press
agency, a distillation of pure joy. It Is
too good to pass by and is here given In
full:
The character of Peggy, cnÂ« of charming
recklessness of innocence, ls Just suited to
Florence Roberts' style of acting. Miss Rob
erts has made the character a deep study and
she will exemplify the charms of the new
school of natural acting accentuated by an in
tuitive knowledge of that abandon to the part
portrayed which seems to mark all that we
know or read of the old school. Her appear
ance In bey's clothes may- be taken as the
first exemplification of that strajige. delightful
thing that Shakespeare called "coddling." a
scmething wholly Indeterminate in our time.
The delicious wantonness of her limbs, which
are as lawless as boneless innocence can make

the chilly winds of the Presidio and trop

heavy clothing. The troops under orders
to China must go fully equipped with
clothing fit for either there or the Philip

DENTER, July 21. â The executive coun
cil of the American Federation of Labor
to-day issued an appeal to all wage work
ers to organize and federate. It says:
Throughout our country a struggle ls raging
between the oppressor and the oppressed, tha
possessors of wealth and the laborers; concen
tration of industry and wealth ls the order of
the day. Everywhere the workers must suffer
disastrous results unless they organize and fed
erate to protect and promote their mutual in
terests.
In this combination and concentration of
wealth the possessors permit no sectional or
State lines to interfere with their power, and it
therefore behooves the tollers, the wealth-pro
ducer*, to unite and federate regardless
whether they are located. East. West. North
or South. Irrespective of sex, politics, color or
relijTion. The hope of the workers, the prayer
of all our people for justice and rlpht and thÂ»
perpetuation of republican Institutions lies in
organized labor.
Recognizing these essential truths the exec
utive council of the American Federation of
Labor appeals to all wageworkers of whatever
trade or calling to organize unions where such
do not now exist, to Join those already organ
ized, to form unions and International unions
of their respective trades and callings and 10
affiliate In one common bond of labor upon the
broad platform and under the proud banner ol
the American Federation of Labor.
In calling upon the workers to unite and fed
erate we aim to do no one wrong but to estab
lish Justice for all.

MASTERLY INACTIVITY
IN THE NATIONAL GUARD
But Little Doing at This Time.
Chang-es Announced in the
Fifth Infantry.
There appears to be at this time in the
National Guard of California a degree of
what Is designated as "masterly Inactiv
ity." There is but very little doing, and
nothing in the line of placing the guard
on a footing to be ready for a call should
there be a demand in case of trouble in
the Orient.
The First Regiment of Infantry is in a
condition which shows that there is not
that interest in the ranks that there was
in that organization before the Spanish-
American war. The naval militia is not
as enthusiastic as it was, and it is re
portod that four of the prominent officers
of the contingent in this city are ready
to throw up their commissions. Reports
from the' south are not of a very encour
aging character, and taken altogether,
the guard is, as a prominent member said
yesterday, "in pretty bad shape."
Fourteen men have been discharged
from the service of the State from the
Fifth Infantryâ live at expiration of term
of service, six on account of removal and
three for the good of the service. - _
The following changes in the Fifth In
fantry are announced:
Sergeant Ray C. De Yoe. Company B. to be
battalion sergeant major; Private Charles Pay
son Riggs to be battalion sergeant major.
Company Bâ Sergeant Leonard M. Farrel to be
first sergeant: Corporals I>ouls F. Farns worth.

"I was drunk," said Kate yesterday,
when she tried to explain away the burg

There is nothing of the bad, bold burg
lar about Kate. Hers is just a case of
liquor and jealousyâ a sort of melodra
matic romance in ordinary life.
THE case of Kate de Costa, charged
with burglary by Mrs. Nellie Yorke,
H came up in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday morning and by common con
sent went over till Tuesday.
Eonds Are Insufficient.
The bonds for COOO accepted for the re
lease of Masfyi Miyakawa. the Japanese
charged with extortion, were examined
by Judpre Conlan yesterday morning. The
Judge did not consider them sufficient and
Ifs'j* -d a bench warrant for Miyakawa's
arre.-t. The Judce learned that after
was released Friday he went |
ptraig:ht fr<".m the City Hall to the office I
of Frank Kane, secretary of the Peclfic
Coast Society for the Suppression of Vice.
Developments are looked for when Miya
i...u.i is broujrht into court. I
and when I was there some little while
my divorced husband, Henry de Costa,
rang the bell and I went to the door. He
asked me if Mrs. Yorke was in, and this
so maddened me that I slammed the dooi
In his face and then went into her pantry
and helped myself to her stores, things
I believed De Costa had bought for her
and which he really should have been
providing for me. And that is all there is
to it."
In 1SS3 the woman charged with burg
lary was married to Henry de Costa, a
coal teamster. Two' children were born
to themâ two girlsâ now aged 10 and 8
years. After nearly fourteen years of
married life De Costa brought suit .for
divorce on the ground of intemperance,
but during the proceedings* for divorce
and after the divorce was granted the
teamster continued to live with the wo
man who was the mother of his- chil
dren. Six months ago he deserted her,
she olalms, to bask in the smiles of the
woman. she t considered to be her friend.
And that is how all the trouble came
about, according to Kate de Costa.
"I have been arrested twice before,"
said Kate, "but only for drunkenness.
This charge of theft is an awijil one. If
Mrs. Yorke will only not prosecute me
I'll go back to work. I'm a domestic, and
I'll give her each month half of my
wages, until she considers I have paid up
all her' claims. But I don't blame de
Costa,

MOTHER-IN-LAW
SERVED AS HIS
CHIEF WITNESS
The dismasted German bark J. C.
Pfluger arrived from Santa Barbara in
tow of the tug Relief early yesterday
morning. The vessel left here on July
11 for Queenstown, and Captain Hoover
reported yesterday that on July 12, when
110 miles south-southwest from San Fran
cisco his vessel was struck by a whirl
wind.
"In a few seconds," says the captain,
"the- mainmast and mizzentopmast was
carried away. The mainmast, with the
mainyard attached, fell on deck, smash
ing two boats and the skids. The remain
der of the wreckage went by the board.
"There was a very heavy sea running,
and it took us nine hours to cut away
the spars. After clearing everything we
bent a new foresail and made for the
coast. When the Conception light was
seen we made sure of assistance, but
nothing came along until July 1<J, when
the Greenwood s-poke us ten miles oft
Santa Barbara. We will get new masts
here and will then proceed on our jour
ney, as the hull is perfectly sound."
Mail Steamer Colon Arrives.
The Pacific Mail Company's Colon ar
rived from Panama and way ports yes
terday. She brought up eleven cabin and
thirty-one steerage passengers. Of the
latter fourteen are Chinese.
Walla Walla Detained.
The Plight Sound steamer Walla Walla
is still detained by the accident to her
machinery, and it will probably be this
afternoon before she gets away. When
the gasket that blow out had been re
placed it was found that soruething was
wrong with one of the pistons. As soon
as that is repaired a start will be made.
The Walla Walla has over 200 passengers
aboard.
"Water Front Notes.
The little steamer Cordelia Heald that
left here for Nome last week was com

ran short of coal up the coast, and ad
verse winds compelled a change of course.
It is now probable that her fourteen pas
pengers will remain at home and not face
the smallpox epidemic.

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
B. F. Brook of Bakersfleld, who Is large
ly identified with the oil interest in the
Kern River district, has been in. Los An
geles and has there talked to a reporter
for the Los Angeles Times concerning the
scrippers and the recent decision by Judge
Ross in Los Angeles. Some of his state
ments indicate the feeling among the oil
men in his section.
"The scrippers," said Mr. Brook, "do
not number over fifty in our district. As
against them are the" people of this and
other communities who have invested
their money in oil property. Take the
district In which I am interested, for ex
ample. - There are twenty square miles of
territory throughout which there are
many producing, oil wells. More than a
million and a half dollars has been spent
within the last year in developing that
district, and now this syndicate of black
mailers (for it is all a blackmailing
scheme) comes in and seeks to becloud
the title to the property on the ground
that it is an agricultural district and
therefore open to being- taken by the
holders of scrip. They know . and any
other person has only to visit the land
to know that it. is in no sense agricul
tural. Why, a crow could not lly. over it
without carrying its supplies, for noth
ing will grow upon it. Thirty thousand
people in this part of the State have made
investments there, and if the scrippers
think they can take that land without a
contest they. are sadly, imetaken. I do not
refer to any, particular individual, but to
the ring which has banded together to
extort money and property from those
who have not the means of making a
tight. There have been Instances where
land has been scripped as agricultural
and a week later the scrippers have ad
vertised their land as the best oil land in
the country. <
"Where is our remedy? In the Lana
Office, of course. If we can get a hear
ing I have no doubt that we will be able
to convince those who have authority over
the Government lands that this scripping
game is a bunko pure and simpleâ a veri
table hold-up, for already some of the
scrippers have approached those whose
lands have been scripped with offers of a
compromise. We have applied for a hear
ing, and if we get it there will be no fur
ther trouble. In the meantime, in re
sponse to our appeal, the Land Office has
suspended action."
Interesting information has been re
ceived concerning the scope of the Inter
national Petroleum Congress, to open at
l'aris next month. The secretary an
nounces that the sessions will begin
August 16 and that they will continue up
to August 2S. The programme embraces
the treatment of topics as follows:
"They Desirability of Recording the Depth of
-Wells In Relation to the Sea Level 1 '; 'The De
sirability of Introducing a Standard Method of
Kxaminlng Petroleum -and Its Products for
Technical and Commercial Purposes." by
Boverton Redwood; "Various Methods or Deep
Boring," by Albert Fauck of Vienna; "Tne
American Petroleum Industry," by Professor
Chandler of New York; "The Examination of
American Petroleum," by Professor Mabery
of Cleveland. O.; "Solid .Hydrocarbons in Pe
troleum Residuals," by Professor Zaliozeckl
of Lemberg; "The Preparation of Lubricating
Oils by Means of Concentration. by Mr. Berg
of Alsace; "The Utilization of Petroleum Pro
ducts for Preserving Timber." by A. Adiasse
vich- "On Borneo Oil," by Paul Dvorkovltz.
"While the prospectors for petroleum are
seeking for indications of oil from bnasta
to San Diego, some suggestions taken
from a pamphlet written by A. S. Cooper.
State Mineralogist of California, may be
acceptable. .
"Surface indications of the presence of
petroleum," writes Mr. Cooper, "consist
of unaltered rocks, white-leached shales
and sandstones, shales burned to redness,
fumaroles, mineral springs and the residue
from mineral springs, such as sebutle,
etc subsidences, natural gas, springs or
petroleum oil and maltha, porous rocks
saturated with bitumen, cracks in shale
and other rocks filled or partly filled witn
bitumen, black silicifled shales.
"The prospector should confine his at
tention to unaltered rocks. The color of
the bitumens where they exist near the
surface of the earth is black, bluish black
and dirty brown. The bitumen- can be de
termined from coal, vegetable deposits,
iron, manganese and other minerals that
closely resemble them by the following
tests: By its bituminous odor and taste;
by melting in the flame of a match or can
dle with a bituminous odor (iron and man
ganese do not fuse and coal and vegetable
matter burn without fusion); by dissolving
in bisulphide of carbon, chloroform and
turpentine. It would be well in prospect
ing for oil to carry a small bottle of one
of these solvents and another small bottle
in v.-hich the substance to be determined
is placed in a comminuted form, and agi
tated. If a brown or black solution ia
formed the substance under examination
is bitumen. ' P : '~'J,
"All streams, pools and other bodies or
water should be carefully inspected. If oil
is present it will float upon the surface,
showing prismatic colors. Compounds of
iron floating upon the surface frequently
show these iridescent colors. Whether this
scum is oil or an iron compound can be
determined by stirring the surface of
the water with a circular motion. If iron
the scum will break into irregular frag
ments; if oil it will form bands of color.
In other words, the iron compound seems
to act and break like a solid, whereas the
oily scum acts like a liquid.
"Frequently gases are seen to ascend
from the bottom of streams and pools of
water. Carburetted hydrogen, or natural
gas, is a far greater indication of the
presence of the bitumens than Is sul
phuretted hydrogen or carbonic acid gas.
Consequently, it is frequently important
to determine between these gases. Car
buretted hydrogen tfurns with a yellow,
luminous flame, whereas sulphuretted
hydrogen burns with a bluish flame. If
carburetted hydrogen is found it is a
nearly certain sign that somewhere in the
formation liquid bitumens exist, although
they may be distant from the place where
the gas issues. '
"All outcrops of the stratified rocks
should be examined. There are generally
better exposures of these rocks on the
sides of streams, canyons and gulches
than elsewhere. The surface of the
ground should also be examined. If any
brown or black material is seen in the
seams of the rocks or saturated porous
strata, the test for bitumens, with sol
vents, as described, should be made. If
natural gas or bitumen Is found upon the
surface of shale, there is strong prob
ability that the bitumen has ascended
vertically through these rock? from
porous strata below, as the. avenues for
the migration of the bitumens are usually
seams and cracks in'the shale, the shale
itself being impervious to the flow of the
bitumens, especially the liquid ones. But
when porous sand is reached, or when the
outcrop is porous sand, it can be presum
ed that the bitumens reached the surface
through the sand. Especially is this liable
to be true if the sandstones stand at a
high angle with the horizon. '
"Outcrops and anticlines can be follow
ed from outside property into the prop
erty being examined and the structure be
considered sufficiently well demonstrated,
so as to justify a person In drilling a
well for oil, even if bitumens were absent
from the surface of the land upon which
the well > is to be drilled and
the exposures of the strata are but slight.
The strike of the anticlines and outcrops
can be determined by a pocket compass.
"If indications of. the presence or bitu
men are sufficient to justify it, a topo
graphical map of the presumed oil terri
tory should be made before Â¦ making a
cross-section of the rock structure. All
indications should be closely examined
and thoroughly studied. Even with the
greatest attention given to these details
before selecting a place to drill a well,
there is danger that the lower parts of
the bituminous strata encountered in the
well may contain water in place of gas
and oil, or may be calcified or siliclfied in
stead of being-bituminized. or that water
has entered the outcrop of the strata at
higher altitudes and ascended through the
formation; floating the oil to the surface
or carrying the same to the* other dip of
the anticline. Theory and observations
cannof be perfect, but are far better than
guessing." ... ; . . . . -.

Republicans should never lose t!*e
Twenty-fifth Senatorial District, .which is
now represented by John Feeney, Demo
crat. Factional fights among Republi
cans have been the cause of their past
defeats. There is a prospect of harmony
this year. Among Republican candidates
for the nomination are Richard II. Jones*.
Daniel Crowley. Dr. C. A. Glover and
James F. Martinonl. Several Democratic
aspirants are already announced, and
among them are James W. Reilly. J. J.
O'Connell. J. J. Lynch. Dr. T. B. W. Lc
land and Michael Hernon.
Stephen A. Byrne is spoken of as Dem
nTatlr candidate for Senator to represent
the Xinetenth Senatorial District. He
was the Thirty-fifth District Democratic
nominee for Assemblyman In 1896 .against
W. H. Cobb. His friends are making an
active contest In his behalf.
Colonel George Stone, chairman rf the
Republican Stat<* Central Committee, will
arrive from the East next Tuesday even
ing, and the Bear Club is making prepa
rations to parade. It is not yet settled
whether the -i.-irarle is to be in honor of
Colonel Stone'? return to duty or of Kddie
Conroy's retirement from the committee.
Republicans throughout the State should
bear in mind that registration for tho pri
mary election closes July 2S. Every Re
publican in California should participate
In the primary election. Delepatiors to
comprise. tho nominating conventions
ought to represent the best elements of
citizenship. Worklngmcn. such as me
chanics, merchants, lawyers, doctors,
farmers and others rncagrd in industrial
pursuits, shoulil be oheson t o represent the
people. The old rounders, political para-
Fltes and grogshop loafers should b<? ex
cluded from the conventions. The small
bosses cannot pass out proxies as of yore,
as only delegates elected by the voters can
serve.

James A. Canavan got drunk yesterday
afternoon and started on a campaign
against the Boxers. On Clay street, a
few doors west of .Kearny, he saw Lul
Gone standing in front of a store. Cana
van darted forth his strong right arm and
struck Gong on the forehead, knocking
him to the sidewalk. Ah Qui, a friend of
Gong, blew a police whistle, whereupon
Canavan smote him on the nose, drawing
a stream of blood.
Gunsmith Bachman. whose place of
business is near by, came upon the scene
and upset Canavan. throwing the fighter
upon hi3 back on the cobbles near the
cable track and kneeling upon him until
the police came and arrested the anti
lioxer. Â¦
The prisoner said that he had been a
member of "The Fighting Forty-third,
that he was "loaded" and glad of it. and
expected to be discharged by the court.
He was charged with two batteries and
one vulgar language, and protested that

posted at the exchange. The news created
a vast amount of discussion and there
were not wanting those who derisively de
clared that the yarn of the vessel having
been sunk was a fish story. Later in the
day, however, when the particulars
leaked out all were ready to admit that
the Bonita had been sunk by a whale and
every British and American deep water
captain in port had a story to tell of well
known vessels that had met with similar
mishaps. Captain Steve Castle, the man
aging owner of the Bonita, is satisfied
that a breeching whale Is responsible for
the loss of the pilot boat.
Captain Castle Explains.
"The mammal was hunting and had a
great mouthful of small fiÂ«h," said Cap
tain Castle. "It was rising to the surlac.e
at the rate of a mjle a minute with its
prey and just as it was ready to breech
into the air it collided with the Bonita.
Result, the Bonita is now fifteen fathoms
deep six miles southeast of tiiu Faral
lones." â¢
The pilot boat Bonita went to sea last
Wednesday morning with Captain George
Scott in 'ommand. With h!m were Cap
tains Alex Swanson, K. M. Freeman.
James Miller and George E. Wallace. The
boatkeeper was Frank Brightfeld. the
steward "Pop" Gannon and the three sail
ors in the crew were named Olson, "An
derson and Jackson.
On 'Friday evening the lookout on the
Donlta sighted the lights of the tug Re
lief with the dismasted bark J. C. Pllu
ger in tow. The pilot boat was hove Â¦ to
and Captain Freeman was sent aboard the
bark in the Bonita's yawl. On his way
both he and the two men who were row
ing him nearly lost their lives. An Im
mense school of small fish surrounded the
boat and, attracted b> the lirht which
the pilot was holding in his hand, they
began jumping into the yawl. For a few
seconds it looked lift" a swamping, but
Pilot Freeman hid the light and made hid
boatmen stop rowing and in a few mq
ments the danger was passed. The ap
proach of the Relief and her tow drove
the fish away.
Came Like a Thunderbolt.
Pilot Freeman's adventure took place
at 7:^0 p. m., and two hours later the
Bonita was making her way slowly In the
direction of the lightship. Without a
moment's notice and like a thunderbolt
out of a clear sky something struck her
"on the port quarter and a few moments
later she was waterlogged. Tor six hours
Captain Scott and two of the crew stood
by thÂ»> sinking schooner, and then she
went down bow first.
"After putting <.'aptain Freeman, aboard
the J. C. Pfluger we started for the light
ship," said Captain Scott. "The sea was
comparatively smooth and the wind light. 1
We were making about -two knots' an
hour and there was nothing In sight. I
was just in the act of going below when
I saw something rising up In the water
alongside the vessel. It butted us on
the port quarter and then seemed to re
bound and gradually sank out of sight.
Perhaps there was no rebound in the
ease of Mr. Whale, and It was simply
our boat, being rushed through the water
bv the impact, but It seemed to us that
the whale bounded back and then -sank
out of sight.
Could Not Keep Her Afloat.
: "A brief examination showed- that' ' the
Bonita was badly stove below the water
line and was "sinking. I got the pumps
to. work, but we could not control' the in
rush, and fifteen minutes tho acci
dent the water was up to The lockers in
the cabin. I got the crew on deck and
had the boats put in the water. At mid
night we kedged the boat, lowered all the
sails. and prepared to leave: f I sent Cap
tains Swanson. Wallace and Miller and
Steward Lannon and two men to the
Grade S,. which, was. near .by, while, tne
surprised lot of men you never saw in
yt>ur life when they heard our story.
About 3:40 a. m. Captain Scott came
aboard and gave us the news of the sink
ing of the Bonita. Soon after he boarded
the Wellington, and yesterday afternoon
I boarded the Colon and came In. No
more whale stories in mine. One adven
ture with a leviathan is enough for me."
Pilots Have Man
Closs Calls.
Since the pilot service for the Golden
Gate began there have been many pilot
boats wrecked, and no one but the pilots
themselves can tell how many "close
calls." Xo matter how hard it blows, the
pilot boat has to be cut. and a dozen times
a month the pilot takes his life in his
hands while seeking to board an incoming
vessel.
Away back in 1S53-54 the pilot boat Sea
Witch was wrecked on Arch Rock. She
ran on the spot In a dense fog, but luckily
all hands were saved before she went
down.
In 1S59 the Dancing Feather went ashore
in Potato Cove and became a total loss.
Her crew was saved. Â¦>
In 1S61 the Julia disappeared and has
nfcve.r been heard from since. All the
pilots had boarded off and a schooner in
distress coming along the boatkeeper and
a sailor went out to her. leaving the Julia
unattended. A freshening breeze started
her away and the men could not catch
her. She gradually ran away from her
pursuers and has never been heard of
from that day to this. The general sup
position Is that she was caught in a squall
off the Farallor.es and went down.
Lost With All Hands.
In 1862-63 the Relief was swamped on
tho bar and went down with all hands.
She had four pilots aboard and a crew of
four men.
in 1S67-6S the Caleb Curtis was swamped
on the bar and all hands were drowned.
Luckily the pilots had all boarded off, so
only the cre'W lost their lives. Afterward
the Caleb Curtis was raised and refuted.
Later she was sold to a sealing firm, but
the captain who went out on her sold her
in Japan and ran away. She is now sup
posed to be a yacht in Chinese waters.
In 1S69 the J. C. Conseus went on the
beach in a dense fog and became a total
loss.
In 1SS0 the Confidence ran on Mile Rock
and went down in a few minutes. The
crew wns saved.
In 18S6 the T. H. Allen was run down
and sunk by the bark Wallacetown. Sev
eral of the crew were injured, but no
lives were lost. Now comes the most
thrilling and peculiar of all the disasters
âthe Bonita's encounter with a whale.
The Bonita -was one of the handsomest
pilot boats ever seen on this coast. She
was 78 tons gross burden. SI feet long, 23
feet beam. 9 feet 6 inches deep and was
built at Port Blakeley in 1S92; going into
commission in June of that year. The
pilot service will not be crippled by her
loss, as Captain Jordan has the America
ready to go into commission at once. She
will be dry docked on Monday morning
and will go out Monday night to relieve
the Gracie S.
boatkeeper, a sailor and myself stayed
by the ship.
"For a couple of hours we hung on to
the main sheet, and then as it looked as
though she might go dt>wn at any mo
ment we cast off. At 3:10 a. m. she was
in her death throes. Shu took a list to
port, gave two or three heavy rolls, then
careened to starboard and finally settled
down head lirst. The last * thing I saw
of the _onita was the end of her main
boom, and it was sticking straight up
like a mast.
"After i he Bonita went down we pulled
to the Gracie S and got aboard her at 3:40
a. m. Soon afterward the steamer Wel
lington hove in sight and I went aboard
as pilot, while the crew of the Bonita
came along as passengers. Captains
Swanson, Miller and Wallace remained
aboard the Gracie S to finish their cruise."
Second Experienc.3 With a Whale.
This is Captain Scott's second experi
ence with a whale. Twenty years ago he
was outside the Heads on the tugboat
Donald and a big leviathan came up to
breathe just as the one that wrecked the
Bonita did. Luckily it came up alongside,
but gave the Donald a stroke with its tail
that broke every dish in the pantry and
disabled the machinerv. Â¦
Late yesterday afternoon Captain Alex
Swanson came in uii the steamer Colon,
which arrived from Panama. His account
of the aflair adds many details to the most
peculiar disaster that has ever oecurrea
off the Golden Gate. Since the pilot serv
ice was inaugurated nine pilot boats have
been wrecked, but not one of them can
compare in graphic details with the loss
of the Bonita.
"Up to the time that whale struck us,"
said Captain Swanson, "it was one of the
most ordinary cruises I had ever been
out on. We left port Wednesday morning
anil not a blessed thing hovo in sight un
til after th<? Uonita was wrecked Friday
night. We had been playing a game or
eribbage. and getting tired of the sport
were going to bed. Wallace was nearly
undressed. Miller v/as resting on the
lounge nnuM was going into the pantry to
get a mouthful to v.-hile Scott was
coming clown the companlonway to see
how we were getting along. Suddenly
there came a crash that made me think
of a man playing on -a xylophone. Every
timber in the boat seemed to have been
struck and every one of them gave forth
a different note. Talk about your "sa<l sen
waves'; that was the saddest refrain 1
have ever heard sounded in my life. Sh*
was as tight u. little craft as ever sailen
the Pacific, was faster than anything of
her class afloat and as comfortable a boat
as man ever sot foot on. It seemed aÂ»
though she were singing her own requiem.
Later on, when Wallace was putting on
my rent and Miller was getting into" my
vest, while 1 was lookirg around for some
thing to cover my suspenders, there did
not seem so much poetry in tho situation.
Was an Old Grayback.
"A? soon as the shock came I rushed on
deck and saw an old grayback whale com
ing up. For a second or two it seemed to
wallow around as though stunned, and
then it ranged up alongside. For a few
seconds it was \ motionless, and then it
started away with a . rush that left a
phosphorescent streak a mile long behind
it. . .
"When V got a chance to look around
Captain Fcott wq|& up to his knees In
water getting the pump ready. Seeing that
the chances of saving the the boat were
desperate; AVnllace. Miller and I went for
ward and got thfl men's things out of the
forecastle while they were at work on the
pumps. By tho tlnv we bad done this and
got back "to tho cabin the. -water, was up
to the lockers and the Bonita was doomed.
We got Into tha boats and pulled away,
but as : she did not seem to sink In the
water wo went back to her and saw by the
light in the cabin, that was still burning,
that the. water -was up over the cabin ta
ble. We secured the, compasses, glasses,
speaking trumpets and anchor light and
then lowered the sails. She began to/ca
reen soon after -the sails were lowered,
and everybody deserted her once more.
"Captain Scott now decided that more
pilots should be at watch on the stations,
so he told Captains Wallace. Miller and
myself off for duty on the Oracle S. At
this time the Gracie was six miles away,
kedged two miles outside the lightship. It
took us two hours' and forty minutes to
row to her, and when we came -alongside
they took us for a lot of pirates and or
dered .us.away. ,Â¦ We.found.Captalns Ers

and Herbert Cripps, stage man
>k^ ager, no longer bow as they pass
by. In spite of the fact that they
both belong to the samp company, cruel
fate crJuina that winsome Connie obey
the heartless Herbert's orders. *
Connie Powell is one of the eight ma**
cottes (spelt with a double "t" and a flnal
"c" at the beauty's suggestion) of the
Dunne and liyiey Company playing at the
California Theater. Herbert Cripps Is the
man who puts the "mascottes" through
the intricate mazes of the dances and
Ftands in the wings and claps his hands
when the chorus ladies are expected to
"face" or "forward march."
Cripps' quarrel with Connie is a most
tanproteselonal one and revolves in most
Inartistic fashion round a monetary basis.
A fine of ?2 for being two minutes, late
at a stage rehearsal first started the
trouble and the climax was finally reach
ed when the fÂ«--t.-hing English maid found
her weekly salary less Jo. tariff levied for
wearing her cap at an angle not pleasing
to the Cripps eagle eye.
"It's just this way." said Connie,
"Cripps wants to quarrel with the 'mas
cottes.' Business is not as good as It
ought to be, and if he gets us in a row
find we pet mad and quit, why we break
the term? r>t our contracts. We are
Ftranded here and the management is in
ovr transportationâ for they don't have to
*Â¦Â¦ * us back then to New York.
The miserable wretch," wont on the
â¢-^Mascotte." "He fined me $5 for wearing
my cap in what I considered a most be
coming fashion. I had it perked over my
ear. in a fetching way. and he came along
*Â»nd said, "I want you to wear that cap
at the back of your head."
" 'I won't,' I said. 'Mr. Dunne and his
wife. Mary Marble, have watched me
from the front nnd say the way I wear
my rap Is Ftunning.*
" 'Five dpllars fine," yelled Cripps, and
with that he shoved five fingers right
I under my nose to emphasize what he was
: saying."
"It was perfectly awful," went on
Mabel Powell. Connie's big sister; "Con
nie was aghast for a moment and then
j she looked as if she wanted to cryâ but
she didn't."
"You bet I didn't." chimed in Connie.
"I would not cry for a man who wears
nanny-goat whiskers on his chin and
waggles them when he gets mad.
"But I'm not the only one," went on
the little Powell. Neliie Bly was dread
fully sick and had to stay off two nights.
When she returned Cripps docked her for
four nights and when due complained he
told her that the company was losing $500
a v.eek and she ought to be glad that she
was getting any salary at all.
"It's just this way," said the dainty
Connie in conclusion. "You see. we are
stopping at first-class hotels and Cripps
thinks we are living loo well. The fact
of the matter is some r.f us are getting a
bigger salary than some of the princi
pals-."
ThÂ«* eight "masoottes." upon whom, ac
cording to Miss Powell, the managerial
wrath is being poured, are Mabel Powell,
Nellie Payne. Vivian Austin. Bertha Dun
ham. Mollie Hoffman, Nellie Bly, Theresa
Ropgiero and Connie Powell.
"Of course. I'm easily the best of them
all." said Connie, "and that's why I sup
pose Cripjis especially hates me. But I
love him." said the maseotte par excel
lence with a crunch of her pretty teeth.
Then Mabel Powell, with a bewitching
tc?s of her pretty blonde head, said "1>â n
him." and after that the conversation
languished.
Manager Cripps was rather averse to
discussing Connie Powell.
"There is very little to say about the
girl," he said. "I fined her because she
was impertinent and insubordinate. She
is always 1 late and pays no attention to
business. She is clever and capable, but
f poils It all in her endeavor to make her
self conspicuous."
CONNIE POWELL, A CHORUS LADY WITH A BIG SALARY.
The prosecution in the ca3e of AnseMna
M. Abbott, charged with assault to mur
der, for shooting De Witt Clinton, the
actor, concluded its case yesterday before
Judge Mogan, and a continuance was
granted till Tuesday at the request of ex
judge Graham, the defendant's attorney.
Clinton was up again for cross-examina
tion, and he had to admit that be had re
ceived other money from the defendant
besides the J10 in Omaha. She sent him a
registered package containing $4t> to Jop
lln. Mo., but although his receipt was prÂ»
duced for. the package he denied there
was any money in It. He acknowledged
that he got $30 from her later than April
last. $3) -of which - he had repaid. Ho
urgently needed the money at the time,
as his mother was "on an operating table
in Portland, Or." â¢ He had at the sama
time written to two of his uncles for
money.
in this city Clinton first met Miss Ab
bott on June 10. That was a Sunday
nisjnt, and she called at the Grand Opera
house after the performance, tie went
with her to her room and there told her
tneir relations must cease, as there was a
wide chasm between them. As he wa3
leaving she was very anxious that he
should return, and she said: "Put this
diamond ring on your finger. If you havo
it I know you will return to me." He ob
jected, so ne said, but she insisted, and ho
anally permitted her to place the ring on
his tinger. He wore it on his watch cnaiit
till the following Thursday and sent It
back to her by special messenger. HÂ©
also sent a note that he could not see her
again. She hud called at the theater the
previous night in a drunken condition and
made a scene. He put her on passing cars
three or four times, but she always
jumped off and continued to make things
disagreeable for him. threatening to "fix"
him. The next nightâ Thursdayâ she shot
him. He admitted that he knew she was
a "street walker" when ho received tho
moneys from her.
A letter written by the defendant to
Clinton after she had received back tha
ring was introduced for identification. It
was couched in the vilest language.
Policemen Winzler and Tillman testified
to making the arrest and taking the re
volver from the defendant. Her hair was
disheveled, but they saw no marks on her
throat, although they admitted th*>y did
not look for any. The theory of the de
fense is that Clinton grabbed the youns
woman by the throat before she shot him.

THE CULPRIT IN THE CAGE.
THE sister of Police Officer Hurd has written a letter to him from
Shanghai, telling of the atrocities of the Boxers and Inclosing a pho
tograph of a Chinese criminal who was tortured to death for mal
treating a young girl. After referring to the Boxers the lady writes:
Lust nieht ve were all In a great state of excitement. There- were rumors afloat
that some Boxers were In the Immediate vicinity of Shal. I sent for my friend, the
Russian Consul, and he put all my fears at rest. Don't you worry about me. as there
is absolutely nothing in the way of dange r here. I know that the papers will bÂ» full of
a lot of stuff, but don't believe It.
I am sendingr a photo of a man who was captured in thÂ© Chinese city and put In a.
wooden cage, the top of which is of solid wood with a hole in It large enough for his
neck to go through. If you will look you will see that hs is standing on stores, and
each day they took so many stones from under his feet until finally he would have
no support for his body and eventually strangle or rather hang by his neck. I forgot
to mention that they gave him no food. He waÂ» expected to live from five to seven
days, but luckily for him. he died on the third day. If I told you this you would no
doubt disbelieve me, so I send you the photo taken by myself to confirm it.
This man was a perfect fiend. He assaulted a little girl 7 years of age and also
gouged the eyes out of two Chinamen with his thumb and committed a number of
horrible offenses. You can imagine what Chinese punishments are like.

CANADIANS WIN.
CHICAGO. July 21. -The fifth tourna
ment of the Northwestern Cricket Asso
ciation came to a close at Parkside to
day, when the annual international match
between the Canadian and American
branches was won by Canada by forty
three runs in the first innings. The out
(tprne wan as unexpected as the match
playÂ«*l last year In Winnipeg, when the
Americans won.
With thÂ«> best men from the Minnesota,
Denver, Chicago and Omaha associations
to select from, it seemed likely that the
American tram would prove too ?trong
for th^ Manitoba contingent, which had
to do duty for Canada. But the Canadians
won a clever victory and if the two in
nir.M could have been played to a finish
a fine etrucRle Â¦would have resulted.
Captain Fairbanks, for the American
team, won the to*s and went to the bat.
The start was disastrous, two wickets
being down for four runs. FYom this be
frinnlnjf th* side never recovered. ThÂ«

GOLF MATCHES PLAYED
ON HAPPY VALLEY LINKS
Two Competing Teams Play the First
of a Series of Three
Games.
Two teams of ladies of the San Rafael
Golf Club, one captained by Mrs. R. Gil
man Brown and the other by Mrs. Frank
S. Johnson, began a series of three games
over eighteen holes, match play, on the
Happy Valley links yesterday morning at
i* o'clock. One round was played in the
forenoon and the other in the afternoon.
The players in each team were ranked in
the order of their skill, Mrs. R. G. Brown
being matched against Miss Alice C. Hoff
man. In the morning Mrs. Brown was
two down in her match against Miss Hoff
man, but in the afternoon she wiped off
the score against her and ended the second
eight up, or six up on the two rounds.
Miss Eaith McBean being absent, her op
ponent, Mrs. F. H. Green, received two
holes. Mrs. Frank Johnson received two,
Mrs. Heazelton not being: present. The full
results are shown in the table:

tor to let us shoot on his property. He
said that a short time ago two well
dressed men did the same thing, and while
he was away made a dessert of the dairy.
I told him we had been weaned and he
turned us loose on his land.
"We went after do\'es. I saw one. It
was in a cage alongside the milkhouse,
and whatever slaughter I may have com
mitted was not for lust of game but for
spite on account of that foundry hotel. I
will never go huntins again, so help me."
Georce says that Morrisey did not shed
a drop of blood, but that he got lost in
the brush and alarmed the dairy with his
vociferations. After watching Mr. Mor
rlsey's manner of handling a gun the
stage carpenter decided to take the shells
from the manager's weapon, and as a re
sult there were no casualties. It is stated
on good authority that when Mr. Morrisey
and his trusted servitors reached the
OrphHim safely they knelt down and
lifted' up their voices to the Providence
that had permitted them to reach home
without beinp shot.

arrested, and that his long deferred va
cation extended over a period of fourteen
and a half hours.
JOIIN MORRISEY has taken that
lonp-threatened vacation. . This
statement may bo received with In
credulity by his numberless friends,
but Mr. Morrisey acknowledges the corn,
and in extenuation states that he was in
veigled into the act; that the act was the
result of mental aberration and will never
be repeated.
The famous manager of the Orpheum
has been so busy during the past five
years crowding twenty-five hundred peo
ple into his playhouse seven nights in the
week, with three matinees thrown in, that
he has had no opportunity to go forth and
devastate the game preserves of the State.
However, he has finally "went" and' he
"has came." His account of the affair is
probably the most accurate.
"I did not seek this notoriety," said Mr.
Morrisey apologetically. "It was thrust
upon me. A supposed friend of mine in
vited me to go shooting on Papinta'3
ranch. Papinta is the noted dancer, you
know, and while I had first thought of
going to Colorado or the Northwest in
search of big game, I concluded that the
ranch near Concord and small birds would
do. So I bought a swell outfit, and ac-

Stockton 7, Oakland 1.
Nothing but accident* and slow baseball
were thrust at the fanatics yesterday
afternoon during the diamond fight for
the "booby" prize. The tail ender* were
on deck and the bad ones from Oakland
were very bad Indeed. The new Mr. Jones
twirled for the fancy Brummela and the
Millers ground him to powder, while
Whalen of Stockton was practically un
touched.
In the second Inning Lockhead, original
ly a short Â«top, who never let* a ball pass
him, stopped everything In Might. aÂ»
usual. This time he took the epheroid
on the medulla oblongata anÂ»i for three
minutes wan oblivious to the game, but
pretty much of an astronomer. The nÂ»:.\t
Inning Courtney, who came to the plate
as if he were shooting the chutes, collid
ed with diminutive Mangerina. Both were
laid out and some U-gpulling restored
Mangerina, but Courtney, whose cords
were twisted, wan forced to retire from
the game. The fourth brought a punch
in the stomach to Hutchinson, whose wind
forsook him for a time. Then to cap the
climax Whalen broke a bat, giving the
laugh to Lockhead's cranium. That Is
the lint of casualties. No deaths.
Stockton found the going easy In the
first two Innings. At the outset McCarthy
reached the Initial sack on a hit to right,
purloined the next bag and made a pedes
tal of third on Pace's single to left. Then
there was some verdant playing on the
part of the Dudes, who tried to chut out
Pace at second and McCarthy at the plate
with equal lack of success. McCarthy
scored.
In the second the Millers had a merry
time. Lockhead's top piece was made a
target of. so McGucken did the running:.
Lockhead going to the benches with a
halo about his head. Then Babbitt went to
first on Jones' error and Moore followed
by Lange's bad throw to second, filling
the bags. A base on balls to Courtney
forced McGucken. Then Whalen flew to
left, Babbitt scoring on the throw in.
After that Oakland was awake for a
minute, shutting out Moore and Courtney
when they attempted to land at the rub
ber. The last out not only retired the
side but also Courtney who came in col
lision with Mangerina, necessitating some
leg pulling.
In the third the Dudes fell to plate
scraping. Two men had come and gone
when Hutchinson reached first on Lock
head's error and stole second, scoring on
Francks' hit. Francks tried to make two
bags en the hit, but died at 6econd.
McCarthy crossed the rubber in the
fifth, making the score. 4-1 in Stockton's
favor.
The eighth brought three runs to Stock
ton. McCarthy started with a hit and
McGucken Jogged to first on four bad
ones. Then Pace made a hit, scoring Mc-
Carthy. Another hit, this time by LoVrlc
head, scored McGucken and Pace. After
that Moore reached first on a hit, but the
side was soon retired by three successive
deaths. The score:

ON LAST DAY
Successful and the Sport
Excellent.
Recent Meeting Was Entirely
A good card of coursing was run off m
the first round of the eighty-eight dog open
stake yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
Favorites held their own throughout the
afternoon, although a few upsets were re
corded at good odds. Bald Eagle, quoted
at 6 to 1. took the flag from Bad Boy. The
talent took a chance at these big odds, as
Bad Boy has teen on the shelf for some
time with a bad leg and has not rounded
up to expectations.
Vulcan ran In great shape, leading Sweet
Emma in a bye about four lengths. He
meets Bohe In the second round to-day,
and Judging from the form hÂ» displayed
In the rundown his chances of getting the
flag from Perigo's fast black one look
good.
Lexington, a 2 to 1 favorite, went oat
to Thornhlll after having things his own
way. He allowed Thornhiil tie the score,
and even then would not make an effort
to reach the game. "When close to tha
fence he seemed afraid and kept away,
Thornhlll taking the turn and kill.
The raising of the red flag after tho
course between Sweet Music and Anchor
served to make the talent say some hard
things of Curtis & Son's entry- Anchor
was a favorite at the almost prohibitive
Â» odds of 3 to 1. Favor of tho hare had
I much to do with deciding the course, but
as Sweet Music went to the front Anchor
lost heart and could not get on the game
j again.
Floodgate showed grand formâ the best
i of the day. He gained a lead of six
j lengths over Beauty Spot and ran all
I around her. Floodgate stands a good
! chance for the stake, and with the izn-
I provement he has shown lately is likely to
1 be an important factor In any company.
Mose. on the short end at 2H to 1. beat
Â¦ Candelaria anJ showed his old-time form.
j Auckland also ran a good race. Pepita beat
| Agamemnon after an undecided. At the
j first attempt Agamemnon led well, but in
, the run. when c 2 to 1 favorite, went to
pieces and scored but one point against
I Peplta's eight.
Royal Flush did not show any too well,
but it is a trick of his to come back strong
on the second day.
The winners for to-day In the second
round look to be Maud S. Twin City Girl.
Royal Flush, Sir Pasha, May Hempstead.
The Grafter. St. Michael. Rural Artist.
Mose, Sara. Vulcan. Wanda. Peplta. May
flower. Floodgate. Controller. Battleship,
Sweet Music. For Glory. Royal Union, Kid
McCoy and Crawford Braes.
Vulcan. Floodgate. The Grafter ar.d
Royal Flush have a good chance to get
well down the card.
Crawford Braes beat O'Hara in tho last
course of the day at the false odds of 4
to 1.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, July 21.
. Because of mental distress and physical
exhaustion, caused by being lost in Oak
land while searching for her husband,
Mrs. Edward Earle, wife of the rector of
the Red Bluff Episcopal church, who has
been officiating in this city, is in a critical
condition at St. Luke's Hospital In San
Francisco. For days she was deliricus,
end even now the attending surgeons fear
the result of a serious surgical operation
which will be resorted to in the hope of
saving her life.
The circumstances surrounding: Mrs.
Earle's collapse are unusual. Her hus
band had been stopping at Oakland oi> hi3
way to Ked Bluff to occupy the pulpr. of
the Church of the Advent, East Oakland,
during the vacation of Rev. William Car
son Shaw, the rector. The day he bepan
preaching Mrs. Earle. with a six-month
cld baby, arrived here, accompanied by
Mrs J. N. Chipman. Both ladies were
strangers to the city. At Sixteenth street
station they left the train. Inquiring of a
street car conductor for the church, they
boarded a car to which they were directed.
But through some misunderstanding the
ladies were told to alight at the Seventh
day Adventists" church at Twelfth and
Brush streets, miles from the Bast Oak
land church which they sought.
Upon discovering the mistake Mrs.
Earie. worn and tired from her journey,
became very nervous. She started to
walk, and with her child went afoot after
a long wandering to the church rectory
at 13C Eleventh avenue. The strain wa3
so severe that the exhausted woman col
lapsed and her condition became so seri
ous that she was sent to the hospital in
San Francisco, where her mind gave way.
Her physicians are Dr. d'Evelyn and Dr.
Rev. Dr. Karle Is greatly distressed
about the unfortunate episode. The fam
ily came to California last fall and settled
in Humboldt County. The climate there
Was not favorable to Mrs. Earle's health
or the rector's, so he secured an assign
ment to Red Bluff. The prostrated wife's
condition is such that the clergyman will
be detained here indefinitely.

OAKLAND. July 21.â Rev. C.
II. Hobart with three min
isterial companions, has
won fame as a disciple of
Xlmrod, the mighty hunter of an
cient days. The distinguished pas
tor of the First Baptist Church,
returned to-day from an expedition
into the mountains of Plumas
County, where the clerical hunts
man made a hit by bringing down
a magnificent buck with his trusty
rifle at long range. Dr. Hobart
outdid his companions by slaying
the only deer that was killed dur
ing the hunt. He brought home a
fine pair of antlers as a trophy of
the chase. The shot which captured
the noble denizen of the forest wa3
a clean dead center, striking the
breast as the deer stood facing the
preacher, in the wooded canyon.
It was packed Into camp, three
miles distant, and juicy deer steak3
were served that night to the
clergymen at their campflre supper.
Dr. Hobart's companions were Rev.
C. M. Hill and Rev. W. C. Hill of
this city and Rev. Dr. Youngr of
San Jose.
All of the party had excellent
success with their fishing, but as
hunters, the Baptist preacher was
the victor.

Egyptian Cat Mummies.
While the Egyptian children no doubt
had as great regard for cats as the chil
dren of tc-day, the parents had a sti'.l
higher regard, rising into worship. So
great was this regard that the cats cama
to be looked upon as sacred, the cat wor
ship became a part of the religion of tho
race, while this worship found expression
in great temples erected in honor of the
cats who died. Shaving the eyebrows on
the death of a cat in the family was a
favorite means of showing the distress of
the household.
So it was but natural to bellefe that In
the future life the cat3 would live again
Â¦with their young masters ar.d mistresses,
contributing to their happiness In the ce
lestial land. On the death of the tabbv
all due ceremony was observed, and with
tender care she was embalmed and placed
Â¦with the mummies of her family. You
may see such muramies in the British
Museum, wrapped in their cerements, fold
upon fold enswathlng the body with as
great solicitude as though it were tho
body of the child who had owned the ca:
for its companion.
The cases in which the cats were placed
after embalming were capital representa
tions of the cat in life. Many of them were
of carven wood, remarkably lifelike af
fairs, the form and ev^n the Individuality
of expression b^ing admirably preserved.
Now and then some cat belonging to som*
more aristocratic family when it departed
for the heavenly land received a case of
bronze, beautifully ornamented Â«nd In all
ways more in kceplns with the standing
of the family. Some of the cat cases arÂ»
curiously decorated, and some of the faces
are fitted out with queerly made eyes. In
laid with obsidian or rock crystal; others
are done In colored paste, the effect fre
quently being decidedly grotesque, ThÂ«
object in giving eyes to the case was thac
the spirit cat misht have an opportunity
to look out. An opening down tho center
of the case divided it into halves, so that
the cat. when embalmed and ready for her
last long journey to the land of taa
blessed, could easily be Inclosed.
The utmost care waa given to thesa
friends of the little children, that their
lives might be prolonged to a ripe old ass.
Their food was prepared so that they
might not only receive the most gnsta
tory pleasure possible, but so that they
might be richly nourished. OnÂ© favorit*
dish -was bread soaked in rr.i'.k and raLxed.
with chopped fish; surely no more tempt
ing viand could be placed before the most
exacting feline. In rÂ»any cases cats wero
kept in and about tt.z temples which wera
sacred to the many gods of Egypt, and
greater care could not have been given t9
human beings than that which was ac
corded to the cats.

THE LATE RE V. H. H. RICE.

111S Broadway. July 21.
The Board of Supervisors and County
Clerk Jordan have directly clashed in tbfl
question of registration deputies. Tha
County Clerk has refused point blank to
allow the men named by the Supervisors
to go to work in his office, and the board
has no method of compelling him to allow
the men to go to work.
The- County Clerk not only refused to
accept the men named by the Supervisors
to go to work, but he to-<iay appointed
four special deputies, without authority
from the board, and will demand that tha
board pay their claims.
It has become a matter of direct defi
ance on both sides. The Supervisors
defied the County Clerk when they re
fused to allow him to name the assist
ants, and he has replied with a direct
defiance by appointing hia own men la
the face of a refusal on the part of the
board to allow him any help at all.
The Supervisors to-day held a special
session and got through with the work
for which the session was called very
quickly. Finding that County Clerk Jor
aan would not allow their appointees Into
his office they rescinded the appointment
of the ten men made on Thursday. The
motion to rescind was made by Supervisor
Talcott. who suggested that there was
time to make the appointments later.
Supervisor Church then called up the)
application of County Clerk Jordan for
$1100 for extra help on the Great Register,
and moved that it be denied. Thl3 wag
seconded by Mitchell and the motion waa
carried.
This latter action was taken because It
was generally understood that County
Clerk Jordan would make some appoint*
ments himself and the beard wished to
go on record as far as possible as to re
fusing to recognize such appointments
and refusing to pay the claims that will
come in later.
County Clerk Jordan thl3 afternoon arÂ»-
Eolnted H. E. Majrlll. H. R. French. K.
h Hughes and "W". J. Henderson as special
registration deputies and ordered the men
to report for work Mnnday. Six other*
will be appointed at that time and their
claims will be spnt to the Supervisors for
payment. The Supervisors will reject thÂ«
bills and the men will have to appeal to
the courts to settle the lrsrality of their
appointment and the liability of the Su
pervisors In the matter of remuneration.

Salaries Be Paid by the

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, July 21.
A movement has been started in Oak
land toward securing a nojw charter to
supplant the present patchwork affair un
der which the city has been working for
ten years. A petition has been prepared
and is being circulated and very largely
signed asking the City Council to call a
freeholders' election for the purpose of
framing an entirely new plan of city gov
ernment.
The present city charter was framed in
1SS9, before the adoption of the constitu
tional amendment making city charters
supreme over general laws. As a conse
quence the charter has been torn full of
holes by general statutes. This, with some
amendments made a few years ago, has
rendered the present instrument most un
satisfactory. The new movement bears
evidence of success.
The text of the petition is as follows:
To the Honorable City Council of the City
of Oakland: Gentlemenâ The undersigned
citizens and taxpayers of the city of Oak
land hereby respectfully request your hon
orable body to call an election, as provided
by section S, article XI of the Constitution,
for the naming of a board of freeholders to
draft a new charter for the city of Oakland.
Although the present charter was a great
improvement upon the former one, far better
suited to the needs of a large and growing
city and, in the main, an instrument draft
ed with wisdom and good Judgment, still an
experience of eleven years under this char-Â»
ter has disclosed many particulars in which
further Improvements might be. made. In
eluding several changes which seem to be
most advisable and urgent. The particulars
In which changes should be made are so nu
merous and varied in character that we be-
IievÂ« it unwise to attempt them In the way
of further patchwork by amendment. This
latter expedient would be unsatisfactory at
the best, to say nothing of the possibility of
a chaos in the instrument by the passage
of some amendments and rejection of
others.
With the llsht of these past years under
the existing charter and many Judicial In
terpretations bearing upon it. we believe
that a carefully chosen board of freeholders
âmen of hlph ability, mature, business
Judgment and experience In municipal affairs
âwould draft and submit such a clear, con
sistent and able charter as would place the
government of the city upon a sound, wise
and progressive bai>is, would prove of Ines
timable value to the city and open up for
It a new era of prosperity.
Present City Charter Has Been Torn
j Full of Holes by the Ope
ration of General
Petition Asking Council to
Call Special Election of
Freeholders.

. c mall circle of intimate friends. The ar
rival at Camp Merritt of the first regi
mentF of volunteers brought her out ct
her seclusion. She sent to the boys, who
afterwards became "her boys." wagon
loads of fruit and other crpature conn
forts to make their rude life more bear
able. Even at that time h^r name was un
known outride of the camp and not until
s=he gave the Red Cross ladies her chock
for a large amount did people begin to
wonder at her identity.
AH through, the days of the camp her
acts of solicitude for the soldiers were
manifold, and not a volunteer but looked
upon her as a fairy sodmother.
It was, however, only when the city
was preparing to welcome back the First
California from the Philippines that Mrs.
Townsend electrified the city and made
possible a prreatÂ»receptlon by her generous
bids for boxes at the Orpheum sale for
the voluntf-ers benefit.
At the reception to California's sons
Mrs. Townsend was an honored guest.
After that she modestly retired to her
home and up to the time of her death
was only heard from through her chari
ties. Her last noble" work was her con
tribution to the benefit fund for brave
Fireman Sweeney.

but Its delivery will be somewhat delayed
owing to the fact that the storage ca
pacity at Port Costa is too limited to
handle it. The crop will necessarily have
to depend upon interior warehouses for
storage. This is a blessing to the railroad
company, as it will partially relieve the
pressure and enable us to handle other
products that must be transported
promptly.
"Recently the Southern Pacific Com
pany purchased the Carson and Colorado
Railroad and will extend It and open up
a new field, which will largely benefit the
mining, agricultural and livestock indus
tries of that region. The through busi
ness of the company to and from the
State gains steadily in volume. Among the
new features of traffic is the movement
of coke from the coal fields of Alabama
to California points, all of which was for
merly supplied by English collieries. In
conclusion, traffic has grown so splendilv
that it is now a question of equipment and
not of business."
"Notwithstanding the quiet season the
passenger business is good," said E. O.
McCormick. passenp-er traffic manager of
the Southern Pacific. "Furthermore, It Is
improving} steadily and most satisfactor
ily. The gain is as much local as general,
as. shown by the regular returns from sta
tions along the line in local terrltory-
These conditions are not confined to Cali
forniaâthey exist all over the country,
Eastern roads being rushed with travel.
You can say as a clincher that we are
confidently looking for and carefully pre
paring for the greatest tourist travel this
winter that has ever been known in the
history of the State, and that is good
enough news for. anybody."
The rest of the story tells Itself.
Splendid Growth of Enterprises
and Trafficâ Trade Out
look Excellent. ?
T7 F there Is a man looking for work and
who doubts the existence of prosperity
j| on the Pacific Coast let him go to the
ticket offices and freight yards of the
railroad companies and watch the ebb and
flow of a mighty traffic, the equal of
which has never before been seen on the
slope. The business of California Is going
along on a flood tide, the pace of which
is calculated to satisfy the requirements
of the most exacting. A verification of
the foregoing statements Is found In the
everyday traffic of the Southern Pacific
Company. This great artery of trade in
so far as the transportation of goods is
concerned is gorged with business, and
the officials of the corporation see no re
lief therefrom. Their solo efforts are di
rected to handling It.
"The greatest Inconvenience we suffer
now," Bald General Freight Agent A. D.
Shepard of the Southern Ppciflc Company
yesterday, "is an inability-; to purchase
greatly needed equipment or to secure ma
terial with which to build it. Eastern
builders are so overwhelmed with orders
from roads on the other side of the divide
that they cannot attend to our wants, and
the concerns that handle supplies for such
work are in the same position. I presume
the general public does ndt realize the
scope of the growth of enterprises In this
State, to say nothing of the other portions
of the coast. The best way to Illustrate
this is to enumerate a few facts that tell
their own story.
"For Instance, one of the best indica
tions of present and coming prosperity is
the fact that we have had more demands
for the construction of side switches to
accommodate private enterprises -than In
any one year :n the history of the com
pany. This means the establishment of
manufactories that require private rail
facilities to handle their products. Down
in Madera there Is being established a
large smelter to handle- ores from the
mountains, also a sawmill of large capac
ity and modern equipment. The Sierra
Railway Company Is building an extension
for the purpose of opening up the traffic
of the West Side Flume and Lumber Com
rany.
"The Copper King Company, which has
large mines near Sanger. is building a big
Bmelter near Martinez, and I suppose the
general public knows .nothing about the
fact. We are building sidetracks now to
accommodate the plant, and the works
will soon be In operation. Another smelter
is now being built by New York parties at
Reno. Nev. 'By reason of the better times
the Mountain Copper Company of Keswlck
is rehabilitating its plant and preparing
for heavy business. Many mills on the
mother lode are increasing their plants
and shipping sulphurets to tide water to
be reduced at an increased profit.
"At Floriston has just been completed
the most modern and best equipped paper
mill in the United States, and I don't sup
pose the people know anything about it.
It cost J7M.000. Two miles below this great
enterprise is the plant of the Truckee
Electric Company, which is being con
structed to convey power to Virginia City
to be used to rehabilitate the abandoned
mines by working low grade ores and the
dumps from the high grade mines. These
dumps contain 6.000.000 tons of ore that can
be worked at a good profit. Mines now
producing high grade ores are shipping
their product to tide water, to be reduced
at a profitable figure. â¢ . . .
"Arizona Is enjoying her share of the
general prosperity. The big copper prop
erties are booming. The larger compa
nies are putting in modern machinery in,
vast quantities and rebuilding their rail
ways that connect with the main rail
way lines. Here is where the oil Industry
naturally comes in. It does not sound rea
sonable, but it is a fact.- that, notwith
standing the - great : rapidity^ with which
the industry has expanded the product is
not equal to the demand. , Its importance
has not been appreciated thus far. We
have now under construction a large num
ber of oil cars to carry fifty tons each in
order to accommodate the traffic.
"Aside " from these matters there is
coming a citrus crop that Is estimated at
6700 carloads, to say nothing of the mighty
output of green fruits now going to East
ern markets. In the San Joaquin Valley
new wineries are being constructed to
handle the second crop of grrapea, that has
been heretofore~"worthless. The prune and
raisin raisers have organized for the bet
terment of their condition, all of which Is
the forerunner of fair prices to the
farmer. This means widespread activity
in the demand for agricultural machinery,
lumber and all things that form a part or
the farmers*, needs. . < , :

hay dealers. This is now ccmin? tn. some of
it ahead of tlce, as the farmers are eajer to
dtlJver and get their money. Arrivals have
b*en so heavy that the market has softÂ»ned
dvring the week, though the dealers do net let

NEW YORK. July II.â The Financier says
this week: The statement of the Xew York
clearing bents for the week endlnjr July II is
again at variance with the presumably accurate
estimate cf the week's trade and speculative
operation' Instead cf a rr.odÂ»rate rain in sur
plus there was a violent rise of H.m.773 in re
serve, brir.ginj: the total excess above legal re
quirements to C4.tSl.900. the hig-hest figure
reached Â«ir.ce last February- This Is In distinct
contrast witn the movement of money at this
season la past years, but when the statement
is subjected to detailed analysis the reneral to
ta!Â» are made clear. The Xatiocal City Bank.
for instance, reports a gain ia specie for the
we?k 0! no less than S3.0CP.C00 and as the cash
held bv all the banks are only about three and
three-quarter millions, it Is clear that the re-
Si-r\e haidir.ss cf the other institutions are at
least four millions less than a week ago. The
changes in the other leading items can be
trae*d to the same source, so that while the
Statement remains illogical. frr;ai a tra.de stand
point, soce &f its puzziing features are cieart-i
\ip. In view cf the facts stated, tt ts idle to
discs?* the influence of the exhibit in- the gen
eral money market- In a rec<rral seose the de
crease ir< loans was not unexpected, as the gold
exports do not figure fully in the averages, the
inferer.ee is that the banks do not held the
arscunt of reserve Indicated. While the market
for loans is easy there is a general tendency
trv bold for higher quotations and prediction*
are not wanting that rates will go higher be
fore September. Tne interior is stiH sending
money to the*? center*, and the sain from the
PaciSe Coast m&y continue indefinitely. Part
Of this goll may ra to Europe, altho-igrh the
r-rÂ«sÂ«-t movement la belnc sustained en the
clcsest mania of profit, a fact that is not
escaping attention is the expansion la national
bar.k circulation in Xew Yerk City. The sain
!aÂ»t week wa* nearly three-quarters of a tr.il
licn aroJ th* larger banks arpear to favcr teav->

Sad Condition of Affairs Found by
Police in the OTarrell
Home.
The home of* Matt O'Farrell, located In
a basement at 1003 Powell street, present
ed a wretched appearance and told a pitia
ble story of low life and neglect when Ser
geant Christianson and Policeman E. C
Gould entered it last night. O'Farrell and
his wife were beastly intoxicated, a baby
of sixteen months rolled crying on the
floor, while three other children three,
eight and twelve years respectively, stood
around hungry and unkempt. The rooms
were in disorder and filthy, and, the ap
pearance of the children showed how lit
tle attention had been given them while
their parents abandoned themselves to
their drunken orgies.
O'Farrell returned from Cape Nome
three weeks ago with $600. Instead of
using the money on his family he and his
wife spent all but $50 for drink. They
have kept themselves Intoxicated ever
since. The little home was neglected and
the children went hungry.
Finally the police learned of the sad
condition of affairs and visited the squalid
premises. O'Farrell and his wife were
taken to the California-street police sta
tion, where charges of drunkennness ana
cruelty to minor children were placed
against them. Maggie, aged sixteen
months: Willie, aged three years, and
Mamie,Â«nged eight years, were placed in
charge of the matron at the Central police
station. The oldest boy, Eddie, aged 12
years, made his escape.

of F. Loul King of the San Jose Conserv
atory, with his sister, Florence, are now

months ago, at Sherman-Clay Hall, great
things were prophesied for him. and It ls
understood that his Berlin master ls In
full accord with the favorable estimate of
tho boy's powers.

is now domiciled here for some time. Mr.
Samuels began his vlolinistlc career in the
hands of Henry Heyman. with whom he

Fred Belasco " Returns From Paris
With a Fund of Experiences
That Cost Him Hard
Cash.
Fred Belasco, proprietor of the Alcazar,
returned Friday from a visit to the Paris
Exposition, and "Welcome, .Fred!" in
blazing electric lights adorns "the theater
entrance. Belasco returns with many
anecdotes of his struggles with the lan
guage and the people who fleece the
stranger within their gates.
"While all Americans," Mr. Belasco
said .last night, "are ashamed of the
United States building, hidden like a toy
house between the magnificent Turkish
and Italian buildings," Callfornians have
every reason to be. proud of. the Califor
nia exhibit on the Avenue de l'Opera. It is
one of the sights of the exposition, and
Europeans are amazed at the exhibit oÂ£
oranges particularly.
"Americans are leaving Paris as fast as
they can get out, because they are beins
so scandalously robbed. Prices on every
thing have gone away up. In the shops
where prices were formerly marked there
is no marking now, and if the proprietors
get a chance they will give -you shop
worn goods instead of the articles that
you buy from the show case.
"Visitors. should beware of the stores
with 'English spoken' on the windows.
That is the cue 'good thing." You go in
and inquire, 'Parlez-vous Anglais V That
starts everybody jabbering until a sales
man comes up from the rear of the store
and answers 'Oul.' He shows you every
thing you don't want, until finally in des
peration you buy something, paying two
or three prices for it because you had the
nerve to ask if English was spoken.
"I bought a straw hat In .Paris for 25
francs. In New York I met an old friend
and showed him my purchase with pride.
He Inquired the price. 'Five dollars!
Why, man, that straw is of the very
cheapest kind. You can get all you want
of such hats here for a dollar each.' He
convinced me by showing me hats with
the prices marked, but 1 am still wearing
my Paris hat, for spite.
"In. the few shops, cafes, etc.. where
English is spoken, they ask you the first
thing whether you are English or Ameri
can. If you Â« are English you get cold
water; if you are American they soak
you. I told one fellow I -was an Ameri
can and he got all my money. Another
fellow asked me the question, and I said
to my wife: .'What shall I say? If I say
American he will take my overcoat.' She
said, 'Tell him you are English.* I did,
and he was so insolent that I was very
sorry for the deception 1 had practiced.
The next time, the question was .asked
me I said, 'I am neither.' 'Sapristi, what
ees ze monsieur?', the fellow asked. 'I'm
a N good thing,' I said. He did iyK seem
to understand and I kept my overcoat
and escaped insult. :, --, .-.Jr 1 â¢-Â¦

ITcw Complaint Against Arnold.
Oormac & Donolrae, attorneys represent
ing the British Consul, filed a new com
plalst yesterday acainst Julian Tregenna
Biddulph Arnold, charging him with em
beselement. There is nothing new in the
complaint, it bHng made, as a matter of
form, to take the place of the old com
plaint, under which Mr. Arnold had been
jield up to the time of Judge de Haven's
decision that Arnold must be tried here
and his pruilt must be established to the
satisfaction of the magistrate before he
can be extradited.
Mr. Arnold is still in charge of United
Ftates Marshal Shine in his hotel at
JJcrkeley. Kvidence for the defense and
the prosecution is on its way from Lon
don, England, and it is expected that Mr.
Arnold's examination before United States
<_'ourt Commissioner Keacoqk will be held
in about ten days.
Patrolman David Murphy Has a
Very Unpleasant Experience
on Kearny Street-
Policeman David Murphy, whose beat
ls on Sutter street, was mistaken for a
horsethief on Kearny street last night.
The case of mistaken identity grew out
of the recent accusation of larceny made
against Policeman Calnan of the Mission
district.
Murphy found a stray quadruped
hitched to a waRon on Sutter street
shortly after 9 o'clock. The driver had
evidently forgotten his responsibility to
the animal while sipping wine in some re
freshment station and the horse formu
lated a plan of letting him walk home.
Murphy could not locate the owner and,
climbing into the wagon, started for the
stable on Webb street, where all good,
friendless horses go.
The usual Saturday night throng was
on Kearny street, and when the officer
drove by he received the "ha, ha."
"I thought they could not lind Calnan,"
said one man, whereupon another re
marked: "It's funny r~ is going in that
direction; there are no pastures out that
way. Hey! old man, back up."
"Maybe he's, going to pawn the brute;
he could draw down enough to go on his
vacation," Was the reply.
Murphy says that if ever he has occa
sion to drive a lost horse again, he hopes
it will be on the Farallon Islands just be
fore daybreak instead of along Kearny
street on Saturday night.
Timothy C. Calnan, the policeman
charged with being a horse thief, is a
fugitive from justice and a bench warrant
is out lor his arrest. Captain Seymour
has detailed several detectives to search
for Calnan, but it is supposed that he has
either left the city or committed suicide.
Friday night the policeman was released
on $2000 bonds, the sureties being Daniel
Hartnett, saloon-keeper, 224 McAllister
street, who qualified on a house and lot
on Geary street, between Scott and Dev
isadero, valued at $15,000, and William
Oibbins, who qualified on eighty acres of
land in Eel Kiver Valley, Humboldt
County, valued at $1G,OOO.
When the case charging the disgraced
patrolman with grand larceny for stealing
A. J. McMillan's horse on April 21 was
called in Judge Conlan's court yesterday
Calnan failed to make his appearance.
Before court was adjourned his name was
again called, but there was no appearance
and the Judge ordered the bench warrant
issued tor his arrest. The bonds were not
declared forfeited, the Judga reserving his
decision on that point till to-morrow.
Two more warrants were issued for Cal
nan's arrest yesterday. One was sworn to
by A. S. Treadwdl. a trainer lor Gvorge
H. Bayiey, charging Calnan with grand
larcenv for stealing a horse from Bayley's
Btables. K23 Market street, on the night
of June 14, and the other was sworn to by
J. T. Lastutka, 1222 Market street, charg
ing him with grand larceny for stealing
a set of harness from his store. It is
probable that \V. K. Shaw, blacksmith,
iG21 Market street, will also swear to a
warrant charging Calnan with stealing a
set of buggy wheels.
When calnan was released from the
City Prison Fridav night he had promised
to call and see his brother-in-law, Joseph
King, of the New Western Hotel, but he
failed to keep his promise. He did not go
to his home at 1*31 Sanchez street, and no
trace of him has been found since he left
the prison. King told Captain Seymour
ytsterday that he was afraid Calnan had
thrown himself into the bay.
Calnan's case is similar to that of Cas
sius Blackman, whose beat was on Valen
cia street, and who on December 14, 1SÂ£Â£,
was arrested on a charge of grand lar
ceny for being implicated in relieving
Timothy Cronin, an old section boss on
the Southern Pacific, of his money in a
saloon on his beat. Blackman was re
leased on $2000 bonds and disappeared.
Nothing lias since been heard of him.
In addition to stealing horses and rob
bing barns Calnan is accused of hav
ing on the night of January 1 broken
into a grocery store conducted by Stelling
Brcs. at Sixteenth and Noe- streets.
Among the articles taken were two demi
johns of liquor, which were discovered
by Detective Fitzgerald hidden in the
basement. Calnan reported the burglary
to CapTain GUlin, who detailed two of his
men to make an investigation. They visit
ed the shop, but after a thorough exam
ination failed to get a clew through which
they might discover the perpetrators of
the crime. Calnan apparently showed trie
deepest interest in apprehending the burg
lars and volunteered his services in run
ning them to earth.
Yesterday Detective Fitzgerald paid an
other visit to Calnan's house, and buried
in the bain found the two demijohns that
had bpen stolen from the grocery. Last
night the Stelling brothers visited the po
lice headquarters and positively identified
the demijohns as their property.
Captain Seymour is satisfied* that Cal
nan did not work alone and he is endeav
crins: to locate his accomplice.
Since his thieving propensities have
come to light Calnan's brother officers tell
of several thefts that have been perpe
trated in and about the Seventeenth-street
station. Coats, trousers, clubs, bridles,
spurs and other articles have been taken.
They suspect Calnan of the thefts.

changed her name, though not for

it Is now her desire to carve out a name
that her own effort alone shall render

Mile. Trebelli will be known as Mile. Do
