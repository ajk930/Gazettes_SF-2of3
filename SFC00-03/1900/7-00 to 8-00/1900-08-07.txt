This appears to confirm the statement that the Chinese will endeavor to stop the march to
Peking by using the Ministers as hostages.
The Lokal Anzeigcr of Berlin, publishing an interview with Li Hung Chang, quotes him
as declaring emphatically that China must not, in any circumstances, cede any more territory to*
any power. In reply to a question why the rebellion was not put down, Earl : Li is represented as
having said: "I blame Prince Tuan, the Empress Dowager and the whole Peking Government.
But for their lack of energetic action the situation would never have become co serious."
The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Daily Mail says: "Active negotiations are proceed

Thee considerations make the authorities hfire deeply gratified at the an
nouncement that the Chinese retreated. This statement means that the allied
troops have occupied Peitsang and are preparing to continue- their advance on '
the' capital. According to military experts here it will never do to permit the
Chjnfse to recover from the effects of the drubbing they nave received. They
must be pursued relentlessly so that if they have not already constructed a
second line of defenses they will not have time to do so before the allies nre
again at their heels. At Peitsang the Chinese, according to Admiral Remey. "
had. ns developed !>â¢â¢ Japanese reeonm-Jssaneo. constructed :reneh*s and had
loop-holed houses. Those defenses, which the allies wore compelled to storm. Â¦
were undoubtedly the cause of the large number of casualties tho assailants -

Future Policy Regarding China

Communication Is Opened.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
CAT..L. BUREAU, WELLIXGTOX HOTEL. WASHINGTON^ Aug. 6.â Future
events in China may depend largely on whether the Chinese were badly beat
en by the International troops In Sunday's battle. Members of the Cabinet
regard, the recent imperial edict as the beginning of a backdown by tho
authorities at Pekinjc and believe that if followed by an overwhelming de
feat of the Chinese there will be still further surrender and tjie Ministers will be
allov.ed to communicate with their Governments without restriction. No details
of the fighting beyond these contained In the dispatches from Rear Admiral
Remey and Commander Taussig have been received, but the statement in the
latter's dispatch that the Chinese were retreating gives ground for the hope
that the battle ended In a rout of the enemy and that the International forces
were able to follow up their advantage and Inflict severe punishment on them.
"If the Chinese Government opens communication with the Ministers." said
a high official, "then everything will depend upon what they communicate. They
, know what has been going on In Peking and what the present conditions there
arc. We do not. and we are not In a position to say what course the powers
will pursue after they have been put in communication with their diplomatic
, representatives. We cannot negotiate without having connections with our
representatives in the capital of the country with which we are negotiating, and
they must have freedom of action and of communication with the Government of
that country." . ! ...
* . So many different versions of the latest imperial edict have come from China
that the authorities here have no means of knowing what its exact terms are.
They have no doubt, however, that it made some concessions In the matter of
communication, although it did not go so far . as to allow the transmission of
cipher dispatches. Concessions of the right to send plain messages which could
be read by Chinese at will and changed would not be of much value.
â¢ No communication In the nature of an ultimatum has been or will be sent
to China by this Government. The American policy has not varied from that laid
down-In- the note of July 3 to the powers. "War on China is not desired by this
Government, but if the other powers should declare war the United States -would
probably be drawn in with them. The United . States Is co-operating in military
operations to accomplish specific results. If at any point the events so shape,
themselves that these operations can give way to diplomacy this Government
will be glad to negotiate. Another reason for not going to extremes with China
is that the administration has a knfcwtedge that there are prominent officials in
Peking and elsewhere in China who recognize the fact that the imperial Govern
ment has made a great mistake. As long as there is hot a formal state of war
â¢these men can be relied upon to use their influence, so far as it is safe for them
to do so. in opposition to the anti-foreign element now in control. A declaration
of wax or the delivery of an ultimatum would probably unify China and make the
task of the powers very difficult. - . '//. i- : .

TIA/O CABLEGRAMS THAT CONTAIN THE NEWS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. â The following cablegrams were received at the Navy Depart

from the rear admiral in charge of the Asiatic station :
LATEST NEWS OF SUNDAY'S BATTLE.
Copyriglit, -Â£Oo, by the Associater*. Press.
After seven hours' hard fighting and with loss of 1200 killed and wounded, the allied
forces in China on Sunday drove the Chinese from a strong position at Peitsang, a town
some eleven miles beyond Tientsin, on the road to Peking. Though details further than those
contained in brief messages from Admiral Remey and Commander Taussig are still lacking,
a recent reconnoissance showed that Peitsang was held in force by the Chinese, who had dug
trenches and loopholed the walls of the mud huts, of which the village is^mainly composed. A
marsh protected the enemy's right. Sixteen thousand is given by Admiral Remey' as the
strength of the allies, and the casualties reported consequently amount to between 7 and 8
per cent of the force engaged. This a higher percentage than General Buller lost in the dis
astrous attempt to force the Tugela at Colenso.
Li Hung Chang is reported to have informed the foreign Consuls that the envoys had left
Peking on August 3 for Tientsin. Little or no credence is olaced in the report.
A London dispatch speaks of the possibility of the Chinese Viceroys -of the southern
provinces throwing off their allegiance to the Manchu dynasty if assured of foreign support.

The long westbound overland passenger

the locomotive left the track. Engineer
Brown instantly applied the air brakes
and then clung to the throttle a9 the pon
derous machine, swaying and trembling,
plowed its way over the ties within a few
feet of the edge of the deep chasm. Six
teen car lengths the locomotive ran and
then the engineer got it under control.
Fireman -William Mclntyre had jumped,
and he rolled down the embankment,
being severely but not dangerously hurt.
The train was made up of thirteen cars,
none of which left the track, and no pas
sengers were injured. Many of the pas-'
sengers went forward and thanked En
gineer Brown for so plucklly staying by
his engine. His coolness and judgment
averted a terrible accident, for had he
left the engine it Is probable the train
would have gone over the embankment,
thus causing frightful loss of life.

whose San Francisco .poolroom case
proved a recent decision, in the finishing
blow to the operators of those places,
handed down his decision here to-day In a
big water suitâ the Kern County Land
Company against Miller and Lux. The
case went against the latter.
The decision fa of great interest to the
city of Bakersfield, inasmuch as it does
away with Panama Slough, which winds
its filthy course through the main part of
the city. It has been a great nuisance
and menace to the public health. Here
tofore it has not been possible for the
city to do away with this run. owing to
the legal obstacle in the way that it
was a waterway. Judge Shaw's decision
that it is not a waterway will now make
the way clear to do away with the nui
$ Miller and Lux contended that they and
a few others were entitled to S00 cubic
feet of water and should be allowed to
receive it through Panama Slough. Judge
Shaw's decree allows them nine and a
half cubic feet, and.it must be delivered
to them through the Famer's Canal.
The decree sets cut that Panama Slough
has not been a natural waterway for thir
ty years. It is understood that this de
cision wilt settle the controversy and that
there will be no appeal to a higher court.
This case was heard some time ago and
occupied the attention of the court for
several, weeks. There were over 400.OC0
words in the testimony. The peonlo of
Bakersfleld are much pleased at Shaw's
decision. In all probability the city will
use the old sloughbed to lay a main for
the sewer system planned.

were told that ro person present had the
slightest idea of the case. Brlggs, tho
druggist.- said that some person had â¢re
quested him to inform the Coroner that a
case awaited him. Who that person waa
he could not remember. AH the physi
cians had left the pl?ee and not a single
word of information had been left
No record of the girl's history could be
produced, although prominent physicians
in the place stated later that it is custo
mary for each patient to leave his or her
name in the drug store before entering
for treatment.
Officer Flynn notified Captain Seymour
of the case and he at once detailed Detec
tive Crockett on it. The detective could
not obtain any more information than
any one else. A number of physicians
connected, with the clinic disclaimed all
knowledge of the case, and not even the
names of the persons who were to have
performed the operation could be ob
tained.
The Coroner's deputies and the detec
tives who were detailed on the case were
baffled when they found the body alone
in the room. Several bruises on it. still
unexplained, served only to deepen the
mystery.
A death to which much mystery clings
was reported to the Morgue officials last
evening. A young woman died on an
operating table at the New Montgomery
street Clinic, a branch of the medical de
partment of the University of California,
before an operation had been commenced.
Who she was nobody knows. It is said
that she came to her death while being
placed under the influence of chloroform,
but the names of the persons who .vere
present when she breathed her last Iiave
not been revealed.

Chinese southwest of Tientsin and another large force in the

WASHINGTON. July G.â The an

Rear Admiral Remey and Com
mander Tau?5ig of reported

the Chinese situation. Little doubt was
expressed at the Navy Department that
the news was substantially correct. It

tner.t. who have been exceedingly reticent
for several days as to news from the seat
of war admitted to-day when the naval
di<=patchÂ«-s were received that the an
nouncement of the battle was not unex
pected. Opiniett among the various offi
cials now in Washington is somewhat
.livided as t" just what is presaged by to

i-clined to think that such a severe blow
as the Chinese must have received at
FVitssr.K Win result in the speedy disir.ter
pration of the forces now opposing the

Beginning of KÂ«sistance. ;
In lir.e with this prediction, it was pro-<{
pbecied that the Chinese Government
would find means to send the Ministers
from Peking under escort and thus stave
off the advance upor. the capital. On the
Â£ther hand, a number of officers in a posi
tion to judge equally well held that the
fight at 'peitsang was only the beginning
nf a strenuous resistance that would be
continued to the gates of Peking or be
yond. It was urped in support of this
view that the Chinese had a hundred men
to lose against one of the allies; that they
Â¦were well armed with modern guns and
had apparently an abundance of am
munition.
It is stated liat much apprehension ex
ists among those conversant with Oriental
affairs at the reappearance in Peking

fanatic, Li Ping Heng. It is understood j
? hat his appearance in Peking affairs may
have had something to do with the Shang
hai rumors of Li Hung Chang's suicide.
It is certain that with Li Ping Her.g and
Prince Tuan in control of the de facto
Government in China a religious war of i
dervish-like fanaticism probably will be
waged against all foreigners, and friends
of the more liberal Chinese statesmen are
exceedingly anxious as to their fate under
the Tuan-Li Pirg Herg regime.
Heavy Guns for China.
The War Department is in receipt of a
Uspattch from General MacArthur an
louncing that he has supplied additional
artillery supplies for Taku for use in the
"hinese campaign. These supplies include
several Gathng euns and the remainder of
the howitzer siege train from Manila,
which up to date has remained useless in
the Philippines on account of the bad
roads.
How much better General Chaffee may
be able to handle these monster guns

recent dispatch contained an urgent ap

it. The experts at the War Department

Peking these Qve-fseb rifles and seven

SCARCITY OF CANNED
IHFATS IN GERMANY
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â The provi
sioning of Germany's naval forces for the
China campaign has been greatly inter
fered with by the scarcity of canned
m^ats in the empire, according to a re
port to the State Department from United
States Consul Pit cairn at Hamburg. The
naval authorities at Kiel, he says, are
torr.pelled to buy canned meats at a high
price in foreign countries because of the
inability of Germany to supply home de
mands. Consul Pitcairn transmits an
article published in a Denmark news
paper teliing of an order for 30,000 pounds
nf sausage placed by the German Govern
ment for use on the Chinese squadron.
He also sends an article published in a
Hamburg newspaper, giving. further evi
dence of the straits to which Germany is
brought in supplying- her ships' crews
bound for Chinese waters with meat.
American canned moats, the latter article
says, have been largely used In supply
ing the German navy. The army, it adds,
is supplied by two large meat houses at
Spandau and Mainz and there is an
urgent necessity for creating new plants
and extending the old ones to such a de
gree, that the provisioning of both the
army and navy can be accomplished by
tho home industry alone.

British and other, forces toward Peking,
nor as to the present proposition of the

BERLIN. Aug. S.-The German Foreign
Office announces to-night that it had no

the advance of the allied forces from
Tientsin had begun.
The Lokal Anzeigpr publishes an inter
view which Dr. Zaker. its ppecial China
correspondent, had with IA Hung Chang
at Canton on July 5. Earl LI told the cor
respondent that the Boxers would not
Nrebel and were loyal to the royal house.
This movement, he explained, was direct
ed chiefly against native Christians who'
had been using international protection
to oppress the Boxers.
With reference to the missionaries he
said: "It is my firm conviction that tho
missionaries are always in danger, for ths
relations between the Chinese population I
and foreigners have been the cause of j
nearly all the troubles and -will alway3
continue to be."
Earl LI went on to Fay that Chinese j
hatred of foreigners had been increased !
of late through the action of the powers, j
particulary in the seizure of Kiaochau
which he described as "an exorbitant
penalty for a couple of missionaries."
i Referring to the murder of Baron von
Ketteler. German Minister at Peking, he
gave positive assurance that neither
Prince Tuan nor any other members of
the Government knew of the intended
killing, and he also declared that Baron
von Ketteler was not murdered because
he was a German, but because he was a
foreigner; in a word, he was a victim of
the Chinese hatred of foreigners.
"The Chinese Government is not strong
enough to put down the Boxers," said
Earl Li. "but the thought of accepting as
sistance from the powers to put them
down is extremely repugnant to the Gov
ernment."
In reply to a question as to Â¦who was
at the head of the central government
he said it was administered by Prince
Tuan. in the name of the Emperor.

point they would pick off the foreigners
in. the street below. A Russian officer
and three of his men were 'sniped* in this
way. All died from their wounds.
"One night I was standing at my win
dow, close to which was a big tree. ' Sud
denly I heard two rifle') shots, followed in
stantly by the spattering of bullets on
the window 3hutters. I ran into the hall
and told one of the officers. He made a
hurried Investigation and found a Boxer
up in the tree. At the point of the gun
he was ordered down and the first thing
he asked was If he had killed the Chris
tian in the window (meaning me). He
was given a trial, found guilty and shot.
"Another time I waa standing in front
of a -mirror. I lighted a candle for a
minute, but felt that it was not safe to
keep it burning, so blew it out. No sooner
had I done 'so than the mirror in front of
me was smashed to smithereens. I could
not understand what had happened and
struck a match to. see what the trouble
was. A bullet had struck the glass not

DOCTOR JOINED
FIRST SORTIE
j^R. DIFFENDORFER tells an inter
im/ esting story of his. experience dur-
ing the height. of the Tientsin trou
ble. "Tongue cannot tell nor the mind of
an ordinary American citizen imagine the
state of affairs that now exists in China,"
said the doctor,, yesterday. "I have been
out there a year and a half and through
my connection with Consul Ragsdale got a
good insight into the situation. This out
break is not a thing of the moment. It
has been growing and gathering strength
for months, and the Chinese Government
Is behind it. .There Is no question about
that, i Sentimentalists can say what they
please, but China must be whipped into
line, or else tho foreigners and mission
aries can never hope to make a home
there again.
"The bombardment' of Tientsin began
"When the first Boxer disturbance oc
curred I was within fifty feet of a body
of them. It was on the morning of June
15. We had been awakened from sleep
and told to start for Gordon Hall Imme
diately. The first I know of the danger
was when I heard a chanting sound some
ways up the street. Then in the dim
morning light we could' distinguish a lot
of Boxers slowly making their way to
ward us. They were going through a lot
of movements which is characteristic of
them before they engage In an attack.
They wore gray suits with red sashes and
hats and were swinging red lanterns in
front of them. Only a few had guns,
most of them carrying swords, three of
which had been taken out of their
sheaths. We could see them glisten in
the light of the lanterns.
"We expected, of course, wo would be
captured before reaching Gordon Hall,
and I had taken out my revolver and was
on the point of killing myself when, from
some hidden place, a detachment of Ger
man guards, came between us and the
Boxers. The guards charged upon the
Chinamen and drove them back.
"I remained at the Gordon Hall until
June 23. During the shelling we were In
the cellar and we took our chances be
tween the firing to get outside and eat.
One day I went outside and was turning
the corner of the -building- when a three
lnch shell burst back of me. But I had
Just sot around the side of the building
and so escaped the force of the explo
sion. A piece of the projectile, however,
struck me and I picked it up and have
saved It as a memento.
"After the railroad station and arsenals
had been reduced there was a continuous
rain of bullets and many of the Boxers
managed to get by the allies'. guards and
into the city. They would get on top of
"I stood it Just as long as I could. Then
I turned to a couple of the marines on
the deck and in a voice that could be
heard by everybody around me, said:
" 'Boys, have any of you a cigarette?'
The other women looked on in horror as
1 took a. cigarette from one of the sailors
and calmly began to smoke it. It was
my first, but not my last. I found that
its odor was a great relief from the sick
ening perfumes which rose from the
water and river banks and I kept on
smoking until we reached Taku. All told
I smoked twelve.
"As our boat proceeded we were horri
fied to see heads of Chinamen floating in
the water, while along: the river banks
were dismembered bodies, and in same
places dogs were eating the decayed flesh.
It was the most sickening sight I have
ever witnessed. The . stench from the
bodies was terrible.
"It was while coming down the Peiho
River that I smoked by first cigarette,"
said Miss Fahr in relating her experi
ences to a Call reporter at the Occidental.
"Our boat was the iirst to attempt to
make the trip in three weeks. A num
ber had already lost their lives in making
similar attempts, and we were told that
we were running chances even then.
OF the many thrilling stories related
by the refugees, none exceeeds in in
terest that told by Miss Tillie M.
Fahr of Lincoln City, Indiana, who spent
two years in Tientsin teaching in a pri
vate family. Three times Miss Fahr came
within a hair's breadth of being killed
by the savage Boxers. One of the unus
ual incidents of the young woman's flight
for home was her learning to smoke
cigarettes, an accomplishment which she
makes no pretense of covering up. In
fact she seems to enjoy telling about it.

"As to the allies. The Cossacks are

we would never have got out of Tientsin.

"Dr. Kin, a tine Chinese gentleman, a
graduate of Yale and president of the
military college, was murdered with his
students. He took lunch that day with
Lieutenant Wright of the English ma
rines, who advised him not to go back to
the place. Dr. Kin had sent his family
down the river that morning, but the
Boxers knew them and turned them
back without molesting them. They told
them that they did not want to hurt them,
but that they wanted to get hold of Dr.
Kin because he was a friend of the for
eigners. Dr. Kin knew that his family
had returned and went back to the col
lege and to his death. .

peemed very anxious to reach. The Rus
sians had been fighting steadily at that
point for twelve hours and they were fast
weakening. Meanwhile another 400 made
a desperate attempt to reinforce those
who were fiphting on the plains to the
right. They were driven back, however,
and then they joined those who were de
fending the station. Matters looked so
serioua that it was thought best to get
the ammunition -wagons in readiness. The
horses were hitched and the women and
children were told to be ready at a mo

a retrest was forced. The plan was to
pet us out bv way of Taku. In the event
of this plan" being frustrated there were
ten bluejackets who volunteered to shoot
us rather than let us fall Into the hands
of the Chinese.
"But just at the most critical moment
3X1 bluejackets charged ahead of the Rus
sians, the latter following closely. The
Boxers evidently thought reinforcements
had arrived and they retreated like a
pack of wild geese.
"But I almost forgot to tell you about
our heroâ the real hero of Tientsin, and
everybody should rise when his name is
spoken. It was 'Jim' Watts who really
saved us. To him the women and chil

/_j the two oh!l(]rer. cf J. W. Ragsdale.
Â¦^ United States Consul at Tientsin.
Few young folks have experienced so
much adventure as have Master Earl and
Miss Effle Ragsdale. T!;ey are 17 and 13
years of age respectively. They spent two
knd a half years in Tientsin and both
ltr.ow the country like a book. Santa Rosa
Is their home and they started for there
yesterday afternoon. With them on the
transport were Mrs. E. B. Drew and chil
dren. Mrs. Drew is the wife of the com
missioner of customs at Tientsin. Their
destination is Boston.
Miss Ragsdale could not say enough in
praise of the United States Government
for taking such gt>od care of herself and
brother and in fact of all foreigners in
China of whatever nationality.
Uncle Sam's men, she said, seemed to
tr.ke care of everybody who needed as
rlstance. The commar..ders of the other
foreign transports appeared to have lost
their heads and oftentimes their own
countrymen were refused assistance or
protection. These always* found a -warm
â¢welcome from the Americans and It seem
ed ag if there was nothing that the United
Etates officers would not do for those In
distress.
"On June 14." Miss Ragsdale said. "the
Boxers destroyed two large churches
built by the missionaries. That was the
first serious act of the Boxers, although
for several months prior there had been
desultory firing going on.
"On June 15 we were ordered to leave
our house and go to Gordon Hall. When
we- got there we found it locked. We were
oblioged to return home, but the next time
we went we had no trouble getting into
the halL
"That was on ths 17th. On the
following day the Boxers began to shell
the city with a vengeance.
*'A big Fhell exploded in the dlnlng
r.-iom. where several people were eating,
and a Cmnese man and wife were killed.
The shells wore flying bo thick that we
had to po down Into the cellar under the
tower. In an hour and a half forty shells
were firod at the hall by the Boxers.
"There wore 200 of us in the cellar and
we were a pretty frightened lot I can tell
you. Babies and little children were cry
ing and distracted mothers walked the
floor and prayed for deliverance. The
men wore all outside participating in the
tiefer.se. At night our family, with four
others, slept ou the hall stajreâ that Is,
what sleep we could get, which wasn't
much.
"One afternoon I went out to carry
6ime of the men coffee and sandwiches.
The bullets were flyinp: aJl around me
and one big shell landed only thirty feet
away. My leg was injured by the explo
sion.
"The situation was the worst on the
ISth. and most of us expected to â¢ die.
Tliere were 400 Russians protecting the
J/TflTH a crowd of men, women and children â refu
y r S ccs from Tientsin â on her poop deck the United
States army transport Logan steamed in through the
Golden Gate early yesterday morning. She went at once into
quarantine and zvas released at p a. in., docking an hour later.
During all of the long wait not a passenger left the main deck
and many a heartfelt "thank God'' was uttered when the
steamer zvas alongside and all hands were allozvcd ashore.
Thrilling arc the talcs of the refugees in describing their
hairbreadth escapes from death and from wholesale slaughter
at the hands of the bloodthirsty Chinese Boxers while cooped
up in Tientsin praying for the arrival of the relief force from
Taku.
Around Tientsin occurred the first great struggle in the
baffle for supremacy between the Asiatic hordes and the sol
diers representing the Western powers. On that occasion,
thanks to the valor of the American, British, Russian and Jap
anese forces, the Mongolians zverc driven back zvith great
slaughter, and Tientsin was rclirjcd. Once the allied forces
were in possession of the tozan there zcas a general exodus of
the people who had been imprisoned there. Some of them came
to San Francisco, others zvent to Europe, a few are making
their homes in Japan temporarily, but all zvho could leave Chi
nese territory did so.
Many of the refugees zvent to Taku, China, and from
there took passage for the United States. They got as far as
Nagasaki, Japan, and there zverc compelled to wait for trans
portation to San Francisco. The Warren, from Manila, came
along, but she zvas crowded with soldiers who had been inva
lided home front the Philippines, so the refugees had to possess
their souls in patience.
Six days after the departure of the Warren the Logan put
in an appearance. She had been to Taku, from Manila, zvith
the Ninth Infantry, and having landed the troops zvas on her
way back to San Francisco. On her zvay here she stopped at
Yokohama, and had barely cleared that port when a cable or
dering her back to China reached the United States Consul.
She came home by zvay of the Great Circle, but zvas consider
ably delayed by five days of fog.
Besides the forty-two refugees from Tientsin the Logan
brought home sixteen invalided marines and sailors, sixty-one
sick men from the Ninth Infantry and four prisoners. The
soldiers of the Ninth zi'crc taken sick while en route from Ma
nila to Taku, and had to be sent home.
Quite a number of people joined the Logan at Taku, but
ov.lv zvent as far as Yokohama on her. Among them were:
Captain McCalla and servant, Mr. and Mrs. Garley and child,
Miss Fabris, Miss Wilson. Miss Glover. Miss Croucher, E. G.
Adams. Mrs. Forbes, G. S. Knowlcs, Mrs. Dctring, child and
nurse; Miss Dctring. Miss D. Detn'ng and Miss E. Dctring.
Mrs. McCalla and Miss McCalla, the wife and daughter of
Captain. McCalla, joined the Logan at Nagasaki.
Among those zvho came here direct from the scat of war
was Dr. R. E. Diffcndorfer. He is in charge of Effic and Earl
Ragsdcle, son and daughter of the American Consul at Tien
tsin. Dr. Dittendorfer zvas formerly a dentist in Santa Rosa,
but zvent to China some years ago and established a zvoolcn mill
there. Everything he ozvncd in the Flowery Kingdom is now
in ruins, so he decided to come home and await better times.

Ing the position against the attacking
party. They had loopholed the building
by removing the bricks and it was neces
sary that they should be kept posted on
the movements of the enemy so as to be
prepared for the charges.
"We had signaled to them from the
tower," said .Mclntosh yesterday, "and
arranged to let them know exactly where
the Chinese were.
"I think we spent about fifteen days
In that tower and did some execution. I
was engineer in charge and three times
we tried to run engines out of the DÂ«
leaguered town, but each time we were
driven back. Everywhere we saw the
bodies of headless Chinese. The Boxers
had got in their deadly work. They dr>
not know what fear is and now that they
are beginning to usq the Mauser rifles
they prove to be foes of no mean cali
ber."
RUSSIANS ARE
VERY BRUTAL
/%T is a complicated situation In China
at the present time," said J. Fred
Hayner, Methodist missionary to the
land of the Yellow Dragon, at the Occi
dental yesterday evening. "I came out on
the last train from Tientsin and we all
had a narrow escape. This trouble has
been brewing for a long time, and there
have been warnings of the outbreak, but
they were not heeded. The result la
slaughter and the probability of the mur
der of all the foreigners in the country.
"When the trouble developed at Tien
tsin I locked up my family in the cellar
of my house and went forth to assist In
keeping the Chinese at bay. We were
bombarded two weeks and my house was
struck nine times by shells. However,
we all escaped without injury, for which
we thank the Lord.
"There are so many features of the sit
uation down there that it is difficult to
make any concise and comprehensive
statement regarding it. Americans are
the most popular people In China, both
among the foreigners and the natives.
Admiral KempfT la highly praised for re
fusing to sign the joint demand of the
powers for the surrender of the Taku
forts. It is a fact that there were no
shots fired at Admiral Seymour until the
Taku forts were fired upon. The Rus
sians were responsible for the clash, and
they excused themselves by declaring
that there was an enormous Chinese
army advancing and that there was no
alternative but to fight. As a matter of
fact, there was no such information re
ceived, and the brutality of the minions
of the Czar was astonishing in these days
of supposed civilization.
"When the commander and his staff in
the forts of Taku found it necessary to
surrender, they walked out and offered
their swords. Instead of being treated as
civilized beings they were shot down by
the Russians like a lot of dogs, and no
official prisoners were taken. When the
town was captured, the Russians were
among the chief looters, and in their oper
ations In the outskirts they perpetrated
some excessive barbarities. To my knowl
edge, in one village, the women and chil
dren were driven into the river and then
when there was no escape they were shot
to death and their bodies allowed to float
away.
"There Is no denying the fact that tho
Americans are the most prominent in tho
complications. They were in the advance
and on the firing line all the time, and
they were the greatest sufferers in the
matter of casualties.

EUREKA, Cal.. Aug. 6.â The report of
an oil strike Saturday In Mattole fields
: Is somewhat premature, though Indica
: tions are that the flow in the Mclntosh

Fresno oil man, who came from the well
late Saturday night, says that at a depth
of 1200 feel the drill struck a third stratum

below the third stratum the outlook for
a flow is good. Excitement here con

son. But instead of doing this Governor
Gage took the noon train for the East.
Governor Gage's attitude with respect to
the Sacramento Judgeship is inexplicable
In Republican circles here and much dis
appointment ia expressed. Sacramento
had a prior claim to San Diego County for
consideration at the hands of the execu
tive. Letters have been on file in the of
fice of the executive for weeks from tne
two Judges now on the bench, urging the
appointment of the third Judge to fill the
vacancy caused by Judge Johnson's
death, on the ground that the business of
the courts had accumulated to such an
extent as to require the services of Sacra
mento's full quota of I Superior Judges.
Governor Gage, however, has paid no at
tention to these and other urgent re
quests. Local Republicans claim that
Governor Gage Is rarely at his office In
the Capitol at all and that the oppor
tunity seldom. If ever. Is offered citizens
to confer, with him freely on the needs of
the taxpayers in this part of the county.
It is pointed out that the place for the
Governor to transact office business is the
State Capitol and that he should be at all
times accessible, the same as any other
public officer.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. CâThe^announce
ment of the appointment of Judge George
Fuller to the position made vacant by the
death of Judge J. W. Hughes did not
come as a surprise to the people of San
Diego for the reason that the appoint
ment was expected and Mr. Fuller's name
had been mentioned first in the list of
possibilities ever since the vacancy had
been created by death. Judge Fuller has
alreadj received two or three minor ap
pointments from the Governor, being a
member of the Normal School -Board and
the attorney for the Harbor Commission
ers. He has been a practitioner here for
about fourteen years, most' of the time

Speclnl Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO. Cal.. Aug. 6.â Murderer King
still remains at liberty, but closely hem
med in by a posse of twenty-five men. It
would appear that his hours of freedom
are numbered. Sheriff Taylor sent in two
deputies to-day from the scene of action
with instructions to his numerous sen
tinels stationed along the timber lines
that would likely afford King an avenue
of escape.
In an interview with Deputy Sheriff
Redwine, fresh from the scene of the
manhunt, The Call's correspondent glean
ed the latest movements of the armed
forces under the leadership of Sheriff
Taylor.
Redwine stated that yesterday after
noon two of tha scouting party found in
a lonely spot in the wildest recesses of
the dense forest a glowing camp fire with
a frying pan on the coals. The evidence
of disorder about the camp showed that
hurried preparations had been made for
a hasty retreat. The location of the camp
was such that the fugitives, on leaving,
were sure to come between the two pur
suing posses. Immediately the two scouts
withdrew to the main trail and reported
their find to Sheriff Taylor, who In turn
ordered his armed forces to push forward
and Just at dusk they sighted an old
abandoned log cabin, with smoke Issuing
from the chimney. Taylor. Peterson.
Watson and O'Neal surrounded the cabin
and the remaining four men took po
sitions about a hundred yards from the
cabin, so as to command the place. Whit
ney was above the cabin, Redwine near
the ravine. Mason commanded the ravine
in one direction and Morgan in the other.
Redwine and Mason had rifles and the
others had guns loaded with buckshot.
After they had. waited a few minutes
some one appeared at the door of the
cabin with an ax. evidently intending to
chop wood. When about seven feet from
the cabin Peterson called upon the man
to throw up his arms. The latter sprang
into the brush like a flash. Peterson fired
twice into the thicket after the fleeing
man, while the rest of the posse closed
in upon the cabin, finding a rifle and an
assortment of scanty food. It being
dark, no one could accurately describe the
man, so they do not know whether it was
tho halfbeed guide or King whom they
fired at. It is believed the other man
must have been outside staking horses
out. All traces of the fugitives were lost
by the pursuing party on account of dark
. No news has been received from the
other posse. The direction taken by the
fugitives leads into the other pursuing
party's lines. It was so late and the pur
suers, who had been at work fully twen
ty-four hours without an hour's sleep or
respite, were so worn out that orders
were given to make camp.
Saturday the fugitives secured provis
ions from a rancher named Bushnell on
Mad River. Bushnell was ignorant of
their identity, but his description of the
white man answers that of King.
Information from Laytonvllle reports
that Deputy Sheriff Grubbs' posse is re
turning home, having given up the chase,
believing that Sheriff Taylor had his man
well Burrounded. News is momentarily
expected from Taylor's posse.

Special Dispatch to The Call. . -
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 0.â
The prospects for Utanford athletics for
the coming year are growing brighter and
brighter aa the time draws near for the
opening of the university. It is at last
known for a certainty that Frank L.
Slaker, the famous fullback on the Uni
versity of Chicago eleven for two seasons,
will come West and enter Stanford next
September. It was his desire to do so
last year, but he was held back by the
persuasions of his friends, and he did
brilliant work in the field for Chicago last
fall. He is drawn to Stanford by the many
attractions of the place and especially'by
the superior advantages offered by the
engineering department. Slaker first
played football with the "West Aurora, 111.,
High School team in 1S93. In 1S9S he
entered the University of 'Chicago. He
has received many flattering attentions In
the columns of the Eastern papers. He
plays with great dash. In the great 17
to 0 Chicago-Madison game for the West
ern championship, December 9, 1S99,
Slaker made seven-eighths of the gains
for Chicago. Slaker was generally the
Star of the Chicago 'Varsity in all its
games. Slaker's skill and experience will
do much in helping Stanford recuperate
its former fortunes. His presence on the
football field will lend Inspiration and con
fidence to all. Slaker is 23 years old, he
is 6 feet 8% inches In height and weighs
180 pounds.

COAST NEWS IN BRIEF.
FIND RICH PLACERS
NEAR COPPER RIVER
w yANCOUVER. B. C. Aug. 6.â An armed patrol tug with a searchlight and
1^ / other modern war fixtures has been ordered into service by the Provincial
W Government at the request of Canadian salmon canners and fishermen to
T guard against invasion and depredation by American fishermen.
Last week over J7000 worth of salmon nets were destroyed or stolen.
Members of the White Fishermen's Union were accused, and in order to clear
themselves the latter sent out a dozen natrol boats on Sunday night to catch tht*
perpetrators of the net cutting, If possible. They found that white men as well
as Japanese were the sufferers, which showed that nets were not being destroyed
simply out of a spirit of revenge ngainst the Japanese for deserting the white
fishermen in the recent strike.
Sunday night information was pained that at least, in several cases, Ameri
can fishermen from Puget Sound had come over from around Point Roberts,
which marks the boundary line and, had looted several nets from the Canadian
boats. In one instance two American boats came over early on Saturday and
their occupants secured two nets late on Saturday night. The Japanese boats
have nets usually about eighty fathoms long and four of these were cut by the
Americans. Then they put the halves together and made two nets as good as
new. â¢ '^' ! V
Under the present arrangements It would take a thousand small patrol boats
to efficiently protect the fishing fleet. Thp fishermen pointed out in their re
quest to the Government that the province had been willing to send military pro
tection for the canners, and they considered the necessity urgent for the send
ing of a patrol steamer. This boat i.s now being fitted out from Victoria. Ac
cording to a promise made by the Government this afternoon it will have twenty
armed officers on board and its searchlight is especially intended for watching
the shores around Point Roberts to protect the fleet from the American poachers
that are alleged to come ih that way.
The run of salmon to-day was much better than it has been yet this season.
As high as sixty and seventy fish were being taken to a boat and to-night fish
in large numbers were reported to be coming up the gulf from the southward.

SAN JOSE. Aug. 6.â The San Jose Tele
phone Company, which was recently or
ganized here, objects to the restrictions
provided in a franchise applied for some
time ago. The Council wants all the wires
in the business section put underground.
At the Council meeting this morning Man
ager Ammen denounced this provision as
unjust discrimination against the ne*.v
company, as the Sunset Company is al
lowed to string Its wires wherever It
pleases. He intimated that unless *.-!s
company was granted a franchise on the
fame conditions as rranted the Sunset
suit would be commenced to compel the
city to do so. A new demand for a fran
chise similar to the other was filed, which
closes ivith the following paragraph:
The undersigned ha? repeatedly addressed
your Honorable body and informed you that
It was not desirous of causing expense to the
city of Kan Jose, or to the citizens thereof, and
hereby warns you that it will tolerate no more
Jucgllnz or delay.
Ammen and his company declare that
the Sunset Company Is endeavoring to
block their request for a franchise.
FIGHTING THE MONOPOLY.
Santa Cruz Supervisors in Conflict
With Sunset Telephone Company.
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 6.â The Sunset Tel
ephone Company has obtained a tempor
ary restraining order from the United
States Circuit Court to prevent the Super
visors from carrying out the order re
moving the poles and wires of the com
pany from the county road. The matter
will be heard in court August 10.
The Supervisors first sent a notice to
the telephone company regaruing its ap
plication for a franchise. No attention
was paid to this. Later the Supervisors
ordered that the poles and wires be re- :
moved from 'the county road in thirty
days from the date, and if the order was
not complied with the Supervisors would
enforce the order themselves. As the Su
pervisors meant business, the telephone
company had a restraining order issued.
The company erected the lines on the
county roads without a franchise. The
county pays $45 a month for telephone
service. Under the franchise proposed to
be given it was provided that the county
should receive telephone service gratis.
The Supervisors propose to carry the mat
ter to a finish.

f> T the special Invitation of the PrfÂ«

vicinity the Rev. XV. C. Chalfant,
the Presbyterian missionary v.ho return
ed frcn tie Orifnt last month, addrossed
th<~rn In the room? of the Presbyterian
Mission yesterday moniirir. A Large aud-
Jen: e greeted the reverend gentleman
when he was introduced by the presijent
of the body. Dr. Chalfant is a ready talk
er, and his description of thft people and
the customs of the Chinese empire
j^rove-i highly interesting. He illustrated
his talk with maps, which he readily
crew on the blackboard and his auditors
Â»-ere able to follow him without any
tnwjfcle.
At the outset of hi? addresi he dwelt on
the development of the Boxer movement.
He paid its inception was due to the as-
Eressfre movement of the Germans. He
said hr- did not doubt that the missiona
ry s v.ere rrsponslble for the entire tr<>u
t>\f. because they were endeavoring
to impress Â«^hristian Sdeps and the ideas
nf wrptern civilization on the Chinese. He
d'd not doubt that this movement, which
resulted in ruch intense hostility to for
*"!rners. lod the Hmpress Down per to im
prison the younr Emperor: that it also
resulted in bringing toprothcr the con
servative and the liberal forces of the
Chinese empire and developed into the
oppression of the foreigners.
The Rev. Mr. r*halfant said that he
thought nothine less than a powerfully
npfrrrsive movement on the part of all the
powers, which would result Jn something
decisive, would bring ouiet and peace to
the troubled empire. It was his opinion
that this oould only be broupht about by
the destruction of the city of Pekinp or
the moving: of the cap'tal to some other
part of the empire. Such a course, he
said, would be sufficient to Impress the
<'hinf>se as a mass with the real fact that
the powers had won a victory.
At the close of the Rev. Mr. Chalfanfs
talk he answered questions
put to him by his auditors and a general
discussion of* the Boxers followed.
In the afternoon Dr. Chalfant. Dr.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. August 6.â Fred Himes. the 13-year-old poisoner of his fathÂ«r.
tearfully repents of his deed now that he realizes the enormity of his
offense. But it is not pity for the dying father that makes his penitent-
It is the fear that he will be kept In jail or a reformatory. The boy Is
morally perverted.
\W. M. Himes, the father, is still alive, but there is little change In his con
dition. D,r. Davidson says he may hold out for several days yet, but has no
hope for his'recovery. The arsenic has eaten up the tissues of the intestines
and paralyzed the muscles of the body. The patient is delirious most of the
time.
Frankie Himes, the 9-year-old son, who was in the plot and helped to buy thÂ«
poison, is In Jail. Sheriff Collins let his uncle take him away, but It Is under
stood that the latter brought him back. Fred Martin, the other accomplice, has
not vet been arrested.
The Call's correspondent had an Interview with Frederick Himes at the Jail
to-day. He asked how his father was getting along and was told that the
latter's condition was critical.
"Hope he gets well." sobbed the boy. "Because If he doesn't they'll keep
me In Jail." r
"Didn't you know the poison wpuld kill your father?" was asked.
Â¦ "I never thought about that at all." replied the boy.
Fred said he had always been the black sheep of the "family. His father was
in Alaska when he was born and did not return until he was two years old.
Himes took a dislike to him from the start and always abused him, the boy says!
While Himes was delirious from th? effects of the poison in his little cottage
on G street, his only attendant was the boy who had poisoned him. When
one of the neighbors visited the house he found every window and door of the
room where the patient was confined closed, with the thermometer ranging from
106 to 110 degrees in the shade. The Interior of the room was almost suffocating
and the boy was told to keep the windows and doors open. As soon as the
visitor's back was turned, however, he closed the room up again.
tlon of J. W. Maze on the charge of kill
ing W. M. Dempsey was held here to
day and Maze was bound over for trial

Special Dispatch to Tfoe Call.
BLOOMINGTOX. 111., Aug. 6.â J. Olln
ger of Denver, Colo., Is in the County
Jail here In a demented condition, caused
by excitement and fright in the hold-up
by robbers on the Union Pacific near
Hugo. Colo., Saturday night, in which \V.
J. Fay of Anaheim, Cal., was killed. Olln
ger is a Denver undertaker and was for
merly a barber In- Bloomlngton. He had
not been here for llfteen years and was
coming on a visit.
He became violently Insane on the Chi
cago and Alton train coming from Kansas
City and was taken in charge at Mason
City. 111., by the Sheriff and brought here.
He was In the same seat with Fay when
the latter was killed by robbers.
Ollnger is rational at times, but when
his mind reverts to the robbery he loses
all control of himself and is apparently
overcome by fear. He says the robbers
shot at him several times, and there is a
bullet hole In his valise. His wife wired
from Denver asking his condition and
that he be given every attention.

Stormy Scene In Souse.
LONDON, Aug. 6.â One of the stormiest
scenes of the present session of the House
of Commons occurred this evening when
William Ashmead Burdett-Coutts. Con
servative member for Westminster, de
manded greater powers for the hospital
commission to investigate the manage
ment of the military hospital in South
Africa. He declared that the truth would
r.ot be learned under the present plan of
investigation, as the soldiers would be
afraid to testify. A- J. Balfour, Govern
ment leader, in the course of a bitter
reply, accused Mr. Burdett-Coutts of
â¢â¢maligning the character of the British
army," and sneered at what he called the
"honorable member's evident nervousness
as to the result of the inquiry." He
poured a verbal lava tide of scorn and at
tack, some of his utterances being alrriost
inaudible amid the din arising from the
Liberal benches.

It Js not proposed that the commission
â¢chall establish civil government except at
; points where the military situation ad
'uiits of such conditions. It will co-operate
;^Â»:th th^ military to assure the natives of
the purpose of the United States and to
trf-at them with consideration. Fear is
expressed, however, that the insurgents
will urge a few Chinese to continue their
'resistance and to pay no attention to the
.statements of the commission, basing
their predictions of success upon the ne*
cessity of the American Government de
voting its energies to the restoration of
peace and order in China.
Ab explained to-day by a high official of
the Government all that section of Gen
eral MacArthur's work which may be
considered as of a legislative character
will be transferred to It. For instance, it
will make such rules and regulations as
may be needful for the establishment of
civil government, and which may be
amendatory of the order issued on thl^
eubject by Major General Otis. If it sees
Jit it can amend the orders relating to
marriages and divorce, prescribing rates
of duty, and for the administration of pri
vate schools. It will have certain powers
In the matter of appointment of officers,

SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC
â¢ VICTORY IN ALABAMA
ALL IN READINESS FOR
FORMAL NOTIFICATION
LINCOLN, Nebr., Aug. 6.â In accord
ance with Bryan's expressed wish, there
was' an entire absence of demonstration
on the part of the Lincoln people when he
started on the trip to Indianapolis to-day.
The party occupied a sleeper on the Den
ver, Burlington limited, which left here
a few moments after 6 o'clock and will
reach Chicago between 8 and 9 o'clock to
morrow. It was composed of Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan and their son. Governor
Thomas of Colorado and Mrs. Thomas.
John I. Martin, sergeant at arms of the
National Committee; Mr. Bryan's private
stenographer and Governor Thomas' sec
retary.
A number of Mr. Bryan's friends were
at the station, but there was no crush and
no demand for a speech. The curious ones
were limited to passengers on Incoming
trains from the East, who when they
were told the Democratic Presidential
candidate was on the platform soon
crowded around him. General O. O. How
ard, who arrived from Chicago to speak
to-morrow before the Epworth League
assembly, got off the train Just In time
to shake hands with Bryan before he left.
PACIFIC JUNCTION, Iowa, Aug. 6.â
Bryan's brief run from Lincoln to Omaha
was devoid of Interest except at the little
town of Gretna. As the train approached
this point Bryan explained that ten years
ago, when beginning his first campaign
for Congress, it was there he made his
first speech as a candidate. As the train
drew into the station a flagpole erected
then in his honor was to be seen still
standing. Quite a large crowd had con
gregated and Bryan was loudly called for
at the rear platform. He did not attempt
to make a speech, but In the space of
two minutes shook hands with about a
hurtdred people.
Mrs. Bryan was loudly cheered when
she appeared on the platform.
OMAHA. Aug. G.-Between 1000 imfl 2000
people assembled at the Burlington sta
tion at 7:30 o'clock to-niuht to see "W. J.
Bryan and party pass through. A cheer
went up as the train rolled in and Mr.
Bryan stepped out on the rear platform.
Before the train was fairly at a stand
still scores 'of enthusiastic people -Were
climbing over each other to shake the
hand of Bryan, who smilingly leaned over
the platform rail and cordially greeted all
within reach. A switch engine Interfered
"with the proceedings, but some rpcklesalv
sought to gain a foothold on the steps
until cautioned of the danger.

PERSONAL MENTION.
It seems as if the local Board -of Health will not
take a hint even from its own employes, two â¢Â¦', of
whom, recognizing their own unfitness, have resigned.
The boy who mistook an old man for a stray cat
and broke his jaw with a rifle ball ought to be given
ar. opportunity to study a little natural history in some
quiet resort. ' /
William Jennings Bryan's speech of acceptance of
the Presidential nominations is 8000 words in lcngth.-
There is little wonder that his admirers declare that
he is -endowed with a matchless tongue.
The local Democratic machine possesses at least
one virtue, if it has no other. That seven-minute
meeting, at which a decision was reached in reference
to State delegates demonstrated that the wheels of
the party machinery are exceptionally well oiled.
The Sacramento newspaper which has gone to the
courts to force the State Board of Health to make
public its reports on the plague ought to remember
that the subject is a very delicate one with the board
and not to" be discussed except in whispered privacy.
The Anaconda (Mont.) Standard of July 26 tells of
the wholesale poisoning of sheep on the Deer Lodge
range. The Standard says: "A month ago a large
band of sheep was brought into that region and
turned loose on the ranges. The strange sheep ate up
.nil the feed and cleared the ranges as slick, and clean
as a whistle. When the grass in one place had been
cleared off, the strangers and their sheep would press
forward, leaving a barren waste behind them. The
local sheep men, who had sheep of their own to feed,
viewed the situation with alarm. After the passage of
the strange band there was nothing left for the home
Thousands of sheep driven from the exhausted
ranges of Southern Utah across the Idaho line have
been met with guns, poison and legal proceedings.
Not only has this bloody and destructive conflict
raged between the cattle men and sheep men, but the
hand of the cattle man has been against the cattle
man and of the sheep man against the sheep man.
Since then' several thousand sheep have been shot
and poisoned in Colorado; several men have been
shot; water places and pumps have been destroye-l
and both sheep and cattle have been left to perish by
thirst; Wyoming sheep men have been driven ofF
the public range in Colorado with Winchesters;
mining prospectors have been intimidated on the pub
lic domain by armed parties of stockmen, and MÂ«\
Carter of Wyoming, a rich and prominent stockman,
was caught over the Colorado line with his stock,
taken prisoner and hanged to a tree. A placard pinned
to his dead body read: "Look all you want to. but
don't ask questions."
That was last April. Prior to that and for a period
of ten years there had been hostile encounters be
tween sheep and cattle men in Colorado and other
Western States and Territories, in which herders and
cowboys were murdered and animals were slaughtered
in contest for the free use and the privilege of de
stroying the public range.
IN his speech to the stockmen at Denver, opposing
the leasing of the public range, Hon. Tom Patter
son said: "It is false that there is any conflict be-,
tween the sheep and cattle men over the use of the
range."
WAR ON THE RANGES.
BRYANITES WAGER PROPERTY.
If McKinley Wins They Lose, if Bryan Wins They
Sell.
INDIAXAPOI.IS, Ind.â Some Bryanites here are so certain
of victory that they have practically offered to give away
their property if McKinley is elected.
Charles W. Bridges & Co., reputable real estate dealers,
have offered to deposit deeds to a cottage and five lots in
this city, a farm of 240 acres and twenty lots in the gas region,
it $11,200, the value placed on the property, also shall be de
posited.
Should McKinley win the depositors of the money will
get the deeds and money. Should Bryan win they will get
the deeds and the Bryanites the money.
BETS TO ENLIVEN CHICAGO.
Roses, Umbrellas and English and Irish Flags Figure
in Wagers. _^_
CHICAGO. 111.â Freak betting on the Presidential election
has begun already.
Henry Owen has agreed with Robert Haldon that If Mc-
Kinley is elected he will wear through December, January
and February a long stemmed American Beauty rose, fresh
each day. pinned to his overcoat. Haldon is to wear the
roses if Bryan la elected.
James McFadden has agreed he -will not carry an umbrella
until June 1. 1901. If McKinley wins, and if Bryan succeeds
Gustave Krohnan will go unprotected.
Frank Kennedy has wapered with M. J. Stlllson that Mc-
Kinley will be elected, and the loser is to wear for two weeek3
his clothes turned wrong side out.
Albert Hawthorn of Montreal is pledged in case Bryan
wins to pnrade from the Auditorium about the principal
streets with a band in front and a drum corps In the rear to
play Irish airs, while he carries an Irish fiaff. Patrick Doyln
under similar conditions is to carry the fins of Great Britain
if Bryan loses, and he says, "It would break my heart."
MULE AND MOTHER-IN-LAW.
McKinley Man May Support Woman, Bryanite May Be
Kicked.
DETROIT, Mich.â Mule and mother-in-law are involved in
an election bet made in Coldwater. Arthur Williams agreees
if Bryan is elected President to support George Stebbins'
mother-in-law for life. Stebbins agrees if McKinley is elected

until permanently disabled.

Editor Call, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir: Supplementing my letter of,
* July 18, permit me. to say that In answer to a letter addressed to the Commis
sioner General for the United States, calling attention to the desirability of hav
ing the California wines examined on their merit, ignoring their labels, I am In
possession this morning of a letter from Mr. J. H. Gore, "juror In chief." by which
I am Informed that the most recent decision of the jury on wines was to the effect
that all wines would be examined by the jury and the statement made concern
ing the labels would be referred to the administration for decision. Mr. Gore
adds that he will watch the matter as it develops, but hopes to receive a decision
that will consider only the quality of the wine, Independent of the label which
It may bear. If this course is pursuedâ and I now have no reason to doubt that
it will beâ whatever award of merit the California wines will receive will be upon
the naked merit of the article itself, and in this way whatever Injury the former
decision may have inflicted will be in a very great measure neutralized. This de
cision of the jury of award will supply the evidence, of a disposition on the part
of the jury of award to treat our products fairly, were such evidence wanting,
and it may be accepted as a cause of congratulation that *the just merit of our
wine product is to be recognized. Yours very truly, WILLIAM H. MILLS
Paris, July 21, 1900.
ANTE-ELECTION fervor is showing itself even before
the beginning of the campaign in fanciful wagers.
Partisans of Bryan and McKinley are willing to risk
ridicule to shew their faith, and in one case at least
even love has been risked.
Bryan Is rlocted President I will piv* 1 my consent, provided
you will apree that in the event of MoKinley's election you
â¢will not attempt to prosÂ»s your suit any further."
Howard hesitated and pleaded, but in vain.
"If you believe Bryan is going to win. as you have been
asserting," paid Johnson, "you should not hesitate to ac
cept my offer. If you do not believe you are not an honest
man." The compact wag then made.
FANCY RUNS RIOT IN
ELECTION WAGERS
That is the position of The Call. It is for the re
election of faithful and experienced Republicans io
Congress. It is opposed to the neglect of their duties
by Federal officials. Mr. Lynch has started upon a
career that bodes him no good, and if he studies the
record of his predecessor, .Welburn, with care he will
find in it a lesson which will incline him to attend to
his duties to the Government with more diligence
than he has been doing.
The Call has taken an interest in the re-election of
Mr, Metcalf because it knows how important it is that
California be represented at Washington by men who
have had experience in Congress and have established
there an influence sufficient to enable them to serve
the State with advantage. Where other things are
equal the experienced man is worth two inexperienced
men in any line of business, and it is particularly true
in Congress, where the struggle of the various States
each to have its special interests looked after renders
expert knowledge of the highest value. Over and
over again The Call has announced that principle. It
has repeatedly pointed out the prestige which com
paratively small States have gained in national affairs
by the practice of maintaining their Representatives
in Congress unchanged year after year. Mr. Metcalf'
is a stanch Republican. He represents the political
sentiments and policies of his constituents. He has
been tried and found faithful. His past service has
given him a knowledge that will enable him to be
even more serviceable in the future. So The Call ad
vises the Republicans of the Third District to re-elect
him.
Our Oakland contemporary must have been hunt
ing for "peculiar anomalies," and in bad need of find
ing one when it determined to take this as a specimen.
There is nothing inconsistent or anomalous in the
position of The Call. We object to Federal officials
using their offices and their time in doing politics for
anybody. Men who hold public office should attend
to the duties for which they are paid. The rights of
such men to exercise their political rights as citizens
is not to be denied, but what is known as "pernicious
partisanship" is not to be tolerated in any, official, and
in the case of Lynch the interferences in this county,
at any rate, have been of a pernicious kind. What he.
has done or is doing for Air. Metcalf we have not yet
been informed, but if he be acting in Alameda as he
is acting here and elsewhere, The Call condemns him
as severely in the one case as in the other.
Upon the basis built up by those statements the En
quirer places this commentary: "But what we starte:!
to call attention to is the peculiar anomaly presented
by The Call, which denounces Mr. Lynch so fiercely
for his political work in San Francisco, while it seems
to find no objection to what he is doing in Alameda
County. The Call alone among all the San Francisco
papers has thought it proper to break into the political
controversy in this county, and it does so as a cham
pion of Mr. Lynch's political friend. One is made
really curious to know what The Call's position is.
In San Francisco it is the opponent of Mr. Lynch,
but in Alameda County the two work together.
Does it really amount to this, that The Call is against
Mr. Lynch in San Francisco, but for him in Alameda
County?"
OUI?. esteemed contemporary, the Oakland En
quirer, has discovered what it deems an in
consistency in the course of The Call with
reference to the manner in which John C. Lynch
neglects his duties as Revenue Collector in order to
do politics, and abuses his official powers in the
process. The Enquirer asserts that Lynch is as active
in the politics of Alameda County as in this, that he
is supporting Metcalf for re-election to Congress, and
that The Call, while denouncing him for what he is
doing in San Francisco, approves of whet he is doing
in Alameda.

The committee of the National Livestock Associa
tion, appointed to draft such a law, meets this montth
in Salt Lake. It proposes to make the law optional
in counties. We think that Deer Lodge County, in
Montana, will be gbd to exercise its optiqn right
away, and that the border counties of Wyoming, Colo
rado and Idaho will not long hesitate to choose be
tween law and lawlessness on the ranges.
The events of the summer have emphasized the ab
solute necessity of a leasing law.
Lewis and Clark reserve in Montana
While these bloody and destructive conflicts have
raged over free use of what range is left, the results
of destroying the forage have appeared elsewhere.
The Call has heretofore noted the increasing drynes5
of the climate from stripping the Arizona ranges.
The soil, being stripped of its vegetable cover, no
longer conserves the rainfall. The deep springs are no
longer affluent. The streams are temporarily torren
tial in a rainfall, and are then dry. Thousands of
head of stock in Arizona have perished for want of
water, and the mad bellowing of cattle and bleating of
sheep, dying of thirst, have answered the demagogue
arguments against leasing the ranges.' In the thin
forests and brush lands fires have followed and baked
the earth, from the Black mesa in Arizona to the
When their owners applied for a warrant to begin
criminal proceedings the District Attorney refused
to issue an omnibus warrant for the entire population
of the district, and there the matter stands. Following
precedent, it is expected that the next act will be war,
and that murder will follow.
At first legal proceedings were attempted. But it
was easily shown that the marauders had 4 as much
right to the free range, dedicated to use in common
on the public domain, as the resident taxpayers. Then
the strange herders were threatened with personal
violence, but they were armed and stood their
ground. Then poison was resorted to, and their sheep
began dying by the hundreds.
sheep, and as a consequence those who had sheep in
that section were compelled to. drive them to'other
ranges, at great inconvenience and expense."
Let it be remembered, too, that this is done by
men who are admitted by Senator Tillman to have
commonly resorted to murder and fraud to effect the
same end before they learned to reach it by disquali
fying clauses in their State constitutions.
means of protection is stricken down.
No such spectacle has before been presented in
American politics. The negro did not vote to suit
Bryan's supporters, and they have disfranchised him.
They have denied him the right to consent or dissent
as to the Government under which he lives. They
can just as easily nullify the emancipation amendment
to the constitution. When the ballot was given to the
negro it was supposed to be necessary for the preser
vation of his freedom. When it is taken away, one
Flashing an imperial standard of tyrannical su
premacy when the constitution guarantees equality, it
must not be permitted to avert attention from itself
by accusing others.
He need not view with alarm the exportation of im
perialism to be reimported and destroy us. It is al
ready here, if the voters in a negro population of
13.000.000 can be disfranchised and denied aught that
is embedded in the constitution. The wisdom of giv
ing the negro the ballot is not now in issue. It was
given to him by the highest law of the land, and he
has, from time to lime, enjoyed its use for thi-ty'
years. If the constitution can be nullified in respect
to his rights, it can be nullified in any other respect.
If such nullification be imperialism, that pest is al
ready upon us, introduced by Colonel Bryan's party
and by no other. Ordinary partisan questions are
taken lightly by our people. What platforms say
takes on seriousness only from the character and
record of the parties which make them. But consti
tutional issues are of a more serious nature. The
party which comes to the defense of the constitution
must not come through a hole torn by itself in the
fundamental law. Talking of the necessity of govern
ment by consent, it must not present itself as the de
nier of consent to millions of people. Demanding
equity of others, it must itself do equity before it can
get a hearing.
Can Colonel Bryan escape the logic of the situation?
If denial of the guarantees of the constitution is im
perialism, is not that system already seated in the
States that will give him their electoral votes?
But, whether good in law or not, the fact stands as
a fact in political tactics and ethics that the negro vote
of the South is wiped out, in spite of the Federal con
stitution. Yet the flag is in North Carolina and the
other States which have done this thing, but on the
face of the returns the constitution is not there.
Yet State after State in the South has taken it away
from the negro. North Carolina is the last to strike
it down. By a majority of probably fifty thousand
that State has just nullified the provision of the Fed
eral constitution. This is done by providing an edu
cational qualification so worded as to discriminate
against the illiterate negro in favor of the illiterate
white. This is done by providing that no man shall
be disqualified by it whose father, or perhaps grand
father, was a qualified voter prior to 1865. or some
other year antedating the suffrage guarantee of the
Federal constitution. As the negroes were not voters
at the time fixed, there is no ancestral qualification to
descend to their posterity. But as all whites were
voters then, their qualification descends with their
illiteracy to their children. It is probable that th<
Supreme Court would hold this to be a denial of the
ballot because of a previous condition of servitude,
unless the argument is good that the terms of the
constitution apply only to the existing individual and
not to his ancestors, and as he has not been in a con
dition of servitude, denying him the ballot is not on
account of such condition.
The constitution declares that the right of a man
to vote shall not be denied because of race, color or
previous condition of servitude. That right is well
regarded in this republic as the right preservative of
all rights. Without it no other right is considered to
be safe-
Colonel Bryan and his party desire to apply this
theory abroad, lest it should fail at home. In refusing
to apply it abroad they see imperialism, and profess to
fear that it 'may react at home, and by impairing the
domestic application of the constitution may estab
lish imperialism in the midst of us. The Bryan party
is already in power in the Southern States of the
Union, in which it expects to give him 120 electoral
votes for President.
Events in- that section justify the inquiry whether
the flag is there.
/^OLONEL BRYAN'S platform declares that the
I constitution follows the flag. This means, we
suppose, that wherever the flag is there is the
constitution also, with all the rights, privileges/im
munities and conditions which it imposes or guaran
tees.
FLAG AND CONSTITUTION.
The 'Kansas man who has staked his best girl on
Bryan's chances in the present campaign is evidently
a gentleman of no deep affection.

The Call confidently counts upon a triumph for
honest politics in the committee. It believes that
Herrin and his associates will be beaten in their efforts
to establish a domination over the majority pf the
members. It is hardly credible that any considerable
number of them can be so blind to the trap that has
been i-et for them by the Southern Pacific and the
Mint Saloon gang that they will deliberately wall:
into it. Should the tricks and manipulations of the
schemers be successful, however, and a majority of the
committeemen vote with them, then this one thing
wiil happen: The workingmen, business men, pro
fessional men and capitalists â all the better elements
of the Republican party in this cityâ will exercise an
independent judgment at the polls. The bosses can
not elect bad men. San Francisco Republicans are
not going to Â«ubmit to the dictatorship of a Demo
cratic boss in the employ of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, and the members of the County Committee
might as well recognize that trupi at the start.
The men who are now seeking to dominate the Re
publicans of San Francisco are the same who in times
past have been repudiated by Republicans. They are
the men whose very* pretensions to be Republicans
have so compromised the party that independent vot
ers and a pood many Republicans voted the Demo
cratic ticket and made the Phelan administration pos
sible. The old firm of bosses has been changed only
by admitting Mr. Herrin as a member. To the g.^ngs
of toughs and saloon-rounders that Crimmins and
Kelly control there have been added the gangs of rail
road workers who take orders from Herrin, ami
to that extent the combination is more dangerou;
than it was before. Otherwise it is virtually the same
as it was.
What member of the committee can hope to have a
political future in the Republican party if at this junc
ture he votes to betray the control of the party organi
zation into the hands of the Southern Pacific Railroad
and its disreputable allies? What can it profit him in
the long run to vote even for a compromise with men

whose purposes are adverse to every true Republican
poiiry in the city and the State?

watch closely the vote on every issue that arises
during the meeting. They will note who vote for
genuine Republicanism and who ally themselves
with the bosses. Every man's record will be pub

the responsibility of the action he takes.
WHEN the Republican County Committee
meets this evening the members will find them
selves at the fork of the political road. Up the
road to the right the rank and file of honest Repub
licans beckon them. Down the other road Heron
and Crimrnins and Kelly command them to go. It
is the choice between the people and the bosses, be
tween right and wrong, between the straightforward
way which leads to victory for the party and honor
for the committee and that crooked and uncertain
â¢way which dishonors every man who takes it and

rt SOLDIER'S funeral was held In Redding:, Shasta County, recently,

J from many, not related to the dead, mingled with thoso of the supposed
aunt of the deceased. Mrs. Effle Dr,ury. who, clad In deepest mourning.
gave way to sobs while the services were going on and while the remains
were being lowere.: to what was thought would be their last resting place.
It was thought that the body covered by the earth In the Redding Ceme
tery was all that was mortal remaining of Harry H. Stone, a well-known
young man of that town who enlisted some months ago and went to fight
under Columbia's banner in the far away new possessions. The body ar
rived on a transport a short time ago and was taken to Redding by Mrs.
Drury. The people of Redding determined that fitting honor should be done
the memory of one who had died In the military service of his country. â¢
Those -who had formed the large concourse at the funeral had scarcely
reached their homes and friends were still consoling weeping Mrs. Drury.
when It was learned that the remains that had been burled were not those
of Harry II. Stone, but of Herman H. Stone of Worcester, Massachusetts.
The father of the dead hero proved th.a to the satisfaction of the mourning
Redding lady and the body was disinterred, sent to Worcester and there
buried a second time with fitting honor.
The dead man was a member of Company K of the Tweny-second Infan
try: killed In action at Santa Rosa, Philippine Islands. Mrs. Drury
claimed the body when it arrived here on the transport as that
of her nephew, Harry II. Stone, and at her request it was shipped to Red
ding, where the funeral was held as stated. Hardly had the Redding funeral
party returned from performing the last sad rites, when a telegram was re
ceived by Mrs. Drury stating that the remains were not those of Harry H.
Stone, but of Herman H. Stone of Worcester. The" father of the dead soldier
had received a letter from a comrade in Manila, informing him of his son's
death and of the shipment of the remains to San Francisco. The similarity
of initials had caused the mistake.
Mrs. Drury made Inquiries at army headquarters nnd learned that her
nephew was* still alive and not at all anxious to fill a grave.

death of John E. A. Helms. Mr. Helms
was a director of the Grocers' Associa

proposition to transfer only the eighth
and the advanced eighth grades. Mr.
Wrbster advised him to restore tho old or

TROUBLE OVER TRANSFER
OF THK GRAMMAR PUPILS
MODEL OF THE HISTORIC PORTSMOUTH AS SHE J LIES
ALONGSIDE THE MARION. \
THE Naval Battalion will be well rep
resented In the Admission day cel
ebration. A model of the old frigate
Portsmouth has been made and will
not only be sailed In the regatta but will
be placed on a truck and towed In the
parade.
The Portsmouth was the ship that
brought the official, news of California's
admission to the Union to San Francisco.
Chief Boatswain's Mate John J. Foley
took the sailing: launch of the Marlon and
with great skill and much labor made her
Into an exact reproduction of the old
frigate that brought good news to thÂ»
golden west. The launch Is now a full
rigged ship and her crew on the trial trip
will consist of fourteen men. Captain Xat
T. James will be In command and Lieu
tenant Henry Peterson will be navigating
officer. For fear of an accident the steam
launch of the Marlon will accompany the
Portsmouth so that in the event of a
capsize there will be no fatality. The
cruise or trial trip of the little ehip will
take place on Thursday.' â¢
The model of the Portsmouth is a per
fect reproduction of the old-time Â¦warship.
Every spar and sail has been dup.icate.l
and not a rope is out of place. The old
smooth-bore guns have been duplicated
with pieces of wood, but the men's quar
ters are not as commodious as they might
be. It will take a man for every sail to
handle the model In a moderate breeze.
LOG RAFT BREAKING UP.
Another menace to navigation has been
cast adrift in the ocean. The Immense
log raft that left the Columbia River In
tow of the tugs Tatoosh and Rescue last
week Is breaking up. and when last seen
not more than half of it was left.
Steamers arriving from northern ports
have nothing to report but logs strewing
the ocean from Eel River to Cape Men
doclno.
The steamer William H. Kruger arrived
yesterday morning from Tillamook. via
Eureka. The captain report that on Au
gust 5. at 9 a. m.. the vessel ran into a lot
of ptles. From 9 a. m. to 8:30 p. m. the
menaces to navigation were passed, and
then the mystery was solved. The tugs
Rescue and Tatoosh were passed with
"half a log raft In tow." The other half
had broken away and the logs composing
It were strewn all along the Mendodno
coast.
The steamer Dispatch arrived from Port
Hadlock. On August 5. at 10 a. m.. she
ran Into the piles fifteen miles northwest
of Cape Mendoclno. For seventeen miles
she ran her course through them and at
7 p. m. sighted the tugs and the remainder
of the raft.
The steamer Matteawan on August 5, at
5 p. m.. off Mendoclno City saw the tuga
and the raft, half of which was gone.
The lumbermen who risk their money
In the venture give no thought to the
danger from a floating pile. It matters
not to them that a vessel may be sunk: by
one of these dangers to navigation so long
as they make money. Half a raft landed
In San Francisco will pay a dividend, but
the other half adrift on the ocean may
cause the loss of hundreds of lives.
TRANSPORT SHERMAN ARRIVES.
The army transport Sherman got Jn
from Manila via Nagasaki last night.
She made the run In sixteen days from
Japan She brings 53 cabin passengers,
11 discharged soldiers. 13S disabled men,
12 prisoners and lf> civilians. There were
three deaths during the trip.
WATER FRONT NOTES.
The. British ship City of Benares ar
rived early yesterday morning from Lon
don. She had heavy galps off the Horn
for twenty-one days and had a number
of sails blown away.
The schooner Americana arrived In port
last night. She was 150 days from Iquique
via Honolulu 50 days. She was almost
given \ip as lost at one time and :>n per
cent was paid to reinsure her. Then news
came of her arrival at Honolulu, hut her
long trip from that port was beginning
to make her owners anxious, when she
put In an appearance. Light wlnd3 and
calms caused the delay.
Visitors Â¦will be received aboard the bat

The assistant secretary has also re
ceived a letter announcing that C50 ex
cursionists will come from Los Angeles
by the morning train on September 8 and
that a like number will come up on- the
evening train. The hotel and accommo
dation "committee declares that It does not
matter how many strangers come here,
provision having already been made to
accommodate 1S0.O00. The beautiful post
er" announcing the celebration are being
distributed Jn nil parts of the State. These
will do much to advertise the celebration,
as they are most attractive. *
Tbp Invitations to the various functions
will be In the highest style of art. but
what the Stanford boys will pride them
selves most on will be the badge. It Is
of gros grain Mlk, dark blue, and all the
lettering and figures are In colored silk,
making one of the most elaborate affairs
of the kind ever got up for a parlor. The.
badges are to be worn by members. A
limited number will be presented to ladles
and these will have the word "guest" at
the head. Only one will be presented to
a male guest of the parlor.
Stanford Parlor No. 76. Native Sena of
the Golden West, proposes to make the
finest display of any of the parlors during
the celebration In this city. It has always
laid claim to being the most artistic local
parlor In all Its social functions, and It
expects to be the most artistic In the cele
bration. At its headquartera.lt will have
an elaborate display In electric lights, the
central flpure being a reproduction of a
past president's ' badgw, the design of
which Is the Golden Gate with the settlnsr

CHILD LIFE IN LIBERIA.
It Is somewhat surprising to find how
frequently a scientific myth reappears In
the columns of the public prints, and it is
equally interesting to note that most
myths of this kind at least possess a nu
cleus of truth.
There is one statement which makes Its
appearance here and there almost with the
unvarying regularity of the sea serpent
chronicles. I allude to the idea that the
eye of a murdered person can retain the
image of the murderer, presumably as the
last reflection of the outer world the eye
received.
Yet there Is a scientific germ from which
such a notion may have taken Its origin.
In the retina, or nervous network of the
eye, exists a substance called "hodopsin,"
or "visual purple."
This coloring matter bleaches in the
light, but is rapidly replaced in the dark.
On this eye-purple, light, of course, haa
a specific effect, and an experiment of
Kuhnc serves to demonstrate the nature
of the interaction between the color and
light waves. , Â¦'Â¦ \ Â¦ - Â¦ 'Â¦ . "Â¦_Â¦Â¦ ;
Making a dark chamber of wood a hole
was bored and covered with a movable
curtain. Through this hole the light pen
etrated Into another chamber containing
a pane of ground glass, separated from
the hole by a considerable Interval. Over
the pane a chrome yellow paper was
placed. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Then the eye of an albino rabbit which,
previously to being killed, was kept in the
dark, was carefully removed, and, under a
light>which would not interfere with the
purple color, was placed against the'dia
phragm of the dark chamber.
The yellow curtain was taken away, and
the eye. after being exposed for five min
utes, was removed, and examined In order
to see if any image was developed there
in. After sundry trials Kuhne. by fixing
the purple, saw the divisions of a window

representing the image that had been re
ceived by the eye.
The purple color, however, has to bo
fixed, as photographers say. by the ad
dition to it of a solution of alum
Physiologists tell us that the eye purple
Is not essential for sight, for we reallv
see most clearly with the part of the
retina where no purple exists.
We must conclude that the color forms
a kind of background for vision in fact
rather than an essential condition of vis-
Ion. But the fleeting images which the
purple of the eye may form of things
seen, it is evident, can bear no relation to
the wondrous tales which the modern de
tective story, calling to its aid the results
of scientific research, founds on the pho
tograph of the murdered person's eve-
London Express. '
Indians, he hurried Inland as fast as hÂ«
could go to find an Indian town as full of
gold and precious stones as those which
welcomed Pizarro in Peru. With the
characteristic stupidity of his infamous
predecessors, he relied upon the sword
to conquer a country which might have
been secured by kindness. The first batch
of Indian captives was flung to blood
hounds, though upon the chief the kinder
torment was inflicted of an amputated
nose. The Indian arrows, the dismal
swamps, the tangled forests, the smother
ing heat, the fever-breeding climate, thÂ«
scarcity of food, turned them back Â»t
last, and the survivors reached the gull
near the mouth of the Mississippiâ the
most of them to perish in the fierce
"northers." still a menace to the sailora
on the mighty gulf.
Fernando de Soto had been with Cor
dova at Nicaragua and had had a haml
in the conquest of Peru. Made Governor
of Cuba in 1537. he offered at his own ex
pense to redeem the unkept promise of
Narvaez and was authorized by his sov
ereign to conquer and occupy the lan<i
embraced within the patent of his pre
decessor. In May of 13.1S he anchored at
Tampa, within sight of the spot whem
eleven years before Narvaez had set out
on his ill-starred expedition. Though D<Â»
Soto had roundly blamed Pizarro for his
horrid treatment of the Inca. and though
he knew full well the baneful conse
quence of the foolish, faithless policy of
Narvaez toward the natives De Soto
proved just as silly and as cruel. No
indignity was too fiendish for him to try

LYMAN P. POWELL.
Philadelphia.
Around the name of Juan Ponce de Leon
there is the halo of a rich romance. Of
noble pedigree, a companion of Columbus
on his second voyage, a rather famous
soldier of fortune already past the hey
day of his youth and growing old and
blase. Ponce de Leon added to Spanish
love for gold an insatiate desire to be
young enough to extract from gold Its
full dellsht. In his earlier dais he had
The Spaniards used not merely poor
judgment in the solution of their coloniz
ing problem; they used no judgment at
all. They sent out foolish, weak and
graceless men to deal with concerns that
required men wise and strong and true,
and they gave to all the "Christian scoun
drels" they sent out carte blanche to go
where they pleased and do aa they liked.
The -Jamestown settlers were overeager
for gold, but there was a John Smith
ready at the proper moment to reduce the
chaos to some order. The Dutch were
ciiiefly interested in the economic value of
the new America, but they were not
averse to work or to trade for their re
ward. The pilgrim fathers, in the well
known playful words, first fell upon their
knees and then upon the aborigines, but
this was just a fleck upon the fair fame
of the settlers of New England. The
Spanish explorers had no redeeming
traits. Cruel, lazy, greedy, they came
hither for the solitary purpose of dis
covering gold, and the gilding of their
greed with pious professions of devotion
to the cross made It the more nauseating.
Never caring to make a home or to found
a nation, they were impatient to despoil
the land of all its gold and then sail back
to Spain to be flattered and envied by a
people always overfond of the tinsel and
the glitter of this life of ours. The men
who packed Mexico. and Peru, who tram
pled the best development of Indian civ
ilization to pieces under the hard hoofa
of cruel conquest, who worked the soft
inhabitants of the adjacent islands to
death and replaced them by black men
captured in the wilds of Africa, were Just
gold hunters, nothing more. And Span
ish colonization was in consequence fore
doomed to failure.
Columbus was the worthiest of all the
men that Spain sent out. and he was not
a Spaniard. Vasco Nunez de Balboa, call
ed inaccurately Balboa by English writ
ers is tha most attractive of all the un
attractive Spaniards who came hither. A
bankrupt and a rebel, he crossed the
ocean In 1501 to repair his fortune by good
luck - To escape imprisonment for debt
In Haiti he took passage concealed In a
cask In an outbound vessel, and when the
vessel was wrecked off Darien he led a
revolt against the captain. Encisco, who
had spared his life, deposed Encisco and
made himself by the force of an unscrupu
lous character commander of the com
pany. One day while on a foraging ex
pedition not far from the present town of
Colon, an Indian chief, observing the
greed of the Spaniards, told them of a
vast ocean to the westward where gold
was as plentiful as pebbles on the shore.
Here was at last the chance for Vasco
Nunez to repair his wasted fortune, re
trieve his ruined reputation and atone for
his great treason. September. 1513. he
left Darien with nearly 200 men, blood
hounds and Indian guides. He fought his
way with needless cruelty through tribes
of hostile Indians, "hewing them In pieces
as the butchers do flesh in the shambles"
or giving them over to the dogs, which
tore them limb from limb "as If they were
wild bores or Hartes." On September 23
he found himself on the crest of the Cor
dilleras, not far from the line of the pre
sent Panama railroad, while at the base
glittered for many a mile a waste of un
known waters which" Vasco Nunez, albeit
he fell upon his knees in awe. could not
have dreamed was the largest ocean on
the globe. Wading out Into the water to
his waist he took possession of it In the
name of Spain and called It Mar del Sur,
or South Sea. to distinguish It from the
Mar del Norte, as the Spaniards termed
the Caribbean. Vasco Nunez made several
voyages along the Pacific coast and fell
a victim to the fears and jealousies of
a rival, the Governor of Darien, who had
him beheaded in 1517. ~

ways In the long run paid to the utter
most the hard penalty of the witless and
vicious policy she allowed her colonizers
to initiate and to follow, to her and their
undoing. From the very moment the
lonely followers of De Soto sunk his
weighted remains in the midnight dark
ness to the bottom of the Mississippi River
the lines Professor W. P. Trent wrote in
1S9S have been veraciously accurate:
Thire hour is come, a stronger race
Succeeds and thou must fall.

As wormwood unto call.
And yet thou hast but reaped what thou hast
FERNANDO DE SOTO.
But they were never good colonizers.
With them colonization was always, in
the words of Swinburne, "a hideous and
Boeotian jest." Where other nations
achieved at least a moderate success the
Spaniards never lost a chance to make
an arrant failure. Not one of their ex
periments, viewed In the larger light of
history, could by any warrant of imag
ination Tje,<ralled a real success. Not only

grievously, but the mother country al-
In temperament and training the Span
ish people seemed suited to the task of
exploration. For many years they had
been at war with the Moors, and in the
school of war had learned to take blows
as well as to give them. Inured to the
hardships of campaigning, they were
ready to bear their full share of the trials
of the pioneer. Their love of adventure
was now at Its full and the strain of bo
hemlanism in their blood was now most
evident and most imperative. To leave
home and kindred and country made few
demands upon their feelings. Most of
them could set sail without a pang and
with none of the anticipatory dread of the
homesickness which under the modern
name of nostalgia did great damage to
our soldiers In Cuba and the Philippines.
Fierce adventurers that fell on kingdoms
for their prey, the Spaniards seemed of
all the European peoples to be just the
men to open up the new world to settle

heard, of course, the Oriental stories of a
fountain where the oldest might renew
hi3 youth. Possibly he had read the spu
rious letter of old Prester John, who
vowed he could commend the fountain,
because he had tried it once himself.
When word came to -Ponce de Leon in
Porto Rico that the long-sought fountain
was now at last located, that Indiana
said it could be found in an island called
Eiminl, northward of Hispaniola. he could
scarcely wait the coming of King Ferdi

the whole expense, he set sail on his pa

and spring, and then in disappointment

near the site of St. Augustine. He tar
ried long enough to name the country
Florida, to find the story of the fountain
all a myth, to cruise a while among the
neighboring islands, and then at last to
return to Porto Rico, still white-haired
and wrinkled and a little older. In 1321
he came out once again to found a col

Indians, and he received a wound In the

, .
The first definite movement toward oc
cupying the Hall of Justice, which was
recently accepted by the city, was made
yesterday when Sergeant Charles H. Mc-
Donald, who keeps the records of the Po
nce Courts, commenced to remove his
books and other paraphernalia to the new
building. The sergeant was the last to
leave the old hall seven years ago, and
ho will be the first to locate in the new
one.
While Superintendent of Public Build
ings Barnett has reported to the Board of
Public Works that the Hall of Justice la
in a filthy condition and that many of
the rooms are unfit for Immediate occu
pancy, the work of cleaning is being
prosecuted as rapidly as the limited
means at his command will permit. Trash
of all kinds has accumulated and it will
take at least three weeks to clear out the.
debris. Barnett said yesteraay that he
hoped that the apartments set aside for
the Police Courts and their accessories
would be in shape some time next week.
It is expected that all the criminal de
partmerts will be installed in the new
structure ..before another month. There
is corresponding rejoicing among the
property owners and shop keepers in the
vicinity as the long delay In finishing the
building has beeen. exasperating, to say
the least.
Expert Cyril Williams of the Board of
Supervisors has filed a statement of the
expenditures incurred in building the Hall
of Justice. Itshows that the sum of $10,000
remains, which is available to place the
building in a perfect condition. After
other claims are satisfied the Board of
Supervisors will appropriate segregated
amounts to pay for whatever improve

architect.

The Board of Supervisors passed to print
yesterday an ordinance providing for a
|;rant for a period of forty-five years to
| le San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railway Company of a right of way
and the right to construct and operate a
railroad along Illinois street, from the
r.orth line of Fourth to the north line of
First avenue south.
The franchise is granted upon the ex
press conditions prescribed in the charter
end Eubje<a to other additional conditions.
One of iheVmer is that the railway com
pany will, at any time when required by
i esolution of the board, construct a draw
bridge across the waterway known as
I^Iais Creek Channel, to accom
modate tlie travel upon said street or any
other drawbridges ihat may be required
over any other channel which exists now
or may hereafter exist.
The work Â«>f construction must be com
menced and completed within two years
irom the passage <>f the ordinance, if the
corporation should ever grant, assign or
lease, or In any manner dispose of this
franchise or allow to any other common
carrier the use of the right of way thus
granted then the franchise shall cease
j.r.d all right? and privileges thereunder
eball be forfeited.
The ordinance was passed with an added
amendment presented by McCarthy,
which provides that the space between the
two inner lines of rails shall not exceed
f (>ven feet and that the rails shall be
placed at equal distance? on each side of
the centf-r line of the street.
It is also provided that if at any time

Within fifteen days after the first Monday in

a careful examination of the assessment books
of the- city and county and ascertain therefrom
the amounts of all taxes that should have been
collected by the Assessor and which have-not
been collected. He must then etate an ac
count to the Assessor and demand from him
that the amounts bo remaining unpaid shall
be paid into the county treasury within fif
teen days from the date of said de*nand. It
at the expiration of eaid time the Assessor has
not settled for and paid said amounts into the
treasury as aforesaid the District Attorney
must commence an action in the proper court
against the Assessor and his, bondsmen for the
recovery of eald amounts so' remaining uncol

In the report filed with the Auditor by

The persistent boasting of Assessoi
Dodge that he has added largely to the

to receive a severe setback in a few days
when that official will be called upon in
the courts to -account for a large amount
of taxes which he has failed to collect.
George Petty, expert to the Auditor, fin

the assessment roll yesterday and made
the startling discovery that Dodge has

The attempt of the Market-street Rail

street and Fifth street into electric sys
tems was opposed at yesterday's meeting
of the Board of Supervisors by Acting
Mayor. Tobin, who held that the wires
should be placed under ground.
"To grant the privilege to erect over
head wires," said Mr. Tobin, "is clearly in
violation of an existing ordinance. The
question, however, should be referred to
the City Attorney to determine the issuea
involved."
A motion to refer to the City Attorney
was adopted. It directs that official to
inquire into the resolution withdrawing
all objection to the work of reconstruc

PRINCE EUI WAH, second son of
the Emperor of Korea, has ideas
of his own upon what constitutes
an American education. His royal
papa provided him with a highly respect
able Gilbert and Sullivan kind of a pre
ceptor by name Sin Fa Mao and shipped
him to Roanoke, Virginia, via San Fran
cisco. The Prince and his tutor arrived
here on Saturday, on Sunday they saw
the sights and yesterday the Prince was
looking for a flat.
â¢ The Prince was sent to imbibe a few
modern ideas. Apparently this action was
needless. The Prince has already about
as many modern ideas as are good for
him, at any rate he snys the brand put
up in San Francisco is "the goods," and
he doesn't see the use of going to Roan
oke, Virginia, with Mr. Rin Fa Mao. his
chaperon, who is at his wits' end to know
what to do with his troublesome charge.
Mr. Sin Fa Mao is second secretary of
the Korean Legation at Washington and
Charge d'Affaires ad interim. But Prince
Eui Wah cares no more for him than if
he were the new charter. "What's. the uso
of being a Prince." says he, "if you can't
have your own way?"
Prince Eul Wah told the reporters on his
arrival here that he was going to school.
Now he says he's going to rent a flat.
That seems quite American, he says.
Mr. Eul Wah ST., Emperor of Korea,
has been cabled to In order that he may
issue an imperial mandate for the gov
ernment of the refractory sprig of
royalty. But then it is doubtful whether
an imperial mandate -will be of much use.
Roanoko, Va., sounds lonesome while San
Francisco, Cal.. is on the map. It is
understood that the Prince may take up a
course of English at Berkeley or Stan
ford if he cannot be Induced to go to
Roanoke. That spot and Korea are yet
to be heard from in regard to the prince
ly escapade, but it is to be supposed that
such â¢ an acquisition as real live royalty
will not be lightly yielded by the Roan
oke College, and between the Emperor,
Mr. Sin Fa Mao. and the Roanoke faculty.
Prince Eul Wah may be induced to turn

eastward. In either event an enterpris
ing comic opera librettist has here a good
foundation for a lively plot.
Sin Fa Moa, In spite of his somewhat
rakish name, is a most proper person to
take charge of a Prince. He bases his
only hope in the royal mandate.
"Jf that doesn't have any effect." he
said gloomily last night. "1 don't know
what will be done. I've got to get him to
Roanoke somohow, but even the royal ele
phants would, unless his mind changes, be
powerless to make him leave your city.
He is ." If the royal preceptor had
not been so highly respectable he would
have said "above the limit," as it was he
merely added, "Incomprehensible."
The Prince could not be seen at the Oc
cidental last night. Perhaps he was out

CHICAGO, Aug. 6.â Offerings of wheat at the
opening of that market were very light and
the presence of buying orders In moderate num
bers sufficed to give the market a fairly firm
tone. Liverpool was closed and local traders
were somewhat uncertain as to their course
at first. Initial trading In September was at
75075 1 ,ic, a shade advance over Saturday's
closing and a further advance to 75%c took
place within a few minutes. Local bears,
enVouraged by the heavy receipts at all pri
mary points, then attempted to force prices
down In the absence of any material support,
and their offers did result in a reaction to
73c. But at the decline buying orders werÂ»
received and soon as the local offerings were
withdrawn the price immediately reacted again
to 7S%c After 11 o'clock the market for tha
most part was excessively dull. The weather
was too hot for the traders to take much in
terest In the demand and the result was that
prices kept within a narrow range. Septem
ber advanced to 73*i'S'75^c, whera it closed, a
gain of HSHc
Corn enjoyed a brief Interval of prosperity
around the opening 011 reports of damage in
the South by hot winds. The latter part of the
session was dull, but the close was Â»trong,
September %c higher at 37 s Â«c.
Oats were very Uull during most of the ses
sion, but the tone was tirm. September closed
*i,ij'*c 'higher at 21H'i}21Hc.
Provisions were dull all day. Lower hog
prices and fears of further yellow fever de
velopments made buyers timid at first and
opening prices were lower. Offerings were
small and later the firmness of corn had in
fluence on trading. At the close Septembrr
pork was unchanged, lard 12',4c higher and
ribs 5c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

in fervrnt tones to Police Judge Smith
this morning that he would prtfer being

for a <ontinua!!ce of his case until the
"Washington authorities could be notified.

WANT PURE POLITICS
IN THE COMING FIGHT
There Is a movement on foot among the
well-known and popular Democrats that
bodes no good to the wing of the party
known as the Phelanites. With a strong
politician of the Thirty-first District at
their head, a meeting will be held Thurs
day evening at Pythian Castle, and judg
ing from the amount of voters who have
declared themselves in Its favor the new
organization will put a heavy crimp in
the programme which Is being made up
by the czar of the local party. Dissatis
fied, but not as bolters or kickers, thia
faction will for Its first move make a de
termined effort to have the control of the
coming primary election taken from the
County Committee and for the State Cen
tral Committee to hold the primary under
Its own auspices
â¢Another object of the movement will be
to do away with by legal means the civil
service section of the charter. Much ar
gument will be brought to bear to show
that the civil service law Is a subterfuge
for the bosses, and that as It stands It Is
their very weapon of power and the path
way for Ignorant and incompetent ward
hfelera to good positions, to the detriment
of capable applicants.- a condition which
the civil service law itself wai framed to
P 7t Is the Intention of the organization. It
no redress can be had from the State Cen
tral Committee, to nominate for the No-^
vember election a ticket of Its own mad*
up of candidates for the judiciary of men
well known for their anti-boss principle*.

Supervisor Mitchell suggested that the
testimony should be written up in order
that the Supervisors m'ght have an op
portuntty to study It flnd the hearing was
adjourned until next Monday.
"Are there any other candidates who
are working in your office securing similar
Information?" asked Supervisor Mitchell.
"Only yourself and Mr. Booth." replied
the County Clerk.
"I am not reflecting upon the Board of
Supervisors, but upon the Governor of th-Â»
State, Â¦who refused to sign a bill which
had passed with but one dissenting vote
and which would have granted me the
relief necessary." replied the County
Cl*rk.
"Why don't you tell why you don't get
nny help from the Supervisors?" nai-i
Supervisor Church-. "You have no rlghf
to reflect upon the board."
"Yes." replied the County Clerk.
"And the gas that has been referred to
would have been burned anyway?" con
tinued'Mr. Baker.
"Yes. and I want to say that these ex
tra deputies paid by outsiders ar* dolnst
work for which the county might be com
pelled to pay otherwise, for I have been
unable to secure any help from the Super
visors."
"Your clerks are engaged In perfecting
the Great Register at the same time, are
thev not?" asked Mr. Baker.
"Was anything done except to furnish
to citizens of this county such Information
fin they have a right to secure?" asked
Mr. Baker.
"I am doing only Â¦what has always been
done." said Mr. Jordan, "and to which
there has been no objection before."
"Then it comes to thts." said Mr. Chap
man, "the rooms, furniture and gas nf
the county are being used for the advance
ment of private political ends?"
Mr. Chapman ceased his fftiestions and
George W. Baker asked a few in behalf
of hfs client.
"I had nearly my entire staff." replied
the County Clerk, "but they were engaged
only In public work. Mr. Metcalf can
put In twenty-five deputies. If he wanta
to."
At this point M. C. Chapman announced
that he represented Mr. Hardy and de
sired to ask some questions. Mr. Snook
objected upon the ground that Mr. Hardy
ought to be present.
"I would like to find out how Mr. Hardy
came to know the things stated in hia
complaint," said Ccunty Clerk Jordan,
"and I would like to have him present."
But Mr. Hardy was not present and Mr.
Chapman began a steady bombardment of
questions.
"How many employes have you In your'
office not under county pay?" demanded
Mr. Chapman.
"About twenty-five or thirty." replied
Mr. Jordan.
"F?y whom are they paid?"
"Mr. Dalton has paid all salaries." re
plied the County Clerk.
"How many regular deputies did you
have at work In your office yesterday?"
asked Mr. Chapman.

block books were sent out. campaign lit

thousand certificates that were to be used
for voting at the primary. In this I
was advised at that time by my present
attorney. Mr. Snook, that my action wast
legal. This work was paid for by Emil
Nusbaumer. Supervisor Church knew
of this work and not only did not object
to it. but wrote me a letter asking me
to Issue certain special certificates which
I did not do. as I considered them im
proper. These certificates were issued
only for the use of Mr. Metcalf. and I was
assured that they would be used leglti-,
mately. How were they used? They
were found in the hands of 'rockrollers*
who Â¦were not entitled to them. They
were found In saloons and In the hand3
of persons who would do the bidding of
Mr. Metcalf. I offered the same facilities
to Mr. Hilborn. but hi? managers werÂ«*
not as' smooth as the others and did not
take ndvantage of my offer. Another pri
mary comes around, and one side makes
a request for certain Information. They
i supply the help, block books, material
j and all expense. This request was grant
Â¦Â¦ ed, and an offer was made Mr. Metcalf of
| the same facilities. I believe that even
some of the members of this board have
men at work securing similar informa

OAKLAND. Aug. 6.â County Clerk
Frank C. Jordan was the storm
center In Oakland to-day. The
Board of Supervisors occupied the
day in investigating h!s office and trying
to "learn whether he was using it for the
purpose of furthering private political
ends. Prominent men from all walks of
life filled the rooms to watch the proceed
ings Coming at the particular moment in
the campaign that it did, the incident was
given additional flavor and every move
was watched with the greatest Interest.
The County Clerk knew that It was a
critical moment and he threatened to tell
something about the campaign of two
years ago, In which he was variously im
plicated. He hurled this threat at the
opposition several times and finally made
his statement, which resolved Itself down
to an assertion that he was doing for Mr.
Dalton and against Mr. Metcalf this year
exactly what he did for Mr. Metcalf and
against Mr. Hilborn two years ago.
The morning session was uninteresting
compared with that of the afternoon. It
consisted merely of the Introduction of
written charges against the County Clerk,
signed by W. B. Hardy and presented by
Supervisor Church. These charges were
as follows:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the County of Alameda. State of California- ;
Gentlemen: As a citizen and taxpayer of the
SmntC of Alameda. I respectfully call the at
tention of your honorable body to and hereby
Imerniy earnest protest against the action of

the public business.

as Â»uch cltUen and taxpayer I hereby enter

The presentation of these charges was
followed by the introduction- of the fol
lowing resolution by Supervisor" Wells,
the only Democrat on the board:
Whereas. Grave charges have been filed with
this board imputing misconduct to the County
Clerk In connection with the use of his office
for purposes other than the transaction of the,
i.ubllc business, whereby detriment and loss Is
aliened to have been and is now beln? Inflicted
upon the taxpayers of this' county; and
Whereas It 1Â» further charged that the pub
lic business appertaining to the office of the
County Clerk Is made to sufTer by reason of
the aforesaid acts of misconduct on the part
of eald County Clerk; and v^
Whereas. This board is charged with the duty
of maintaining offices and apartments for the
use of the County Clerk as a public officer and
not otherwise: and - 'Â¦-. -' Â¦"Â¦.-â¢
Whereas, It would be a flagrant abuse of
nower on the part of this board to permit or
allow said offices and apartments to be used
(as Is alleged) for private purposes and parti
san politics or for any other purpose than the
transaction of the public business; now there-'
Â°Reso1ved t That the aforesaid charges be thor
oughly investigated by this board, and for that
purpose that reasonable notice forthwith be
Klven to Frank C. Jordan, County Clerk, to ap
pear before this board at a public meeting of
tho board, > and then and there . answer such
questions as . may be put to him concerning
such charges filed with this board as afore
said, and that a true copy of Â»ald charges and
of these resolutions be served upon said Frank
7' HE most remarkable session of the Alameda County
Board of Supervisors ever held zvas that of yesterday,
wticn that body gathered to listen to the charges that
County Clerk Frank C. Jordan zttas using his office to further
the political interests of Henry P. Dalton, aspirant for Con
gress.
Written charges ivere Hied with the board, and during the
afternoon County Clerk Jordan was on the stand. Mr. Jordan
took refuge behind the statement that he zvas doing this year
no more than he had done for other candidates before.
Never before in the history of the Board of Supervisors
has there been such a large attendance upon a session. The
room zvas filled, it seeming as if every man zi'ho could possibly
find time to attend zvas present.
The Supervisors took no final action in the matter, and
th$ special Deputy County Clerks are still sending Out the mat
ter complained of.
C. Jordan, together with eald notice to appear
as aforesaid.
County >Clerk Jordan said that he would
not proceed without his attorneys and the
hearing went over until the afternoon In
order that they might be present.
The afternoon session opened with the
rooms packed to the door3. Every man
who could take the time from his busi
ness and ever>' politician in Oakland wa3
present. Among those in the lobby were:
District Attorney Allen; Frank W. Storer.

The first fight of the afternoon was on
the question whether W. B. Hardy, who
made the charges, or County Clerk Jor
dan., should be put on the witness stand
first. There was much battling over this
point until Chairman Roeth announced
that he would rule that Mr. Jordan
should take the stand. Mr. Baker then
asked that subpoenas be Issued for Mr.
Hardy. Victor H. Metcalf. Emll Nus
baumer and Judge Henshaw. for their
ride of the case. An order was made to
this effect, and County Clerk Jordan took
the stand.
District Attorney Allen propounded a
series of questions covering the charge
that the County Clerk was using public
property for private campaign purposes.
"Not one particle of public property has
been used, with the possible exception of
a little gas." replied the County Clerk.
"I now desire to show that my accusers
have profited in the past exactly as
ethers have profited in the past week."
"Confine yourself to this matter,
please." said Mr. Allen.
"I intend to appeal to a higher tribunal
than this." declared Mr. Jordan. "I know
why these charges were brought, and I
desire to go Into the whole matter. I
have never used any public property ex
cept for the benefit of the people, and In
the discharge of my duty. I now deÂ«lre
to go into this matter from the beginning
of my term as County Clerk, and tell
what happened at other primaries."
This was followed by an effort to con
fine the County Clerk to the Incidents of
the past few days. The County Clerk
finally triumphed and succeeded In get
ting In his statement about former pri
maries.
VI will state that no county property
has ever been used for anything except
county business, and with this statement
I want to show that what la now being
done has been the custom with all parties
and all campaign managers. What I
have done for Dalton this year was dnnÂ«
for Mr. Metcalf two years ago with the
full understanding and consent of Judge
Henshaw. Mr. Metcalf, W. E. Dargfe,
Emil Nusbaumer and Supervisor Church.
I know why these charges have been
brought, and I have a ri?ht to show the
whole scheme and conspiracy."
This brought forth more Interruptions,
but the County Clerk persisted in his ef
fort to tell of the past and continued: "I
am willing to tell what I have done in
the past and what T am doing now. First
came the Hllborn-Frick primaries. At
that time I got out a supplemental regis
ter upon which there were 19.000 names.
There were thirty or forty people em
ployed, using the furniture of the office
and the lights, but not public stationery.
Then came the Pardee-Davis primary.
Similar work was done upon that occasion
and the expense was divided between
the two candidates. After that there was
another primary, and my office was used
In the Interests of one candidate by
Messrs. Xusbaumer, Metcalf. Henshaw.
Dargie and. others. I told Mr. Hilborn
at that time that any accommodation that
I extended to one would be extended to

preciative audience. It is rarely Indeed

Inferior in wit nnd polish to that of "The

that tells a nor improbable human story.
A? such it is vastly superior to "The Great

tor to-day Emperor William delivcred"a
notable speech, dwelling upon tho dark
days of the thirty years' war and the "im
ppri.Â«hable service" rendered by Frederick
William In building up the country from
the hope of establishing a great northern
empire, which one day should draw to
gether the German fatherland.
"This wonderful result." said the Em
peror, "has finally been fulfilled and chief
ly because every Prince has been animat
ed by the consciousness that he was only
an earthly governor anil had to render
an account to a higher King.
"To me, it is perhaps, granted to fulfill
a part of the Great Elector's dream. What
he could only point to we are. now able to
take up on a larper scale, because we are
united In the fatherland and marching
forth In an army consisting of the sons
of every hamlet In Germany, to support
the black, white and red flag, which
shows the arm of the Kaiser reaches to
the remotest parts of the world. Without
the Great Elector this would have been
Impossible. -

Unless some unforeseen technicality
arises Judge Greene will hear Horace W.
Philbrook's petition on August 17.
After deciding that he was the only one
to preside, Judge Greene was requested
by Philbrook to set the case for trial be
fore August 28, the date originally set
The petitioner wanted the cases set'down
for next week, but the court decided that
George W. Reed and W. P. Bosley, attor
neys for the Merritts. should have proper
time in which to prepare a defense and
set the case for August 17.
The latest turn in the erratic wander
ings of the ostracized case was taken this
morning when It was unexpectedly an
nounced that the application for guard
ianship would not be transferred from
Judge Greene's department but would be
heard by him. When the/?ase was. called
this morning Judge Grefcne announced
that neither Judge Ogden nor Judge Ells
worth would hear the petition. Both de
clined, he said, "for good and sufficient
reasons." As Judge Hall U disqualified
to serve because of his r#atlonship to
Attorney A. A. Moore, the' matter must
necessarily remain in Judge Greene's de
partment. -.\- Â¦_Â¦Â¦'
Since Philbrook filed his petitions sev
eral w<Â»eks ago, the case has been con
tinued from time to time and transferred
from one department of the Superior
Court to another until each one of the
four. Judges has either heard portions of
it or refused to preside.
The application of Horace W. Phllbroolc
to be appointed guardian of James P.
Merritt and the children of James P.
Merritt and Mary Webster Merritt and
Frederick A. Merritt and Mary Brown
Merritt. is a matter that none of the Su
perior Judges of Alameda County seem
anxious to decide. Until to-day it was a
case without a court to try It.

Contractor Left Accounts Unsettled
pud Guarantors Are Trying to
Compromise With TJn

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 6.
The Alcatraz Masonic Hall Association
Is at loggerheads with the United Stated
Fidelity and Guarantee Company because
of a refusal of the company to settle with
creditors of Contractor Grant, who erect
ed the building and bought his bond from
that company.
Grant foil behind in his payments be
cause of the lapse of some of his sub
contracts. He recently went to Xome and
left behind him a big batch of creditors,
who have filed llenn upon the 'new Ma
sonic Hall amounting to $6000. Before de
parting Grant turned over $&00 to the
surety company. The .hall association
holds $1000 due the contractor. The com
pany is now making an effort to settle
with the creditors at 75 cen-ts on the dol
lar. The hall association has blocked this
move in the interests of the creditors,
who, the directors insist, shall be paid In
full.
This course would Involve a loss to the
guarantee company of about $1200, but the
hall directors declare that the company
accepted the risk and that the creditors
must be fully protected.
"The lodge doe.* not propose that a
single lirm shall lose a dollar on the builu
ing," declared Charles E. Snook to-day.
"We have $4800 in sight to meet these
claims and the remainder due must be
paid by the guarantee company.. The as
sociation insists that there shall he no
compromise, because these creditors are
entitled under the conditions of the bond
made by the surety company to the full
amount due them."
Those who have filed liens are as fol
lows: John A. Marshall, $515; Remillard
Brick Company. $1292 75; J. O. Larrabec,

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
"It is evidently intended to intimidate
the men into withdrawing their demands.
They will not do so. The employers were
all given notice months ago that the men
would demand a shorter working day.
They had ample time to arrange for the
new order of things. It will affect all
mills alike. There is nothing whatever
in the argument that they will have to
compete Â¦with mills elsewhere not af
fected. The fact is that after August 14
no material from unfair mills will bo
handled. The mill operatives on both
sides of the bay are thoroughly organised.
They have the support of the Building
Trades Alliance, which means that the
laborer, the bricklayer, the carpenter, the
electrician, the decorator, the paper
hanger, the cement worker, will refuse
to lift a trowel, handle a hammer or saw
or do anything else on a building in
which material from any unfair firm
enters. There are some mill owners who
are ready to concede the justice of the de
mands of the mill operatives. If others
refuse they will have to meet the issue.
The operatives are not seeking trouble,
but they, believe that their demands are
just and reasonable and that if the mill
owners had agreed to co-operate for con
cessions instead of combining for conflict
there would have been no difficulty in
making an adjustment to meet the new
conditions."
One of the members of the local union
stated this afternoon that the ultimatum
of the millmen would have no effect on
the stand taken by the operatives. He
said:
"The purpose of this notification," said
C. L.. Ineler of- the firm of Iugler & At
kinson, lo-rlay, "is to give \ne men a
chance to think on more than one side
of the subject. Many of them have been
driven into the Aliiunen's Union. Some
of them we know Are not in earnest. We
learn from them what is going on among
them. When they learn what we are go
ing to do they may think of their wives
and families, and some of them may
drop out. Wo do not deny them the stand
they have taftÂ«n,-but we also have rights
and that is why we have taken our stand.
There is so much irregularity in the mill
business that it is impossible to put it on
the basis that the men want. If the men
fail to recede from their stand it will not
only affect them but all the building
trades."
The ultimatum of the mill owners of
this city to their employes who have de
manded an eight-hour day is in accord
ance with the ultimatum issued by the
owners across the bay. They have re
fused to accede to the demands of the
men and have posted notices that on and
after August 13 they will continue to
operate their mills on the same time
schedule as heretofore.

Justice Brewer decided that whatever
wrongs the Metropolitan Company or the

moneys amounting to Â£983, which he was
accused of embezzling.
In 1SS8, he said, he was a solicitor In
London and became connected* with the
firm of Silsbee, Arnold & Co., which
afterward became bankrupt. In 1895 the
sum of Â£953 was Invested by him in India
3 per cents in conformity with the pro
visions of the will of the testator, W. H.
Swain, a part of the interest to be paid
scml-annually to the widow and the re
mainder to be allowed to accumulate for
the benefit of the sons.
Mr. Arnold went on to state that in the
year mentioned by the request of W. M.
Swain, one of the beneficiaries of the
trust, he sold the India bonds and rein
vested the proceeds, Â£9S3. in the Plere
mont Park estate, a property which was
being handled by his firm, and the inter
est. 4U per cent, was regularly paid by
Arnold's firm to the widow from 1S95 until
December, 1899, when the firm collapsed
by reason of the decline In English secur
ities caused by the Boer war. The
amount stood on the ledger of the firm
credited to the Swain trust fund, which
would participate in the distribution of
] the firm's assets of $100,000. He. Arnold,
: was not personally involved in the mat
ter, it being a part of the business of the
: firm.

After robbing a number of rooms south
of Market street and getting away with
conslderaMe booty the bold thief yester
day transferred his operations to North

liams, who lives In a lodging-house k*>pt
by a Mrs. Olsen at 1439A Pacific street.
While trying to open the door of Wil
liams' room with a skeleton key the thief
â¢was discovered by Mrs. Olsen. who asked
him what he wanted. In a pleasant man
ner he announced that he was a friend
of the occupant of the room and was
anxious to see him on important business.
Mrs. Olsen told the burglar that Wil
liams would not return before evening and
asked him to leave his card. The thief
after apologizing for not having his rarJ
â¢with him requested her to get him a sheet
of writing paper and a pen and ink. as he
was anxious to leave a note for Williams
asking him to call at his office.
While the unsuspecting woman went to
her private apartments to get the paper
the clever rascal opened the door of Wil

watch and some other articles of minor
value. When the landlady returned he

LEFT NOTE FOR
HIS VICTIM AFTER

This testimony was to support the con
tention of the defense that Arnold was
not a fugitive from justice. He then pro
ceeded to tell the story of the Swain trust
"None at all," was the prompt reply. "I
g-ave every cent of my money and all my
property to my creditors before I left
London, and filed a petition in bank
ruptcy. At the time of my departure there
was no charge pending against me and
nothing in the nature of a charge was
threatened."
"How much money did you take with
you from England when you left?" asked
Mr. Schlesinger.
The most interested person in the
courtroom outside of Mr. Arnold was his
wife. Sh<Â» sat bf-hlr.rt him ond ili'l iv' -c
low a word of the proceedings to escape
her.
Messrs. Cormac and Donohoe, of coun
sel for the English creditors, did all they
could in the way of objecting to the ad
mission of Mr. Arnold's testimony. They
argued that in an extradition case, such
as this, it was improper to allow the ac
cused to make a defense, the sole object
of . the examination being to determine
whether or not there was probable cause
for extradition. After a strong argu
ment by Bert Schlesinger, counsel for
Arnold. Judge Heacock decided to hear
the testimony of the accused in explana
tion of the manner in which the Swain
trust fund became lost.
JULIAN' TREGENXA BIDDULPH
ARNOLD, the accused son of Sir
Edwin Arnold, took the oath be
fore United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday and explained
how the Swain trust fund came to be lost
In the general smash-up of the investment
firm with which he had been connected
in London. His bearing was that of the
son of an illustrious sire, and the manner
in which he told of his connection with
the Swain trust bore the impress of truth.
The railroad people on both sides of the
street do not like the situation as the
problem presented is an awkward one to
eolve.
The Jobbers of San Francisco are to be
heard from on the subject of changing
frpijrht rates to the advantage of their
competitors', and if it becomes necessary
for them to speak they will do so in no
uncertain tones.
The Los Angeles men Â¦were accompanied
by Edward Chambers, general freight
agent of the Santa Fe at Los Angeles,
who. with the other railroad men, listened
to the arguments of the Angelenos with
out entering into a discussion of the im
portant subject. In fact there was no
anxiety to consider the matter at the
present time with an intention to render a
decisive opinion. The whole proposition
If still open and it le highly probable that
Ihe s-entlemen frcm Los Angeles mill find
it necessary to repeat their plea, before a
decision Is reached.
The pentlemen came to this city for the
purpose of getting the railroad companies
to place the IÂ»s Angeles jobbers on the
Bring Une in fighting for the business of
the low< r San Joaquin Valley. Their com
plaint Is that the two railroad companies
in adjusting their freight tariffs regulate
them in favor of the Jobl>ers of the me
tropolis. A pro rata mileage rate is what
the committee wants. The members In
eist that the business of the section in
Â¦which they are bo much Interested nat
urally belongs to them and they assert
that it Is the province of the railroad
company to Bee that they get it.

"It s ls hardly necessary at this time,"
continued Judge Dunne, "fox me to go
into a detailed statement of the facts of
this case. Your conduct, even had you
been a layman, was most reprehensible,
but as you are an officer of this court I
can hardly find words to characterize your
conduct. The Judgment of this court is
that you be fined $500 and be confined in
the County Jail for a period of five days."
Rogers and counsel immediately busied
themselves preparing a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus. He was finally led
away to Jail by the Sheriff, and Barclay
Henley went before the Supreme Court
and filed the petition. Late in the after
noon the higher tribunal issued a writ of
habeas corpus In the case of Rogers and
made the same returnable before that
body at 2 p. m. to-day, at which time the
legality of the prisoner's commitment to
Jail will be determined. >Â¦:Â»: â¢
"After having been instructed to answer
questions r before the Grand Jury, as set
forth in the affidavit filed herein by the
District Attorney," said Judge Dunne,
"and having been instructed to answer
these questions by this court, it appears
that you have refused to obey the order.
I therefore adjudge you guilty of con
tempt of this court. Have you any legal
ground why Judgment should not be
passed by this court?" "
"None but the five contained in my affi
davit which I have presented to the
court," responded Rogers.
Judge Dunne sustained the objection to
Rogers' affidavit and again commanded
Rogers to stand up.
"Under these circumstances," said Deu
prey, "I submit that it is for your Honor
to pass sentence."
When the proceedings In contempt
against Rogers were called by . Judge
Dunne, Barclay Henley, who represented
the accused, announced the latter's pres
ence. Assistant District Attorney Deu
prey presented an affidavit signed by W.
T. Kibbler, in which the deponent testified
that James Taylor Rogers had again re
fused to answer questions propounded by
the Grand Jury and relevant to an Issue
before that body.
"I inform your Honor, as does this affi
davit," said Mr. Deuprey, "that James
Taylor Rogers Is guilty of a willful viola
tion of the order of this court made on
July 25 last. He is present in court and I
ask that he be dealt with accordingly."
"James Taylor Rogers, stand up, com
manded Judge Dunne.
"If your Honor please I have an affi
davit signed by this respondent," inter
rupted Henley, "in which are set forth the
grounds upon which he refused to answer
these questions."
Mr. Deuprey examined the affidavit and
announced that therein Rogers made no
denial of the fact that he had refused to
testify. On that ground the affidavit waa
objected to.
Once again James . Taylor Rogers, the
one remaining unlndlcted principal in the
conspiracy to rob the unprotected estates
of the Intestate dead, has been committed
to Jail. Again, and under oath, he assert
ed In open court yesterday that to tell all
he knew of the theft of the estate of the
late Joseph Sullivan would be to lay him
self, liable to prosecution for a felony, to
degrade him before his associates and to
assure his disbarment. His plea availed
him naught and | the court pronounced
Judgment upon him. Five days in the
County Jail and $500 fine was the sentence
passed.
When Judgment was pronounced upon
him, Rogers rose from his seat, raised his
hand as though to protest and then again
dropped Into his seat, chuckling and rais
ing hla shoulders to the muajc of his own
voice. It was apparently sC nervous ef
fort to impress the public with his cheer
fulness, but the mask fell when he left

The itching and burning I suffered In my feet and limbs for three yean
Â¦were terrible. At night they were worse and would keep me awake a
greater part oi the night. I consulted doctor after doctor, as I was travel-
ling on the road most of my time, al3o one of our city doctors. None of tho
doctors knew what the trouble was. I got a lot of the different samples of
the medicines I had been using. I found them of so many different kinds
that I concluded I would have to go to a Cincinnati hospital before I would
get relief. I had frequently been urged to try CUTICUBA REMEDIES,
but I had no faith in them. My wife finally prevailed upon me to try them.
Presto ! What a change I I am now cured, and it is a permanent cure. I
feel like kicking some doctor or myself for suffering three years when I
could have used CUTICURA remedies. H. JENKINS, Middleboro, Ky.
