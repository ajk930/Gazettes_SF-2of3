WASHINGTON, July 19. â The Japanese legation here has made public the latest commun
ication received from Baron Nissi, the Japanese Minister to Peking. This telegram was
received to-day at the legation from the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, and is im
portant because of the dates given. The telegram was dated July 17 by the sender, the Japanese
Consul at Chefu, and is as follows:
LAST APPEAL FOR AID
FROM PEKING LEGATIONS
TAKU, Friday, via Chefu, July ly (delayed in transmission). â The situation in Northern
China is much more serious than is generally realized. It is now common talk that the foreign
powers will wait until the end of September before beginning the advance upon Peking. In such
event the anti-foreign movement is likely to extend to Southern China in spite of the Viceroys'
efforts.
Thus far the relations of international troops have been cordial, but there is no unity of ac
tion for want of a head. Only about 12,000 foreign troops are in Tientsin.
In the engagement to-day the foreign settlement was constantly shelled by the imperial
troops, who assaulted yesterday the British positions at the point of the bayonet, but were
repulsed. The Chinese troops are showing unexpected fighting power. They are equipped with
better arms than the foreign soldiers. The Ninth United States Infantry is now all in Tientsin.

SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
FROM THE FAR EAST
â¢"*f ROM St. Petersburg comes a categorical statement that the Russian Government has
J* received confirmation of the massacre of all envoys and foreigners in Peking on July 6.
W A Chinese, merchant who has arrived in Shanghai is credited with having
witnessed atrocities which make the blood run chill.
A correspondent who has seen an official dispatch from Chefu stating that the lega
tions were still safe points out that the agent who transmitted the message expressly re
fused to guarantee the authenticity of the statement. J
Sensational reports that the Russian Government had handed the Chinese Minister to
St. Petersburg his passports are contradicted. Certain districts on the Amur have been de
clared in a state of warâ in other words, placed under martial law.
Port Arthur, the Russian naval -base)* at the extremity of Liao Tung peninsula,
has been cut off jby the Chinese, who have burned two towns in the neighborhood of Niu
chwans:-. which is itself menaced. v .
LONDON, July 20.== Just as it was going to press this morning the Daily Telegraph received a brief dispatch
from its St, Petersburg correspondent saying that the latest information to hand there was to the effect
that the Russians had routed the Chinese at Blagovestchensk and had occupied the town in large force,
ST. PETERSBURG, July 19.== A state of war has been declared in Amoor district, embracing the towns of
Blagovestchensk, Khababorvsk and Vladivostok. According to the announcement by the general staff, however,
the situation in Manchuria has improved. Since General Gritski, chief of staff at Port Arthur, took over supreme
command, he has systematized the pushing of reinforcements to the disturbed districts There is general sur
prise in military circles at the energy with which the Chinese are entering on the campaign in Northern China, at the ad=
mirable state of preparation in which their armaments are, arid at the effective use they are making of their weapons. Fur=
ther extensive movements of Russian troops in Central and Eastern Asia are in progress. There is no doubt that Russia
intends to bring her Asiatic forces generally up to the fullest possible strength. It is aiso noticeable that troops are being
moved in the vicinity of Merv, on the Afghan frontier.
LONDON, July i9.==FolIowing the Russian declaration that a state of war exists in Amoor, it is expected England,
Germany and France, and possibly the United States, will at once declare war against China.

LONDON, July 20.â The DailyJelegraph has received a private dispatch from its St. Petersburg correspondent, which,
in confirming the Peking massacre, says:
"I learn from a source which may be regarded as thoroughly trustworthy that the Russian Government is actually in
possession of definite news to the effect that all the Ministers and foreigners in Peking have been massacred. I understand, more
over, that an official dispatch conveying the sad intelligence has been communicated to the Czar himself. The terrible event, ac
cording to the information received by the Russian authorities, took place on June 23, Russian reckoning, which corresponds with
July 6 in the ordinary calendar. It "is:a somewhat noteworthy fact that the news reached St. Petersburg the same day."
flcials put.jrreat reliance upon the in
formation given by the letter. It la evi
dent that there was no expectation by th#
Ministers of assistance from the imperial
Government, i In fact. Baron N'ishl espe
cially mentioned Chinese soldiers as par
ticipating In the assaults. The reports
therefore, that the Chinese imperial
troops went to the assistance of the for
eign Ministers is received with doubt. The
great fear of the besieged was plainly
that they would not have sufficient am
munition to defend themselves until the
arrival of reinforcements. It la thought
here to be out of the question for the al
lied troopa to begin their march at once,
notwithstanding the appeal from Baron
Nishi, and. even if they did start. It wouM
Beem to be Impossible for them to captura
Peking in time to rescue the Ministers If
they be still alive. The authorities are
consequently forced to the conclusion that
the. Ministers must be abandoned to their
fate.

the journey with difficult}'. The substance of the letter is as follows:
" The situation at Peking is extremely critical. The foreign legations are surrounded on
all sides by Chinese soldiers and bombarded night and day. The members of the legations, the
guards and residents, are resisting to the utmost, but the overwhelming numbers makes opposition
hopeless. Our ammunition is being exhausted. Our lives are in such danger that we may be
massacred at any moment. We earnestly request the immediate dispatch of reinforcements for
our rescue from our precarious conditions.' "
The Japanese Consul at Chefu adds that he communicated this letter to his colleagues of the
consular body there and also to the commander of the forces of the powers.
Another cablegram received through the Foreign Office from the Japanese Consul at Chefu
reports that Tientsin castle was captured by the forces of the allies on the 14th and the safety of the

Li Hung Chang and his suite ar
rlvcd here yesterday evening and
landed this morning. The Vice
" roy was received with a salute of
seventeen guns and a guard of honor from
the Welsh Fusileers, and with a band pro
ceeded to the Government House, where
he was received by the Governor, Sir
Henry A. Blake, General Gaselee, Barrow
and other officials. Li Hung Chang was
extremely reticent. He stated that he had
received definite news that the Ministers
and foreigners at Peking, with the excep
tion of Baron von Ketteler, the German
Minister, were safe on July 8. The im
perial decree recalling him to Peking, the
Viceroy said, was due to the Empress and
Emperor, and not to Prince Tuan. '
Governor Blake exerted all possible
power to Induce LI Hung Chang to remain
in Canton, but the Chinese Viceroy pro
ceeded, ostensibly for Shanghai. The Gov
ernor of Canton is regarded as an.excep
tionally weak official, and the belief is
that he will never succeed in maintaining
order.
It may be decided not to permit LI
Hung Chang to go to Peking. He says
he will not return to Canton and that his
future movements are uncertain. . ;

CONCERT OF ACTION
PROPOSED FOR POWERS
ROME, July 19.â The Government has
received a circular from M. Delcasse, the
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which,
It is understood, has been dispatched to
all the powers", proposing an international
agreement for joint action in China and,
the future attitude of the powers.
The matter Is still under consideration
here. Lord Salisbury, the British Premier,
and Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is un
derstood, has already replied In a friendly
spirit. The replies of the United States
and Russia have not yet reached M. Del
casse, nor has the reply of Germany. The
latter Government, it appears, had previ
ously made a somewhat similar proposi
tion to the United States alone. It Is
reported that President McKlnley hesi
tates to Join with the other nations, but it
is regarded as practically assured that all
the powers, in view of the danger of the
situation, will negotiate regarding M. Del
casse's proposal and finally sign an agree
ment on the China question.

CZAR IN POSITION TO

LONDON. July 19.â The Importance of
the Chinese declaration of war against

Fition to act independently, and not only
with reference to the defense of his do

ly clear, and since the news given out by
the Chinese Minister has not always been
confirmed by facts it is impossible to per
mit him to communicate freely with hU
Government under the fiction that there
Is no war."
The article goes on to insinuate that the
German Government had expected the
Chinese Minister to take the initiative to
show the Foreign Offleeall the mpsaasos
as an evidence of his" good faith, and
adds: Â»
"The German Government has given
fresh evidence of its frank and above
board policy, since it could easily have se
cured the correspondence through bribery,
I which it disdained to do. It i3 a matter
(.of honor for the Chinese Minister to re
spond to the loyal attitude of the German
Government toward him with proof of
j loyalty on his part. The step Is an appeal
to his moral sense."
The Vossisehe Zeitung and the National
i Zeitung discuss Count von Bulow's step.
I giving it their full approval. The Kreuz
I Zeitung considers it very doubtful that
the. powers will harmoniously carry out
the programme laid down by the Foreign
Secretary.
"The possibility nrust ever be kept In
mind," says this organ, "that the powers*
may disagree and that each will with
draw to its own sphere of influence. At
any rate, U is now certain that the war
will last for a long time, and the present
troops in the field are entirely Insufficient.
Doubtless. If the United States Govern
ment has already created a military basis
in China. Washington would new make a
claim for a separate sphere of Influence.
If Imperialism succeeds at the forthcom
ing Presidential election, a strong expan
sion policy toward China Is to be expected
from the United States. In any event.
In order to make their Influence felt in
the coming reorganization of the Chinese
Government, each power will probably es
tablish further points of support in
China."
The Lokal Anzelger says it learns that
the troops marching upon Peking will re
ceive orders not to destroy the imperial
palace.
Considerable apprehension I* expressed
by the German press that the Chinese
fleet Is preparing to attack German trans
ports upon their arrival, but this anxiety
is not shared by the Foreign Office.
With reference to the proposed prohibi
tion of the shipment of arms In China. tht>
Foreign Office says that the matter has
been left to the admirals, who are exer
cising due watchfulness.
The Foreign Office does not believe tha

INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
July 19.â PubMciy relying upon Ruc
fla's assurances to pursue in China
the fame policy advocated by the United
Staus. the administration officials are
disposed to discredit the reports that the
Czar has de-dared war on the Celestial
dovrrr.nv'Ut or cant* mplaics doing so.
Sf. de Wollak, the Russian Charge d'Af
faires, cajled ui>on Secretary Hay this
morning and announced his disbelief of
these reports. Bad a-* funh*r evidence of
their incorrectness the officials point to
the failure of Kmbassador Towf-r to cable
any information on the subject to the
Department. In fact, the messages
he has sÂ« nt have specifically stated that
Kussia has assumed the fame attitude as ,'
the United States. This means, therefore. |
that she regards the condition in Peking j
as "one of virtual anarchy." Looking j
upon the situation In this light, the au- j
thortties say that Russia would hardly
declare w?.r upon China when, so far as
blown, the machinery of that Government!
has been st-ized by the Insurgents.
Siberia Besieged.
It is regarded as entirely plausible that j
the Russian Government has announced ;
that certain >t the Siberian provinces ad
joining Marchuria are in a state of sli-ge.
the objr-ct of which is to place them un
<\< r martial law and give the military a
fr(-f hand in dealing with the situation.
A declaration of war by Russia would re- j
suit in her subjection to many annoyance* J
which she could avoid by prosecuting hos- j
tilities as the other powers propose to do. j
An official explained this afternoon that a ]
declaration would compel other powers to |
immediately proclaim neutrality. Failure
!Â¦> do BO DOOld only be construed as an in
tention to f=ujÂ»port China. If all should
declare neutrality Russian ships would be
allowed lo remain in neutral ports only a
specified time, the supplies they could ob
tain would be limited and th^re would be
other disadvantages te handicap her op
orations. Being at war with China. Rus-
Eta. might attempt to blockade the entire
MÂ»a coast of China. To this those power?
pospppping: ft>horrÂ«! of influence and those
whose commercial Interests would be af
fected would strenuously object.
Declarations of war would not neces
sarily compel the T'nitcd States to with
draw. It Is Important that the American
Government would know as expeditiously
as possible what the situation Is in Pe
king, and instructions to the American
troops to proceed there have not or will
not be changed, whether Jlussia declares
var or not. The authorities appreciate
that the Russian column now at Tientsin
might receive orders to act independently
of the 'allies, but the pressure the
united powers could bring to bear upon
the Czar would cause him, it is believed,
to relinquish any territory his troops
n'ig'ht endeavor to occupy.
Germany's Policy.
In connection with consideration given
reports of Russia's action, the authorities
have not failed to pay attention to the
policy of Germany. Kmperor William's
purpose to avenge Baron von Ketteler is
applauded by the administration, but his
warlike utterances arÂ« looked upon with
considerable ?uppicion. At the same time
the authorities do not propose to go be
hind the declaration of Count von Bulow
that Germany "desires no partition of
China and desires no special advantages."
France will certainly not declare war,
according to the view expressed here.
Such a declaration would be a complete
overturning of her policy as announced
by M. Deleave, the French Minist-er of
Foreign Affairs, who asserted in the
C hamber of Deputies that "the situation
In China was such that it is impossible for
one power to declare war."
It is understood the Cabinet at its ses
sion to-day carefully discussed the official
messages and press reports that have
been received, and in connection with this
discussion Russia's attitude was consid
ered. L'pon the conclusion of the meeting-,
a Cabinet officer announced that "nothing
had been brought before the Cabinet, to
cauÂ«e the President to change in the
s!;ghtest degree the policy announced in
the note of July 3. communicated to the
powers of the world."

CHICAGO. July 13.â A special from Fort
Williams, Ontario, to the Times-Herald
says:
Indians huntins on the east coast of
Hudson Bay have brought word to the
Hudson Bay Company's post on the
west coast of James Bay that they found
last spring a vast quantity of wreckage,
the bodies of two men. and a man In the
last stages of the death struggle. The In
dians reported that they could not under
stand the language he spoke, but that it
was not English. He died while they
were there, and they returned to the trad
ing post without bringing any evidence of
the Ftrange occurrence.
It is believed by the officials of the Hud
son Bay Company that the Indians wit
nessed the ending of Andree's attempt to
reach the north pole by balloon. They had
never seen a balloon, but from their de
scription of the other wreckage the offi
cials are firmly convinced that It was the
remnants of Andree's airship. A party
guided by the same Indians has been
sent out to bring evidence to establish the
identity of the party.
Early last fall people near Moose Fac
tory asserted they saw a large balloon
passing over to the northward, and this
tends to confirm the story of the Indian
hunters.

W. W. Roekhill Appointed to Investi

in the Far East.
WASHINGTON, July 10.â The appointment of W. W. Rockhill. director of
the Bureau of American Republics, as special commissioner from this
country to go to China and investigate and report on the situation, has
been made.
For some reason the officials did not care to have It known that Mr.
Rockhill had been selected for this responsible duty. "Within a week
he will have a final conference with the President and Secretary Hay and then
will leave for China. He then probably will go to Vancouver and there take the
Japanese line steamer for Yokohama, proceeding from that point to Shanghai.
Not until he arrives at Shanghai will Mr. Rockhill undertaketo outline his further
course.
His position is a peculiar one; he will be actually an Embassador In powers,
and so the scope of his functions will be akin to President Cleveland's paramount
commissioner to Hawaii, Mr. Blount.

We the members of the Chinese Empire Re

erace which has fallen upon our native land
because of the awful <Je<>d<Â« committed by a
horde of mad. religious fanatics, known to im
mediate history as .BoxerB. Me wish to ex
press our heartfelt sj-mpathy for the innocent
foreigners who have been so cruelly murderM
bv these savage bigots of Northern China, and
we realize that it will require more than the
noble forbearance of the civilized races to for
give the dastardly deeds of these moral idiots,
who have tortured and killed without reason
and without cause, and It is our earnest prayer
that they may receive such condign punishment
from the followers of civilized codes as they
richly deserve. We further pray that the Great
Creatorâ the God of all, Christian and pagan
alikeâ may punish them for ten generations to
come In order that their polluted progeny may
not defile the dust of the earth where good men
must live.
Here in column conclave we promise to teach
our children to pray ten tlmo3 each year for
the happiness of the souls of those innocent
foreigners, whose blood has been let by crea
tures too low in our social scale to even enrich
the soil under which they v.ill eoon rest for all
eternity. May their resting place be forgot

bones to the surface as playthings for the

We are. all of us, natives of the Southland
and know all that is good of the foreigner; we
are a commercial race and we have learned by
contact. "We know that the white man does
not croea tho waters to murder us or steal our
children, and all of us who have liws in free
America have learned to respect its laws, its
institutions and the humane principles of the
people, all of which make this disgrace more
humlllatlner to bear.
Oceans separate us from the land where these
wicked deeds are being perpetrated," but Amer
ica has bIiIds and we have strength, which we
effer without reserve if we may be allowed to
follow your embjem of liberty wherever your
leaders "may. direct, and we promise to fight
till either the Boxers or the Reformers are no
more.
Resolutions are easily drawn by the holders
of seals and scholars of wit.* but war requires
courage and devotion to a Just cause. We offer
both to the nation under whose' protection we
have lived without fear for nearly half a cen
tury. Let America call, we are ready to aervo
her to the glorious end. B

LONDON APPROVES
THE ACTION OF THE
UNITED STATES
LONDON. July 2>. 4 a. m.â 'The
Washington idea of sending Mr.
Rxx-khi'.l to China," says the Stand
ard editorially this morning. "Is an
excellent one. and might advan
tageously be imitated by the British and
other Governments."
The Standard then proceeds to comment
upon the great ignorance prevailing In
Europe not only of recent events but of
Chinese affairs generally.
The Cabinet council convened by Lord
Salisbury yesterday came a day earlier
than usual, and it is expected that it will
be followed by a statement in Parliament
throwing light upon the situation. The
Chinese assertions that the members of
the foreign legations are still safe have
been so often repeated that they are again
beginning to raise hopes in forae quarters.
According to the Daily Telegraph's St.
Petersburg correspondent, however, the
Russian Government is already in posses
sion of definite news that all the foreign
ers in Peking were massacred on July 6.
XL Delcasses circular only goes to prove
that fo far the powers have failed to ar
rive at any concerted plan of action. The
Yokohama correspondent of- the Daily
Mr.il. who repeats his statements regard
ins The jealousy felt among the allies on
the subject of a Japanese Commander-in
chief and the general lack of unity among
them, adds:
"The Japanese correspondents charge
the Russian soldiers with appalling bar
barity toward the Chinese. They declare
that the Peiho is full of the corpses of
vomen and children and that the Russian,
loaded 300 bodies in a junk and burned
them."
Three Missions Destroyed
Shanghai reports that three mission
prations on Poyang Lake have been de
t-troyed. and It is believed that the mis
sionaries escaped. All the missionaries at
.\?:.'ho. Kerln and Kuanshengtseu, in
fhi:ies=e Manchuria, have arrived in safety
at Vladivostok.
It is ruir.oml that Tu Lu. the missing
Viceroy of the province of Chili, has com
rr.ittedFUlcide. Various conflicting stories
are published of the manner of General
Niehs death.
It is stated that when the allies entered
the native city of Tientsin they found the
Chinese dead piled breast high, and it
was feared that this would result in an
outbreak of pestilence. Sixteen of the cap
tured guns are quite modern weapons.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times expresses doubt that the southern
Viceroy* will be able to withstand the
pressure of the provincial officials to Join
the anti-foreign movement. He thinks
ihat already there are signs of wavering
/ n the part of the Viceroy of Nankin.
* :.iu Kun Yah. and says:
* "It is admitted at Nankin that Liu's
authority is now insufficient to guarantee
the raalnter.ar.ee of law and order north
of"tr:Â» river. Hence the Consuls at the
Yangtse ports are arranging for the de
parture of the women and children. It Is
inevitable that the mandarins as a body
should sympathize with Prince Tuan's
movements."
The correspondent confirms the state
ment of the correspondent of the Dally
Express regarding the indignation caused
by the British reception of Li Hung
Chang at Hongkong. He says It Is inter
preted by the natives as weakness on the
part of the allies, and he asks why Li
Hung Chang could rot have been detained
until information had been received from
Peking.
The Times understands that the chle*
representatives cf the Mohammedan
clergy in Constantinople' have Issued a
Ftrong- protest, based on the Koran,
against palace sympathy with the Chinese
massacres. According to the Canton cor
respondent cf the Daily Telegraph, six

Kill be largely influenced by the attitude of the United States.
China occupied the serious consideration of the Cabinet when It assembled
this morning. The suggestion that an international congress be called to dis
cuss the entire Chinese question has been favorably received in official quarters
here. Administration officials said to-day that the report that M. Delcasse, the
.French Minister of Foreign Affairs, had sent a circular note to the powers pro
posing an International agreement for Joint action In China and the future at
â¢ '.tude of tho powers was an error, though they Â¦would not deny that represen
; ations had been made by France and further questioning elicited the fact that
he proposition for convening an International congress was under consideration.
It was suggested that Mr. RockhHl's dispatch to Asia at this time may be
for the purpose of participating in an international conference to be held In the
Far East. Such conference will be entirely distinct from any congress that may
be called. The congress probably will meet in Berlin.

CITY CONTRACTS MUST
GO TO LOWEST BIDDER
Opinion of Judge Murasky in Deny
ing 1 an Order Agtuust Board of
Supervisors.
Judge Murasky yesterday refused to ls
rue the order asked by Harrison Barto
en behalf of Stanley, Taylor & Co. against
tho Board of Supervisors to show cause
vhy the board should not be prevented
from awarding contracts for city printing
to other* than the tirm named, which
claims to be the lowest bidder.
Judge Murasky iiled an opinion in which
he holds that the contracts alleged In the
complaint must certainly be given to the
lowest bidder, but discharges the Board
of Supervisors from the injunction com
pelling it to explain Its action In the prem-
Isei. The opinion says that If any Illegal
demands are presented for city "printing
by those who should not have received the
contract, then the Auditor and Treasurer
must .refuse to pay them. The llrm of
Stanley, Taylor Ar Co.. though the lowest
bidder for city printing, was not privi
leged to use the union label and for that
reason its bid was rejected.

The Country Club preserves, famous in

a score of well-known and affluent local
clubmen, will soon be deprived of 18,000
acres unless the club itself comes to the
front and bids a higher figure than that
offered by General John Dickinson and
John K. Orr. The land in question belongs
to the O. L. Shafter estate. In Marin
County, and constitutes the northern and
southern boundaries of the Country
Club's preserves. The figure that Dickin

Country Club desires to pay for the lease
of this land, and the members have de

The lease on these two sections of land

the preserves ot the Country Club ex

not imagined for a moment by the present
holders of the lease that any outside
party was desirous of renting this land
for hunting and rishing purposes. Great
was their surprise when It was discovered
that Dickinson and Orr had put In their
bid, which far exceeded the offer of the
Country Club. The highest bid was $600
annual rental and a guarantee to patrol
both sections of land. All told this aggre
gates an expense of $1SOO a year â a prepos
terous figure, say the Country Club men
and far In excess of possible valuable re
turns. For this reason the Country Club
has decided not to raise the bid and let it
go to the latest bidders. .
By obtaining the option of these sections
of land General Dickinson and Mr. Orr
deprive the Country Club of Its three
lakes. Trout. Bass and Crescent, which He

the lakes, as all the fiah obtainable In
them are grassy and cf such poor flavor
as to make them unpalatable and ob
noxious even to 'the tyro trout-eater. In
fact, they smile at General Dickinson and
his new venture In the acquisition of a
happy hunting and llshlng ground. The
sections on which he has bid are separ

Contempt Proceedings Be
fore Judge Murasky
Postponed.
Â»
Chief of Police Sullivan and Captain of
Detectives Seymour were up before Super
ior Judge Murasky last evening on an or
der to show cause why they should not be
punished for contempt in violating the In
junction of the court which provided that
police officers should not enter the pool
rooms of II. E. Corbett and others. The
hearing was postponed one week.
Attorney Joseph F. Coffey appeared for
the officers of the Police Department and
stated that, while he was not ready to
proceed with the hearing, he would as
sure the court that the order was not be
ing violated. Afterward Chief Sullivan, In
explanation of what the attorney had
said, stated that he had not issued orders
to his officers to pay no attention to the
order of the court, as had been stated.
The order is directed against ollicers re
maining In the pool rooms and waiting
for a crime to be committed. The Chief
claimed that his officers had the rights of
other citizens to go. In. and out of the pool
rooms. Ills orders to them were to go in
and out, but not to stand around, he said.
However, as there were two men sta
tioned at each poolselling: place, they so
contrived that when one officer stepped
out the other entered the place.
Judge Murasky took the case up first
at 5 o'clock In the afternoon. Chief Sulli
van and Captain Seymour were then pres
ent with District Attorney Byington and
Attorney Coffey. The affidavits of H. E.
Corbett, Henry Schwartz, Zick Abrams
and D. J. Crowley, poolsellers, were read.
These documents recited the order pro
hibiting the police entering the poolrooms,
and. "on July IS. the two defendants act
ing together did willfully and deliberately
and in open and contemptuous disobedi
ence of the restraining order of the court,
enter into and occupy without the con
sent, and against the express protest of
each of said plaintiffs, the premises de
scribed and interfered with their quiet
and peaceable possession. That the de
fendants maintained two police officers In
each of said premises against the objec
tion of the plaintiffs."
Attorney Coffey read the affidavits of
Chief Sullivan and Captain Â¦ Seymour,
which contained specific denials of the af
fidavits sworn to by the poolroom people,
upon which the order to show cause was
based. Coffey outlined the- defense by
questioning the court's Jurisdiction and
saying that even if it had jurisdiction the
point to.be decided was whether the In
structions issued by the Chief of Police
came within the exceptions of the prelim
inary injunction.
, The affidavits stated that the poolroom
men had been arrested for, violation of the
two ordinances passed â¢ by the Board of
Supervisors which prohibit the- selling oX
CHIEF SULLIVAN
DENIES THAT HE
HAS DISOBEYED
pools on contests between horse3 and
men; that signs were openly displayed In
the premises occupied by Corbett and
other pool sellers, showing that they were
engaged in the business of pool selling:
that Chief Sullivan's orders were that if
the premises were not used as private
premises and If the police witnessed any
violation of the said ordinances they were
to arrest those who violated the law. The
instructions had been carried out on tho
belief that the ordinance had been vio
lated.
After some further argument a recess
was taken until 7:30 p. m.
Before the court convened last evening
Attorney Coffey had a conference with
Attorney George B. Collins, who repre
sents the pool men and they came to the
conclusion that, even If they were to take
the entire night, they could not get
through with the case. To-day Judge
Murasky goes on a two weeks' vacation.
Accordingly Attorney Coffey suggested to
the court that the ease be postponed for
a fortnight. Attorney Collins was will
ing, provided the police were kept out of
the poolrooms In the meantime. It was
then that the attorneys got into a wran
gle.
Coffey insisted on the continuance, on
the ground that he had fifteen police offi
cers to call as witnesses and that It wouid
be impossible to get through before the
court's legal vacation commenced.
"A continuance Is satisfactory to me.**
paid Collins, "but I cannot consent that
In the meantime my clients* places of
business shall remain "full of policemen
when no crime Is being committed there " :
"Perhaps it may bo shown." suggested
Coffey. "that the officers are there con
trary to the Chief's orders. I can assure
the court that we are prepared to show
that the Chief has not Issued orders In
violation of the court's injunction "
"I am in no position to connive* at a
continuance of these violations." retorted
Collins, "for such thej- are. as I am pre
pared to show. I am prepared to proceed
The prosecution has an easy case to nre
sent. If there are renewed violations to
morrow I hhall have to institute contempt
proceedings before some other Judee "
The court called a halt on this sort of
proceeding and was about to continue the
matter for two weeks, when It was inter
rupted by Collins with the RUKKestion

PLEA FOR FRANCHISE
ON ILLINOIS STREET
Brothers of T. J. Kelly Offer Reward
for the Recovery of the
Two Bodies.
BELVEDERE. July 19.â After three
days of continuous search for some trace
of Tobias J. Kelly and Miss Bessie War
ren, who left Belvedere In a catboat on
Sunday and have not been seen since.
John and Thomas Kelly, the two brothers
of the m!=?ing rnan, have had the follow
ing notice distributed among captains of
river and bay craft, copies being also sent
wherever they may bo of any use:
The brothers of Tobias J. Kelly ofTer a re

But little was done to-day In the way
of searching-. To-morrow, however, Ly

The catboat sink, will be dragged again,
despite the faiinre of yesterday's efforts
to reveal any trace of the supposed vic
tims. The reason for the resumption of
the fparch Is that the oar found a.t Point
Richmond yesterday was positively Identi
fied t<>-<lny by Attorney Harry P. Dlmond,
who sold the catboat to Kelly, as being
one of the pair in the boat at the time
or the lamentable tHp. A strong current
pets direct from Racoon Straits to Point
Richmond. Any floating object lost In the
Ftralts would be cast ashore at Point
Richmond. It Is for this reason that the
Kt'lly brothers will once more drag Rac
coon StraitB for evidence of a disaster.
A report came to young William War
ren to-day that a boat answering to the
description of the one in which Kelly and
Miss Warren sailed away had been found
by some Chinese clam diggers at Bay
ViÂ»?w. The repurt proved to be false.
Both the Kellys say now that they will
not let up r>n the search till every Inch of
bottom in Raccoon Straits has been drag
ged over.
OAR BELONGING TO THE

same place. The two cans, covered as
they were, were evidently Intended to
carry a supply of fresh water. The pres
ence of the Inflated rubber bag suggests
the Idea that the men Intended to cross
the marsh and thought they might need
a life preserver. Each, was provided with
a small tightly corked bottle of matches.
After the men reached the roof of the
building a few minutes after 2 o'clock in
tho morning they wc-nt to the north end
and threw the hooked end of thefr rope
across the alley to the railing on the wall,
a distance of about forty feet.
The lead on ! the hook made it wrap
around the rail. They then tied their
end of the rope around the chimney, and
gathering their effects swung out over the
alley, the pavement of. which was fifty
feet below. They worked themselves
along the line until they reached the wall
from which they jumped to the ground
below.
Guard Lee Carpenter, who was on the
wall, saw them as they jumped. They
ran up the hill to the north of the prison.
Johnson being in the lead. Carpenter
took a long shot at Healy and brought

Johnson continued to run up the hill, and
ran against Guard Sam Randolph. Ran
dolph brought his rifle to bear on John
sen, who threw up his hands, and was
taken back to the prison. Healy was
taken to the hospital, where It Is said he
vvill recover.
Healy said "that he wanted to congrat
ulate Carpenter on his quickness as a
shot. He said that he never believed a
man could shoot so quick. The instant the
first shot was fired the alarm bell was
rung and in less than two minutes over
sixty guards lined the hills and roads;
some of them wore only their undercloth
ing, but all had their rifles. Warden
Agulrre thanked his men warmly for
their promptness and discipline.
"Warden Agulrre says that at no time
during the trouble was there a sound from
the other convicts.
A large butcher .knife was found In the
grass where the men got over the wall,
having been dropped by one of them in

be determined to get away or die In the
attempt.
It was Just 2:21 a. m. when Guards Car
penter and Randolph discovered the two
striped figures on the roof of the old his
pital building, in which Johnson and
Healy were quartered. Subsequent inves
tigation showed that the men had broken
through the celling of their cell. thu3
gaining access to the roof. By means of
a rope they lowered themselves to tho
railing of the wall, some forty feet below,
and then sprang to the ground. Healy
received eleven buckshot In his body from
the gun of Guard Carpenter.
Both Johnson and Healy have records
as desperate characters. Johnson Is serv
ing a life sentence from Los Angeles for
train robbery, having been a partner of
the notorious "Kid" Thompson, who was
at one time under sentence of death, but
secured a new trial and is now serving a
life sentence at Folsom. Johnson has been
employed as a cook at the prison for some
time past. Healy is serving a life sentence
for a murder and robbery committed at
Long Beach, Los Angeles County. In isr*r>.
He has been a steward in the prison hos
pital for some years.
Uoth of the convicts have been In deli
cate health and for that reason were given
the lightest employment possible. The
men occupied a room or cell In what Is
known as the hospital building. Some
time durinK the night they cut a hole in
the ceiling of their cell. It is probable
that the work was accomplished in a short
space of time, as the. structure Is rather
light and not calculated to resist much
force. >>
The two convicts had made elaborate
preparations for their break for freedom.
Twine from the JuUunill had been secured
. and carefully braided into a 43-foot rope.
To the end of the rope was attached a
stout hook made of heavy wire and wound
with string to prevent a noise and also
weighted with lead so that it mi^ht be
, easily thrown. Next the Ingenious jail
breakers secured two hot water cans from
the hospital and covered them with pieces
of blanket and canvas. They also secured
a large rubber hot water bag from the

REDWOOD CITY, July 13.â Testimony
in the prelimirary examination of Le
mascher, Ehlors and Gayer, accused of
murdering Mrs. Mitchell and her son Da
vid at Colma on the evening of July
4, did not bring forth to-day anything that
differed materially from the evidence
given at the Coroner's Inquest. The only
difference was in the testimony of Mitch
ell, who said he Is now not quite sure
that Ehlc-rs is the man whose shot took
effect In the dog. Throughout the exam
ination Mitchell retained composure, in
marked contrast to his attitude at the
Inquest.
Constable Neville testified that when he
hed been Informed of the murders on the
evening of July 4 he Immediately went to
the scene, and on the way stopped at Im
sand'e for tho purpose of verifying the
report of the shooting. Not being able to
arouse the.Imsands he started for Mitch
ell's, when he heard talking at the house
he had just left. Returning quickly, he
found lyemascher and Ehlers In close com
munication, but they denied all knowledge
of the shooting.
Dr. Ross, the autopsy physician, testi
fied that he :lrst examined the body of :
Mrs. Mitchell and found that the bullet
hud pierced both lunps. Heath was caused
in both cases by shock and hemorrhage.
Deputy Coroner Fox said thRt with
Sheriff Mansfield he fcjund the bodies of
the Mitchells lying near the hog pen. In
his judgment a bullet that had entered
tlio Mitchell hottse came from the direc
tion of Inland's. The testimony of Fox
was corroborated for the most part by
Sheriff Mansfield.
Haehman. the San Francisco gunsmith, |
said Lemasrhor and a companion had
bought from him two S2-40 rifles and
cartridges, but could not swear that these
ri!les were identical with those found on
the impnnd place.
The last witness? of the day was Mitch
ell, who retold his ptory of the shooting.
He was on the stand nearly an hour and
answered all the questions of the attor
neys readily. His testimony was Bub
ptantlally the f-ame as that given at the
Inquest. The examination was continued
until to-morrow at l'.> o'clock. j

The killing of a prisoner while attempt

elsewhere. Two shots were fired at him.
but he made good his attempt. A guard
was sent In pursuit, but Carroll succeeded
in eluding them. Carroll's offense was a
serious one, Rnd had he not succeeded in
escaping he would probably have spent
several years at Alcatraz.

NEW YORK, July 13.â The twenty
eighth annual regatta of the National As
sociation of Amateur Oarsmen was com
menced to-day under the auspices of the
Harlem Regatta Association. The course
was on the Harlem River, between Fcrd
fcam Heights landing and Washington
tiride, a distance of one and a half miles,
straightaway. The weather was to the
liking of the competitors, but a strong
breeze blew directiy against the oarsmen,
â¢which made fast time out of the question.
Of the six races rowed to-day, threeâ
the International fours, a heat of the in
termediate singles and the pair-oared
ehtJl race â were rowed with the incoming
tide. The intermediate doubles' first heat,
the senior cight-oared shells and the Paris
four shells were rowed against the out
going tide.
About 1",OX> persons lined the river
banks near the finish. The rirst event was
the international four-oared shell race.
The starters were the Wachusett Boat
C"lub of Worcester, Mafs., and the Detroit
Boat Club of Detroit. The Wachusett
crev.- tv?.s stroked by E. H. Ten Eyck. the
ex-Henley champion, who introduced his
tcuiling 8tyle of sweep rowing. The
Wcchusetts were the Jirst to catch the
water. After a few strokes, however, the-
Detroits drÂ« 5 w level and then commenced
a rare tussle. B<>th crews steered badly,
but of the two the Wachusetts were the
worse, and if they should commit the
FamÂ« mistake- in the Paris regatta they
will land clear up on the bank of the river
Seine. At the mile the crews were about
level, but by sheer plugging the Wachu
setts f',rg<-ii ahf-ad and finally won by two
and m half lengths of open water.
Joseph Nial. a slim youngster from the
Laureate Boat Club of Troy, secured a
df-rivive win in the first heat of the lnter
irjf-diate singles.
The pair-oared shells was a veritable
gift for Exleh and Busche of the Vesper
Boat Club of Philadelphia. The crews
had hprdlv rowc-d three hundred yards
vihfi) the Qufikers wfr<- in front about two
lengths, and going along In splendid style
they crossed the line about twelve lengths
nh'-ad of the Detroit Boat Club. The
Cokmi of New York were the only other
or<-w in this race.
The last race was the Paris fours, the
competitors again being the Wachusetts
and Detrolts. The Wachusetts won by
ebout a Length, and the victory entitled
them to a trip to the Paris Exposition at
the expense of the National Association
Of AmaUur Oarsmen.

OARSMEN OF
AMERICA ROLD
THEIR REGATTA
LONDON'. July 19.-William Waldorf
Astor has apparently reached the conclu
sion that he made a grave blunder when
he publicly insulted Captain Sir Archibald
Berkley Milne. To-day Mr. Astor pub
lishes In his newspaper, the Pall Mall
Gazette:
"We Oe<=ire to express regret that a
paragraph which appeared In this column
July 2 with regard to the presence of Sir
Berkley Milne at* Mr. Astor's concert the
preceding Thursday evening should have
been published under a misapprehension
of the exact circumstances. Explanations
of a complete categorical kind now show
that Sir lierkley Milne's presence was due
to a misunderstanding that entirely ab
solves him. from any Intentional discour
tesy."
Mr. Astor's apology was without doubt
forced by the action of the Prince of
Wales, who, when the matter was placed
before him. unhesitatingly expressed his
Indignation and declared that unless an
ample apology was forthcoming Mr. Astor
could not bt- permitted to retain member
ship in the Marlborough Club. The Prince
of Wales' views were conveyed to the
club committee and Mr. Astor was noti
fied that an apology alone could save him
from being expelled. Though this apology
Is now forthcoming and Mr. Astor has
narrowly escaped the ignominy of public
expulsion from thf> club. It is widely as
serted that his forced repentance will not
save him from being cold-shouldered by
all who are not dazzled by his wealth.
It Is Asserted His Forced Repentance

Cold-Shouldered by Many

Special Dispatch to The Call
VALLEJO. July 19.â The third day of
the race meeting was liberally attended
and the major portion of those present at
the track were dressed in their betting
clothes. The sport, with one exception,
was above mediocrity, but a strong wind
again caused the watches to record no
very fast time, which was regrettable, as
the surface of the course is how begin
ning to wear a velvety look.
The 2:14 pace was responsible for the
defeat of William Harold, a son of Sid
ney, which sold a pronounced favorite in
the overnight betting. After taking the
first heat like breaking eggs, Harold
plainly dogee- it, and John A, splendidly
driven by J. M. Xelson, wiggled off three
very becoming heats, securing the long
end of the purse. The special for stern
wheelers of the 2:1S class was a catching
operetta of five acts that dragged consid
erably toward the end, In which the he
roine eventually turned up in Miss Barna
bee. In the running number El Mldo
downed his field handily, while Zurich, by
taking the sprint, caused the bookies to
shudder.
Betting on the pace was not brisk, be
ing confined chiefly to small wagers on
the result of heats. William Harold ruled
an even money chance for the first, and
led Bernard and Wilhelmina over the line
so impressivelv that he had a stanch fol
lowing to take the heat following. To the
surprise of all, John A, the 4 to 1 outsider
of the sldewheel quartet, hooked up with
Harold in the stretch and in a drive was
first by a head in 2:13%. Big things were
expected of Bernard in the tnlrd heat, but
John A repeated the trick, reaching home
a length before the horse from Southern
California. The latter made a bold bid
(for the fourth and deciding heat, but,
after being cut off just betore striking
the stretch, lost at the close by two open
lengths. Driver Whitney entered a pro
test, claiming a foul against the heat
winner, which was disallowed by the
stand.
Beyond doubt the special was broken
into many parts. Twilight, Juan Chico
and Miss Barnabee all taking heats. The
whole affair was taken as a joke even by
the bookmakers, who were not caught
napping.
Seven to ten looked a long price against
El Mido in the betting on the mile run.
due preatly to the support accorded Lit
tle Sister and Romany. Sister, the 2 to 1
second choice, lfd until well into the
stretch, where Gaffney shook the first
choice up, and he won with considerable
to spare. Romanv was third.
Humphrey & Co. received a jarring over
the result of the five-furlong scramble.
Zurich, with M. Nichols up and 6 to 1 in
the opening betting, headed Harry Gwynne
in the run to the stand, winning by a
couple of lengths in 1:01. Gwynne beat
the gate, but was unable to last. Whit
comb, the favorite, and Candlelight II,
another short-priced one, were left at the

HAROLD, THE
FAVORITE, LOSES
TO FAST JOHN A
GEORGETOWN, Ky., July 19.â The
case of Caleb Powers, charged with
complicity in the Goebel assassination,
opened to-day with a long legal debate
on the questt6n of the admisslblllty of
matters transpiring between the date of
the shooting of Senator Goebel and his
death. The point was raised by a
question put by the prosecution to
Witness Culton regarding a conversa
tion between him and Youtsey before
Goebel died. The court ruled that this
evidence must be excluded.
In regard Jo- the preparations for
bringing the big crowd of mountain
eers to Frankfort, witness said Powers
told those in the conference that In the
event of any trouble growing out of the
importation of the men the leaders
would be indicted for conspiracy, and
were asked if they were willing to take
the risk. In the discussion of tne ques
tion of transportation witness said
Henry Painter, a Mlddlesboro railroad
lawyer, suggested that trains be captured
on several roads.
Culton said he boarded the mountaineer
excursion at Richmond. He said Charles
Finley had told him to go there and come
down with the men, as Powers was not
needed. He was told to tell the men to
announce on their arrival that they had
come only to petition the Legislature.
Advised to Be Cautious.
After the assassination Powers came
to witness and told him to write to the
parties who were in the conference and
tell them they had better be very care
ful and do no talking, as they were
liable to be connected with the murder.
Witness told him it would be dangerous
to write- and Powers said he would do
it himself. The prosecution produced a
box of cartridges for witness to Inspect.
He said the cartridges were like those
Youtsey showed ntm when talking
about killing Goebel.
Powers gave witness badges for the
mountain men who remained at Frank
fort. They were issued so that in case
of trouble they could distinguish their
own men from others. The badges con
tained a picture of Governor Taylor
Witness said that while in jail with
Powers at Frankfort Powers begged
him not to go on the witness stand in
the hearinp of the motion for bail. Wit
ness told Powers he wanted to get ball
as his family needed him. Powers told
him he would see to it that his family
was provided for if witness would agree
not to go on the stand. Witness declined
to do so.
"Is it not true that you used over $1000
belonging to the funds in your charge
while a clerk in the Auditor's office and
that Auditor Stone was compelled to make
your shortage jjood?" asked the counsel
for defense.
"It Is not true. I was not short In any
amount, and Auditor Stone did not have
to pay anything on my account."
Culton was asked about visiting Colonel
Campbell and ethers of the prosecution.
He denied that he had been promised im
munity. He admitted that he did not tell
Campbell the truth when he said that he
told all he knew, but. as a matter of fact
he told just as much as he was forced to
tell.
Testimony at Variance.
Witness said that in becoming a witness
In the Powers case now on trial and in
tellinpr all he knew he is following the ad
vice of his father. Judge Culton. The de
fense then atempted to show an intimacy
between Culton and the prosecution, and
that a discrimination was beiner made be
tween Culton and the other defendants.
Mr. Owens asked a number of questions
to show that the testimony given by Cul
ton on the stand to-day and yesterday was
at variance on some points with that
plven in his application for bail at Frank
fort. Witness said he had omitted some
things in his testimony, but that he had
not done so intentionally. His memory
had been refreshed by the questioning of
the lawyers, and this recalled the addi
tional matter he had told.
The cross-examination was continued in
the afternoon session. He was asked to
again relate the conversation between him
and ex-Governor Bradley regarding a re
port that Goebel was to be killed. Brad
ley told witness he understood that twen
ty men had been picked for that purpose
and said: "That must not be under anv
circumstances."
He was asked If Powers did not come to
him after the assassination and ask him if
he knew anything that would lead to the
discovery of the assassin. Witness could
not recall such a conversation. Culton
concluded his testimony at 2:30 p m.
Silas Jones cf Whitley County, who went
with the mountaineers to Frankfort and
remained there until after the assassina
tion, was the next witness.
Jones was in the executive building
when the shooting occurred. The Â«shots
sounded to him to come from the Secre
tary of State's office. Prior to the shoot
ing the witness was In Governor Taylor's
office. The Governor asked him why he
was not in the House lobby. Witness re
plied that he did not want to go up there
as he was not armed. He added- "The
Governor asked why In the hell I had
come there without arms and said I had
as well go home."
After the shooting Jones was arrested
as a suspect but was released, the Grand
Jury falling to Indict.

Cuba.*! independent government Is to be
organized and the withdrawal of the
United States from the Island is to be ae<
ccmplifhe-i. within -nine months. This Is
the extreme limit which administration
officials now pet for the continuance of
American military control of the Island.
The situation in Cuba and the pro
pnrame to be carried out by the United
States v;ct9 considered to-day at a meet-
Ing of the Cabinet and at a luncheon in
the White House, which was participated
In by the President, members of the Cab
inet and Major General Wood, who went
over the situation In Cuba with the Pres
ident and Cabinet as fully asÂ»he did with
Secretary of War Root yesterday.
General Wood Impressed his hearers
with his conviction that matters in Cuba
were in a satisfactory condition and that
there would be no difficulty al>out the
gradual withdrawal of troops. It is not
the intention of the administration to re
duce the military force in Cuba below rÂ»noO
men until after the general elections for
delegates to the constitutional conven
tion. This election will be held before the
end of October and will be the next step
in thÂ« direction of the formation of the
Cuban Government. The convention will
assemble as t^oon as possible after the
election, and the future of the Cubans will
then be in tholr own hands, as organiza
tion of their independent government and
the date when it is to assume its duties
and responsibilities will depend very
largely on the action of this convention.
It is expected that the convention will
frame a constitution modeled very larKely
on that of the United States. It \IM pro
vide for elections to fill the various ofllces
created, and ns soon as these elections
have been held and new officials in
stalled the T'nited States will finally with
draw. It is thought this can be done in
about nine months. It is realized by the
administration that there are many ad
vocates of annexation of Cuba, both in
the island and in the United States. There
nre strong advocates of annexation among
high ofHcials of the administration, but no
pressure is to be exerted on Cubans in the
United States. Annexation may como
finally, but it Is not expected that It will
come without a period of independence.
The commercial advantages that can be
secured by Cubans by political union with
the T'nited States will probably build up
a strong party of annexationlsts in the
Islnnds.

mittee appointed a year ago to report en the
commercial outlook of the South. Speeches
were made by T>. A. Tompktns of North Caro-

home office to Portland, Or., and take 500 people
away from San Francisco. This suggests that the time
is opportune for telephone sufferers to petition the di
rectors of the monopoly to include some of its im
pudent "hello girls" among the emigrants.
The bunko industry appears to have been revived

say, was made thousands of miles from Washington.

A FEW days ago in pointing out the importance
of pledging ail legislative candidates this year
to the enactment next winter of some well de
vised law looking toward the preservation of forests,
The Cail stated that ?mple object lessons in the form
of fires would be forthcoming during the summer to
enforce upon the public mind the need of such legis
lation. One of those lessons has now blazed out in
the sugar pine belt, and from the reports that come to
us it appears a very disastrous one indeed.
A dispatch from Placcrvillc of yesterday in de
scribing the fire states that up to that time it ha-J
already destroyed a lcrge acreage of trees and much
other property of value. The forests swept by the
rlames are in the heart of the sugar pine belt and con
tain some of the finest timber in the world. The
total amount of the direct loss will be difficult to cal
culate, while that of Hie indirect loss is absolutely
incalculable, since it is going to affect not only the
owners of the woods that were burned but the whole
community whose trade and industries are in any
way connected with the timber interests.
After this fire others will come. From week to
week, and Â£t certain periods perhaps from day to day,
during the dry season we shall have to chronicle fire
fire, sweeping over pastures or forests, in one
part of the State or another. Mountain and valley
dike will suffer from the scourge. The total cost to
the State of the disasters will exceed the amount
which would be imposed upon us by taxation to sup
port a great war. What will the people do about it'
We talk of economy, we demand lower taxes, we
ask for strictly business methods of managing State
:.fTairÂ«, and yet we permit a waste of woods
in comparison with which the waste by parties is as
rothing. To support forest fires we impose upon our
natural resources a tax so heavy we can hardly count
it up. If we are going to have a businesslike regard
icr our prosperity and welfare, let us begin to exer
cise it this winter to the extent of making at least an
earnest attempt to d;vise a good and scientific plan
for the prevention of forest fires.
FIRE IN THE SUGAR PINES
General Miles says he would go to China if he were
sssured of supreme command of all the allied forces,

courteous.
ONE MORE TICKET TO COME.
AT the last tally there were ten Presidential
tickets in the field, and now we are promised
another. The Gold Democrats who sup
ported Palmer and Buckner four years ago
have about decided to do the right thing and vote the
straight Republican ticket this year, but the anti
imperialists who cannot follow Bryan will, it is said,
fill the vacancy by the nomination of an independent,
anti-imperial, gold-standard, go-as-you-please ticket,
for the purpose of affording candidates to all persons
who do not like to vote with the crowd. \
In a dispatch from Washington Wednesday it was
stated that ex-Senator Edmunds is expected to take
a leading part in organizing the new movement, but
that expectation is in the nature of an air plant, for
it has no ground for existence. Edmunds has in an
open letter already declared an intention to support
McKinley. It was also stated that efforts are being
made to induce ex-President Cleveland to join the
combination and take an active part in launching it,
but no intimation was given of any intention on his
part to do so. Finally it was added: "The main re
liance of the promoters of the independent ticket is
the strong Democratic element in New York, New
Jersey. Pennsylvania and the New England States,
which will not go to Bryan on account of silver Jjnd is
not prepared to support the Republican ticket on ac
count of imperialism, so called. A similar condition
of things exists in Indiana and other parts of the
West."
The nomination of the projected ticket would of
course add something to the spice of the campaign,
for it would be a variety, but the amount added would
be so small no one would ever know it was there
from the general flavor of the mass. The people are
not going to throw away their votes in an election
of such importance as this. Sincere opponents of so
called '"imperialism" will vote for McKinley on the
sound and broad ground that it is to the Republican
party only intelligent men can look for a wise solu
tion of any of the problems of the country, or for a
safe administration of its routine governmental work.
Senator Hoar, who stands among the foremost
opponents of any plan for the annexation of the Phil
ippines, has well expressed the sentiments of a vast
majority of such opponents in his recent letter to
Erving Winslow. in the course of which he said:
"If you think you can best help the cause of liberty
and true Republicanism by voting for the men who
are for the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1; by voting
for men who are for refusing 10,000,000 American
citizens suffrage at home, for overthrowing the inds-
IT is reported that Mr. Tarpey, in an interview with
Colonel Bryan, advised him to give up hope of
carrying California. This may be taken as evi
dence of Mr. Tarpey's political foresight, and it may
r.ot. It may be a bit of very astute tactics to disarm
Republican appreher?ion and spread among tho
bosses and political machinists the idea that it is a
yellow dog year.
Already those who .vatch the signs see evidence
tl\at. whatever Mr. Tarpey meant, he is taken as hav
ing .meant that this is a year for a Republican walk
ovw in California, and the parasites and bosses are
gfttinc; ready to do the walkover for their own benefit.
Republicans who are interested not merely in party
success but in party character do not believe in the
walkover idea, and deny that any year is a yellow dog
year, since the party i? not a yellow dog party.
Already this upright class of Republicans have no
ticed the signs of Democratic activity and organiza
tion. If Mr. Tarpey, member of the National Com
mittee, really believed California hopeless for his
party, does any one believe that all this elaborate
and costly party machinery would be provided and set
in motion?
Republicans should be admonished by the well
established reputation of California for erratic politics
i.nd by the non-fcalty shown last year by the Repub
licans of San Francisco. The party must not respond
10 the widespread preparations of the Democracy
â¢with widespread indifference. Every inch gained
against boss control mu?t be held and added to, and
everything must be done to face a stern independent
\ etc and a wary and alert opposition. Unless this is
<5onc, the wily Mr. Tarpey may be caught laughing in
hÂ«Â£ sleeve when the vote is counted.
HOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA?
THE WATER FRONT SCANDALS
ONCE more The Call in the course of its service
to the public has exposed a wrong of grave
proportions and prepared the way for apply
ing a remedy and punishing the wrongdoers. The
story published yesterday of the manner in which a
number of workingmen were induced to pay consid
erable sums of money in consideration of getting em
ployment under the Harbor Commission brings to
light a fraud whose scandal comes close to persons in
official position, and is of such magnitude as to ren
der imperative an immediate investigation by the
Grand Jury.
â¢ By the evidence The Call has made public the facts
are established that nine workingmen of the city paid
to E. D. Wilbur $50 in cash each, and another paid
him $40. In addition to the cash payments each of
the ten gave Wilbur two promissory notes for $25
each. The consideration in each and all of the pay
ments was that Wilbur should obtain for the payer a
position and employment under the Harbor Commis
sion. These facts are attested not 'only by the testi
mony of the men who paid the money, but by docu
mentary evidence. Thus, for example, there was pub
lished among the exhibits in The Call of yesterday a
receipt given by Wilbur to Ferren for $40, in which
it is expressly stated: "I, the undersigned, agreed to
get him a position under the Harbor Commission, and
by my failure to do so I will return the said forty dol
lars ($40) to the aforesaid Jno. L. Ferren by August
fifteenth (15), 1899â and it is further agreed that this
is strictly confidential up to the date named." The re
ceipt is signed E. D. Wilbur.
In addition to the evidence of the receipts there is
a complete acknowledgment of the whole case by
Wilbur in an affidavit, which was also published. In
his affidavit Wilbur makes a clear and full statement.
He names the men .from whom he received the
money, specifies the amount paid by each in cash and
the amounts of the promissory notes, and asserts he
collected the money from them "with the understand
ing that each one should receive a position upon the
water front under the Board of State Harbor Com
missioners, or that the money so collected would be
refunded in case said position was not obtained as
promised."
That settles the case so far as Wilbur is concerned,
but he had more to say. His affidavit continues:
"I had spoken to one Ed Conroy in regard to placing
some men on the front, stating that the}' were willing
to put up some money for campaign purposes, and
he readily assented on a limited number of carpenters,
to placing these men, on the putting up of $50 each in
cash and two note? for $25 each, payable one and two
months respectively after their obtaining positions.
I was led to believe at all times that the positions were
secure and that there would be no doubt of the truth
fulness of Conroy's word concerning said positions.
As soon as I had collected from Well and every one
of said persons hereinbefore named, I turned the
money so collected immediately over to Air. Conroy,
who gave no receipt and had instructed me to give
no receipt to the men for said money collected,
though I had given two receipts, one to Mr. Ferren
and one to Mr. Woods. Mr. Conroy had put me off
in various ways from time to time in placing the men.
All sorts of excuses were offered, until I found out he
was acting in bad faith. My object in making this
affidavit is to vindicate myself, because those who ad
vanced the money to me have demanded either the
money or the position as promised, and as I am in
no position to make good either, I desire to have the
burden of this matter rest where it properly belongs."
There is the case and the evidence The Call has
obtained and which it submits to the Grand Jury for
investigation. Wilbur admits taking the money in
payment for water-front positions, and seeks to vin
dicate himself by asserting that the money was paid
to Conroy, and that Conroy agreed to get the men the
positions paid for. It is for the Grand Jury and the
courts to decide whether or no Wilbur's charge be
true.
Demanding payment from workingmen for posi
tions under the Harbor Commission, even when to
the original offense of the sale of such positions there
is added the further wrong of defrauding the pur
chasers, is not so great an evil as the wholesale loot
ing of the estates of the dead such as The Call ex
posed in the Chretien case, but it is fully as mean.
The one is as black .1 scandal upon our political sys
tem as the other upon the practices of our probate
system. It is therefore the duty of the Grand Jury to
enter upon this investigation with a resolution, to
bring the whole fraud into light with all of its roots
and branches, let them reach where they may. It is
hardly likely that the ten men involved in this case
are the only workers who have been compelled to
pay tribute to spoilsmen for the sake of getting jobs.
A comprehensive investigation may bring other
wrongs of the kind to light, and if the Grand Jury
succeed in exposing the whole ring it will render .i
service that will be of immense benefit to the com
munity and long memorable in our annals.

pendence of the Supreme Court, and for destroying
the safeguards of property and American labor, very
well. Go your way and do your duty as you see it.
I shall do mine as I see it, and I think I can best do
it by speaking as a Republican to Republicans; by
keeping my right to speak as a counselor and asso
ciate of the men who have wrought everything that
hasbeen wrought for liberty in this country since the
treaty of peace in 1783, and not as- the associate or
through the instrumentality of the party or men who
have been ranged for sixty years on the side of
despotism and oppression, of dishonor and of low
.wages."
That is the way the issue will appear to the people
at large. There are row ten tickets in the field, but
only two of them count, and the addition of an
other to the whole number will not alter the -fact tlict
it is through one' of those two the country is to be
governed. He that is not for McKinley is for Bryan.
An anti-imperial ticket is no more needed in this
campaign that a fifth wheel to a wagon.
ThjE PEKING LYNCHINGS.
THERE seems little ground for hoping that the
foreigner* in Peking have escaped massacre.
The details of the slaughter were no doubt ap
palling, and they will lose nothing in the telling to
the outside world. We think, however, that a mis
lake will be made if the nations attempt to treat these
slaughters as the act of the Chinese Government, as
:i national lather than an individual crime. The mur
ders have evidently been in spite of that Government.
Of this the briefest examination will satisfy any can
did mind. Concerned in the government of China
are many astute statesmen. They know international
law as well as any professor in the Occident. They
know the enormity oi the official slaughter of a for
eign Minister. They know that when war occurs
between two nations ench gives the diplomatic repre
sentative of the other a safe conduct across its fron
tier to neutral territory. They know that violence to
the person of a diplomat is" violence to the nation that
accredits him, and if done by authority, as an act of
the Government, is the highest form of offense. '
Now, knowing all these things, it is by no mlans
likely that official China in any way connived at or
was responsible for these deplorable crimes. They
were, in effect, lynchings, on a scale greater than our
lynchings of foreigners and people of other races in
this country.
The Chinese Government is under international
obligations to protect the persons of the foreign Min
isters, and its treaty obligations compel it to protect
foreigners who are upon its soil under treaty grant.
The Boxer uprising was apparently not against for
eigners alone, but against the Chinese Government,
because it sought to observe and keep its international
and treaty obligations. The Government was over
powered, in fact, by a sudden and gigantic rebellion,
which we have no doubt received much of its stiÂ»cngth
from^the ill-advised landing of foreign troops, which
seemed to the people like an invasion with permanent
occupation behind it. As that Government was un
able to discharge its international obligations, it must
make adequate reparation to the nations whose people
have suffered. So far not Germany, nor Russia, nor
any other nation, has cause of war upon China. The
crimes committed are not national crimes. -None of
the Governments has any right to demand territory
as any part of the indemnity which they have the right
to ask. They have the right to demand payment of
money indemnity, and such national humiliation as
they choose in the way of granting garrison privi
leges for defense of the legations in future, but to de
mand territory is quite another thing.
If China refuse any reparation demanded within
proper limits, that refusal will be a brazen admission
of Government responsibility for the crimes, an<i they
then become an act of war, and China must take\vhat
ever consequences follow, even to conquest of terri
tory.
It is necessary to keep these principles in view, be
cause Germany is showing a disposition to treat what
has been done as an act of the Government, and pro
ceed at once with war against China. It is probable
that her view may be supported by Russia. But it is
not probable that both will feel able to disjoint from
the United States and England. On Chinese soil there
arc 80,000,000 men of age and able to bear arms.
The assault upon such a nation is a serious under
taking, and all the Governments concerned, if in
concert, may well pause before sounding the tocsin.
There has been a pitiful self-deception as to China.
The easy victory of Japan is responsible for many
things that are among the causes of the existing situ
ation. The Western nations were greedy to take ad
vantage of the weakness which that war seemed to
demonstrate. So there rapidly accumulated provoca
tions to be added to what has been growing ever
since the Anglo-French looting of Peking forty years
ago.
As a matter of fact the war with Japan was carried
on, inefficiently, by one province only, and there are
hundreds of millions of Chinese who have never heard
of it.
They have all heard, however, of the foreign aggres
sions which followed it, and are simply applying the
lessons which have been taught them by other races.
American mobs, for the time being too strong for
this Government, have slaughtered Chinese, have
burned them to death, under circumstances of terrible
cruelty, and since we, whose lives are lighted by wis
dom from on high, have done these things, we should
counsel patience among the nations whose people
have been made the victims of our example.

It Was No Trust.
When Melchoir Marti of this city died
he left an estate, and by his will he be
queathed all to his widow. He expressed a
"desire" that upon her death the widow
should bequeath one-half of the estate to
his relatives. In the Probate Court this
clause was regarded as a. trust proposi
tion, but the Supreme Court yesterday de
cided that it was not a trust.

THE CHRETIEN CASE.
STOCKTON' INDEPENDENT.
The service of the San Francisco Call
in probing the conspiracy to loot estates
in probate through attorneys of absent
heirs has earned for it the grratitude of
the public. The Chretien scandal is a
sorry mess to expose to the public gaze,
but such exposures are necessary as long
as the bar is cursed with conscienceless
hyenas hanging around to loot the dead.
OAKLAND ENQUIRER.
The matter of appointing "attorneys for
ahsent heirs" should receive a thorough
ventilation now that it has been suggested
by the Chretien exposure. The subject
will bear investigation, and if some of the
Judges suffer in reputation as a conse
quence they will have only themselves to
blame. In Alameda County as much as
$6000 has been allowed to an attorney for
absent heirs, even when no one could per
ceive that he had rendered service of any
value.

and other interesting features concisely
and admirably depicted.

weary convalescents from the hospitals
out for a lonely airing, at a night attck.
in the trenches, in the splendid church
barracks and looking out over the TOW
miles of sea that separates them from
home. The lecturer offered no solution of
the Philippine problem, but his lecture was
a renewed testimonial of the importance
of the question and of the difficulties sur
rounding its solution, and also of th*
bravery and unselfishness of those nov>
bearing the brunt of the burden at the
front. Mr. Brown has a clear delivery
and pleasant voice and his talk is splen

coach the average speed of eight or nine
milea per hour in Great Britain was not
an uncommon occurrence. The roads in
this country did not permit such high
rates of speed as in Great Britain, and
this is one reason why the railroad was
introduced in this country so early and
with such rapidity.
The cost of traveling at the time of the
introduction of the railroad was very
much greater than it was after the train
had been substituted for the stagecoach.
The rates per mile by the slow-going
stage were from 5 to 10 cents, and when
It is considered that the time taken to
make the journey was much greater than
that consumed in covering the same dis
tance at the present time, at rates per
mile barely one-third those formerly paid,
one can realize the relative expense of
travel 100 years ago. In view of these
facts it is not surprising that the amount
of travel at that time was small. English
men have always been great travelers,
but as late as 1S34. according to the esti
mate of Mr. Robert P. Porter, not more
than one-eighth of the people took any
Journeys whatever, and the total number
of miles traveled by those persons did not
exceed 350.000.000 miles annually. These
figures, which are more likely to be ex
cessive than too small, represent hardly
one-Hfth of the traveling dona by English
men at the present time.
Freight Movements 10O Years Ago
and at the Present Time.
The restrictions which the primitive i
means of transportation. of 100 years ago
placed upon freight movement were
greater than those Imposed upon passen- I
â¢per travel. Domestic traffic is so directly
dependent upon facilities for inland water
and land transportation that until the
Considerable Saving Effected Be

for Forage.
The Board of Fire Commissioners met
yesterday, when the bids for the contract
of furnishing two hook and ladder trucks,
two lire engines, 150 hydrants and forage
were opened.
In the awarding of contracts for forage
quite a saving was effected by rejecting
the former bids. The lowest of the for
mer bids for hay was Â»15 59 and the lowest
bid yesterday was $13 OS. a saving of $2 51
f>er ton. D. Keefe was the bidder in both
nstances.
On oats the lowest former bid was $1 54
and the lowest yesterday was $1 49, a sav
ing of 5 cents per 103. D. Keefe was the
lowest bidder in this case also. On straw
the lowest former bid was 73 cents, from
H. P. Smith. Jnd the lowest bid yesterday
was 57 cents, from Peters & Cowle, a sav
ing of 21 cents per bale. On carrots there
Â¦was an increase of 14 cents per 100 tho

and the lowest yesterday 7J cents, D.

improve the natural waterways before
1S23 was done by the several States and
the localities directly interested. The Na

work of improving our natural waterways

Speed and Cost of Travel in 18OO
and 1900.
The limitations which undeveloped
means of transportation placed upon so
ciety may be illustrated by a few refer
ences to the speed and cost of travel by
stage 10) years apo. In England th<Â» ordi
nary coach made fifty miles a day in
summer and thirty in winter. In France
at the same time thirty or forty miles a
day was considered a fair rate of speed
Travel was usually suspended at nljrhtfall
because of the condition of the roads.
There were a few stage lines running
from London to nearby cities that made
bettor time than this. One schedule, that
of the fast coach from Charingr Cross to
Gosport. eiphty miles in nineteen hours is
recorded. The construction of the Mac
adam and Telford roads in England en
abled the stage to increase its speed very

A. Van der Naillen Jr. of 933 Market
street is in receipt ot a letter from A* G.
Wrightson, who was one of the passen
gers for Xome on the steamer Noyo, in
which the writer graphically describes
the cruel torture the unfortunate horses
shipped for the north on the steamer had
to endure owing to inadequate accommo
dation and lack of ordinary care.
The Noyo took north thirty-three head
of flno horses, of which but twenty-two
reached their destination, eleven having
been pitched overboard after they haa
gone through sufferings which Wrightson
aescribes as sickening.
The animals were put in rough wood
stalls and simply tiea by the head, not
the slightest ouort. being made to provide
the customary sling or padding at the
back, front and sides of the stalls. When
the .Noyo, which is a small boat, got out
side where a Heavy sea was running tho
misery of the livestock began. Every roil
or pitch of the ship wouia throw the ter
rified animals violently against one bide
of their stalls and tne reverse motion
pitched them back.
Three days out one mare went mad from
her horrible torture. The flesh on her
chest was ripped completely oft, exposing
her quivering muscles, and she was terri
bly battered and bruised all over. Tne
wretched animal, crazed by her misery,
beat her head from side to side of the stall
until death came and mercifully endea
her suffering.
At this time the horses presented such
a pitiful sight that Van tier Nallien's cor
respondent says it would have been a
merciful thing to have taken a gun and
shot the poor beasts. Another brute that
died after four days of Incessant flinging
about and violent concussion was in an
Indescribably hideous condition. The torn
flesh had e-ancrened. _,'
. The heavy seas- which broke over the
vessel and fell In torrents oh the luckless
brutes, says Mr. "WrJsrhtson, also caused
them great misery. In summing up hi3
account of the horrors of the horse pens
Wrlghtson Rays. "It was a sight wnlch
wouid beggar description."
This state of things was apparently ex
istent on board others of the Nome fleet,
for the letter goes on to say:
"We occasionally passed other floating:
carcasses, which had evidently been cast
overboard from some northbound steamer.
It all seemed to point to the same sad tale
of suffering:."
Mr. Wrightson says that with ordinary
care all this cruelty might have been
averted. Sacks stuffed with straw should
be nailed to the sides, back and front of
each stall to form a soft padding, and, as
is done on army horse transports, each
horse should be steadied by a strap passed
under him.
"These, measures," says Mr. "Wrightson,
"would add to the comfort and health of
the horses and as a consequence to tho
receipts of the owners, while at the same
time such scenes as those which occurred
on the Noyo would be prevented."
Mr. WriKhtson in conclusion" says he de
sires the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals to be informed of the
conditions and also all stockmen who in
tend shipping horses north.

This afternoon the field and staff played

to the lateness of the hour the contest had
to be postponed until the next encamp

miserable for the umpire and the line

of features, chief of which was the sen

pital tent might have had another victim.
Fathers Peter C. Yorke and Philip
O'Ryan went on a fishing expedition yes
terday, and came back with many tro
phies of their skill with the rod and line.
Their only complaint was that the Italian
ilshermen overcharged them for the deni-
I zens of the deep.
! Sergeant Frank Bray. Sergeant Emmet
Gavin and "High" Private Jack Gainey
are known as "The Moochers," because of
their propensity for securing pie without
paving for it-
There iÂ« a new secret organization in
camp. It was organized yesterday and is
known as "The Wildcats." The principal
object of the society is to hold initiations,
and any cadet who crosses their path Is
made a member whether It pleases him or
not. A cadet or "kitten" is proposed for
membership by one of the officers, and a
wild rush is made to secure his consent.
If he shows any Inclination to resist he is
promptly tied up and the officers and
members, who are armed with paddles, are
entitled to two slaps apiece. J. Glacom
mini is called "Chief Rhino" and J. Buck
ley is his assistant. L. Drossel is "Chief
Sawbones" and J. King his assistant. The
"ropemen" are J. Itoth Beag, J. Powers,
J. Catania nnd A. -Osuna. A. Rossi Is
"chief deacon" and Ignatius Henneberry
is "taUholder." The society now number*
goventy members and is likely to reacn
the century mark before long.
Passed a Gold Brick.
Lieutenant Colonel McGloin has a gold
brick on his hands, nnd any one who
â¢wishes to buy it can have it by paying him
50 cents the. yum outlayed for express
charges. The colonel is very wroth and
disgusted that he was taken in so easily.
The brick, wrapped in a nice parcel with
four doughnuts, was brought into camp
by special 'delivery, and before the officer
could judpe its contents he had to pay the
charges. He had many visitors to his tent
to-day, all of whom were eager to see the
gilded trophy.
Company A, which is commanded by Dr.
Hopper, the local society favorite, fecH
that it has not lived up to Its record. Only
one of its aggregation has been In tnÂ»Â«
guardhouse ns yet. but "Fat" Martin
pwears he will initiate a new street
sweeping crowd in the morning. The en
tire company expect? to avoid drill by
taking up quarters in prison.
The. streets were very nicely cleaned
this morning under the direction of Cap
tain Hopper, the officer of the day. That
genial oftlcer had thirty prisoners to do
the. work.
"The Boxers" of Company O held s
ghost dance last night shortly before the
hour when graveyards yawn. Privat*
O'Connor, the leader of the dance, was
captured by the puard and thrown into
the guardhouse. The other members of
the danceâ Corporal Rcilly, Sergeant
O'Day and Private Boeâ retreated into
Private Glnnan's tent a'nd disturbed his
pleasant dreams of home and mother by ,
stepping on his appetite.
Joe O'Brien, Frank Holland and Shell I
McAuliiTe of Company E are threatened
with dire calamities if they do not make
less noise in the "wee sma' hours." Bill
Ganey complains that they disturb his
rest.
Bouquets for Thompson.
Sergeant "Brick" Thompson believes he
Is the victim of a scurvy trick, and he
blames "Fat'VMartln and Musician Ed
Moore for perpetrating it. Thompson was
awakened from his sleep last night by a
bull pup. a head of cabbage and a bom
bardment of green apples. The pup was
tied to the tent and proceeded to pull the
canvas covering down In its efforts to get
loose. A head of cabbage was thrown on
"Brick." and as he came to his tent flap
to anathematize the disturbers of his slum
bers he was greeted with a shower of fruit
and had to b/>at a hasty retreat. His loud
cries for vengeance were heard by "Fat"
Martin, who was on^uard in the vicinity,
and the latter, who was in on the joke,
called out the guard and threw the inno
cent sergeant into the guardhouse. Brick
swears to get even with his tormentors.
He blames Captain Hopper. Musician
Moor*, Achilla Artigues Connolly. Leavitt
Sergeant Gauran is leader of the "Heln
agapoopler band." The band practiced In
camp to-day and made life miserable for
all those within hearing distance. Gauran
wielded the baton like a professional.
Father Kennedy played the cornet. GJa

EUREKA IN HEAVY WEATHER OET HTJMBOLDT BAR.
The new steamer Eureka had a hard run
of it from Humboldt Bay. A northwester
made things uncomfortable after the bar
was crossed, and then as soon as that was
run out of a southeaster came up. There
were 160 head of cattle in the hold, and
as - everything had to be battened down
these suffered terribly. An attempt was
made to open the ports so as to create a
draft, but the ship was rolling so heavily
that every minute the lower deck was
flooded and the openings had to be closed
again.
Soon Captain Jessen discovered that tho
cattle were suffocating. He made a wind
sail out of the jib and put it down the
forward hatch and everything possible for
the relief of the oxen was done. It was
of little use", however, and nearly 100 head
of the animals died before smooth water
was reached. The whole consignment was
taken to the sugar refinery and landed
there.
The steamers Orizaba and Humboldt
had similar experiences some months ago.
Both of them were caught in heavy
weather after leaving Humboldt Bay, and
in the case of the Orizaba nearly every
animal aboard perished. On the Eureka
such an accident' will not happen again,
as before sho sailed again last night for
Eureka her hold was titted with electric
fans, which will be kept constantly at
work while there are cattle aboard.
Tellus Is Badly Damaged.
Tho collier Tellus, which was in colli
sion with the transport Belgian. King, was
docked at the Dunsmuir xoal bunkers yes
terday and the work of unloading her was
begun at once. Every ounce of coal will
be first taken out of the forward hatch
so as to enable the inspectors to get a
good view of' the hole in her bow. A
rough estimate by an expert places the
damage to the Tellus at $30,000, while $10,
000 will have 1 to be spent on the Belgian.
King in repairs. The latter vessel is still
in the bay with four holes in her bow,
punched there when she crashed into the
Tellus. Neither captain will talk about
the accident, but to-day the captain of the
Belgian King will make a report to the
British Consul, while the captain of the
Tellus will make his to the Norwegian
Consul.
G. B. Hunter and the Wallsend Slipway
Company filed a libel in the United States
District Court yesterday, against the Tel
lus, claiming reasonable salvage. The
complaint states that on July 17 near Point
Reyes the Belgian King and the Tellua
collided, the collision tearing a hole in tho
bow of the Tellus. and that the Belgian
King stood by and towed the Tellus to
port. >
Rio de Janeiro Sails.
The Mall Company's steamer Rio de
Janeiro sailed for the Orient yesterday.
She had a full list in the cabin and many
Chinese in the steerage. Among the latter
was Kim Kuey, the Mongolian maiden
who ligured in the Mayfleld abduction
case. She was deported by order of the
United States courts.
Among those who went away In the
cabin were Martin J. Egan of the Chron
icle and L. Douglas Adam of The Call.
Mr. Kgan is going to China to report the
war news for a syndicate, while Mr.
Adam has given up the newspaper busi
ness and will make his home in Kobe,
Japan, henceforth. Captain Farenholt, U.
S. N.. Is also a passenger, and goes to
Hongkong to rejoin, his command.
Dismasted in a Squall.
The schooner Corinthian was towed into
port yesterday by the steamer Xavarro
and beached on the Mission mudflats. She
was caught in the squall that tore the
masts out of the German bark J. C.
Pfluger.
The Corinthian was bound up the coast
for a load of firewood, and on July 8, at
3 a. m.. was twenty-five miles west of the
Faralloms. A northwest squall struck her
and in a moment the fore and main masts
were over the side. The squall passed as
quickly as it came up and then a jurv rig
was fixed up from the broken spars. " Un
der this the schooner reached Santa Cruz
and from there was towed to San Fran
cisco by the Xavarro.
Water Front Notes.
The scow Edna, that became water
logged and was deserted by her crew on
Wednesday night, drifted out as far as
the heads and then drifted in again. She
was picked up by the launch Crowley and
towed to tho Vallejo-street wharf. She
will be discharged and repaired.
The bark C. D. Bryant arrived in port
yesterday, after a long passage of thirty
eight days from Honolulu. Lisrht winds
and calms delayed the vessel. Besides she
is very foul from not having been dry
docked for a long time, and that helped
to keep her back.
Germany has purchased a lot of coal in
British Columbia and is now seeking for
transports to carry the black diamonds
to Chinn. Uncle Sam has an option on all
the available vessels, however, and therÂ«
will be some trouble in getting the coal
to the German warships.

phases of the subject will be considered.
In no other field of activity is the prog
ress of the nineteenth century better typi
fied than in the improvements which have
taken place In the means of transporta
tion. One hundred years ago travel and
traffic were nearly all confined to the road
and the unimproved natural waterway.
Moreover, the highway was still unim
proved. Although the first turnpike com.
Pany in the United States was chartered
in li90, and between 1792 and 1794 construct
ed a turnpike between Philadelphia and
Lancaster, the buildinp of these improved
roads in the United States was hardly be

nearly twenty years old. In Grew Britain

TRANSPORTATION ADVANCE IN 100 YEARS,
SEATTLE, July 19.â Two vessels arrived
in port from Nome to-dayâ the transport
Athenian and the steamship Sequoia, The
Sequoia arrived early in the morning ana
the Athenian about 11 o'clock.
The Sequoia left Nome late on the night
of the 3d and brings much late news about
the smallpox epidemic which the Garonne
and Ohio, both leaving early on the same
day. overlooked.
The pesthouse at Nome Is full and over
flowing with patients afflicted with small,
pox, and the Government officials are
erecting two other larger structures, one
of which, with adjuncts, will cover an
acre of ground.
The disease has spread rapidly and lots
of case." are quarantined in the tents in
which they were discovered. Every Gov
ernment and city offlotal and doctor In
the camp Is working: night and day with
the disease, but It seems useless to try to
Ftop it.
Dr. J. J. Tyler, from Chlcapo. who went
north on the first boats to follow his pro.
fission in the new camp, returned on the
Sequoia, and fays there are at least 200
cases in the posthou?e nnd around the
camp, at a conservative estimate, and the
people are being taken down at the rate
of seventeen to twenty a day.

WHEATâ The threatening news from China
has thus far had no effect on the European
markets, which are dull and weak. Paris and
Liverpool were both lower again yesterday.
Chicago opened weak on lower cables, but re
covered and closed strong at an advance. There
were more buyers than sellers and the foreign

crop reports were worse. The b-jlls talked
higher, but were too timid to back their Judg

CHICAGO. July 19.â Wheat opened weak un
der a combination of lower foreign markets
n"nd the reiteration by the Price Current of Its
optimistic conclusions as to the season's wheat
production. 1'aris and Liverpool were both
weak, while the Price Current averred that the
surplus this year would exceed the exports of
last year. September opened %*giÂ£c to %(ff*ic
lower at 7">Q"70V4c. Thereafter the market
phowed strength, which gradually increased as
the session progressed. In this the main factor
was to be found in numerous reports denying
recent assertions that the Northwest crop had
been vastly Improved .by rains. These poner
ally put the yield of the Dakotas and Minne
sota at 100,GC<\COO bushels. New York bought;
there was a fair commission house demand and
purchasing by scalpers. Shorts covered when
they saw the way things were going, and as a
result September steadily rose and closed at
the top, %<)lc over yesterday, at Ti%c.
Corn suffered from early depression and
fliKhtlnees. The market opened weak under the
Influence of Liverpool and discouraging cables.
Receipts were small and some. Western Influ
ences sold. Cash people showed confidence In
their position by demanding 41c, or even frac
tionally more, for corn in store, and the busi
ness done amounted to half a million bushels
ca?h. September closed %c over yesterday at
SS^ftSSc. *
The oats market followed corn as usual. The
trading was dull. September closed unchanged
from yesterday at 23Hc.
The trade In provisions was narrow, but the
tone was steady on a fair though scattered de
mand for cash. September pork closed 5c low
er, lard 2%Â©5c lower and ribs 5c down.

There was unusual flatness In the markets
here to-day, caused by the advance of the
bank rate to 4 rer cent and the spread of the
Chinese rebellion. There was little actual
business, but pawned stock came out. The war
loan dipped to 2'4 discount and then rallied
to 1% on large purchases by the American
Insurance companies, which failed to secure
allowable allotments In the first Instance.

Over the Bodies of Howe and

Special Pispatrh to The Call.
CLIFTON. Ariz., July 19.â The Coroner's
Jury, which returned to-day from Eagle
Creek, where an Inquest was held over
the remains of "W. F. Howe and Joe
Wheeler, is convinced that the murder in
the small canyon was committed by Cho
can and his notorious following of Mex
ican bandits, which has Infested the Bo
nita Mountains for years. The murder of
three Chinamen in Chase Creek two
months apo Is traced to the same gang,
two members of which have Just been
captured and are In Jail to answer for
the crime. Word was received from Met
calf this morning of the murder of an
other Chinaman near that place.
Howe and Wheeler came to Morencl re
cently and were employes of the Detroit
copper plant. Howe came from Okla
homa and Wheeler from Oregon, accom
panied by his family. Chocan was seen
In Guthrle the other day and came toward
his stamping grounds In the Bonita Moun
tains, where Howe and Wheeler were am
bushed and slain a day or two later.
The Mexican element In Clifton and Mo
rencl Is aiding the movements of the out
laws and is said to be financially Inter
ested in their depredations. Although
killings have occurred in this vicinity
wth such startling- frequency as to arouse
officers and citizens there Is little assur
ance of the early capture of the Mexican
outlaws. ___Â£:'

saying:
"When I left California the indictment
of Assessor Dalton was the subject of
universal discussion and was, of course,
denounced by all thinking men hs a po
litical indecency and an attempt to kill off
the Assessor as a candidate for Congress.
Knowing Henry Dalton as well as I do,
I knew that his defense would be a manly
and straightforward one, devoid of tech
nicality, and his prompt vindication by
the court on the merits of the case bore
out my estimate of the man and put the
stamp of judicial disapproval upon the
Grand Jury's attempt to besmirch the rep
utation of an honest and an upright and
conscientious public official. Before I
went away I had no doubt that the people
of Alameda County would not permit such
an act to have the effect Its instigators
hoped it would have. That is my opinion
now, and I think that I am not mistaken
In my estimate of the temper of the peo

Richard L. Crump, Who Was Be
lieved by Relatives to Be Dead,
Is in San Francisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW LONDON, Conn., July 19.â A letter
was received here yesterday bearing a San
Francisco postmark and addressed to Mrs.
Mary C. Crump. Mrs. Crump's daughter
recognized in the address the handwriting
of her brother, Richard L. Crump, who had
been given up as dead. Miss Crump lost
no time in forwarding the letter to her
mother, who is at the seashore, and the
daughter's belief proved correct.
The young lawyer wrote that he was in
San Francisco and in good health, but did
not say a word of his whereabouts or do
ings since he disappeared from New York
several months ago.
Young Crump, who was a student at
Albany. N. V., left that city for his home
here on October 14, 1*!>9, to spend a few
days' vacation. Nothing was known of
his proposed visit until the landlady with
whom Crump boarded wrote a postal
card inquiring when he was going to re
turn to Albany. This started the family
on a search for Richard, and it was dis
covered that he had called for his baggage
at the Grand Central Station two days
after his arrival In New York, but no
trace of him could be found. It was feared
the young man had met with foul play,
as he had several hundred dollars on his
person, and the police and detectives made
a. thorough search of New York without
success.
Pictures of Mr. Crump were published in
many papers and photographs were sent
to every lodgo of Klks. Crump being a
prominent member of the order.
Relatives believe the young man was
suffering from temporary aberration as a
result of hard study at Albany. He was
a graduate of Williams College and had a
law offlce here until he enlisted in Com
pany I, Third Regiment of Connecticut
Volunteers, during the Spanish-American
war.

Thle Is the first time I have ever heard
General Gordon, and I want to say our nation
owes him more than any other for the voice
he has raised for our union, and nothing but
our union. In my recent visits throughout the
South my heart has been stirred by the evi
dence that we are to live hereafter in the

BERGEROW'S SECOND
VICTIM PASSES AWAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. July 19.â August Berger, the'
second victim of last Sunday's shooting
by Constable Bergerow, died this morn
ing at 8:30 o'clock. But little hopes had
been entertained for his recovery, and he
had been conscious but a few short times
since the shooting. Bergerow. who in a
drunken frenzy committed the crime
must now answer. to the double crime of
murder. When informed of Berber's death
to-day he seemed to.be affected and hune
his head, but said nothing.
Berger was a native of Germany and 36
years old. He had been employed at the
Frederlcksburg brewery for thirteen
years.. A widow and two children are left
to mourn his death.
The funeral of Joseph Cech, the other
victim of Bergerow. was held yesterday
and was largely attended. Berger will
probably be buried Sunday.
An inquest into the death of Berger was
held this afternoon by Coroner Kefi. Tea- j
timony taken wns the same as in the case
of Cech. The jury, after deliberating a
few moments, returned a verdict that
Berger met Â¦ his death from a gunshot
wound inflicted by Bergerow.
The Brewers' Union, of which deceased
was a" member. Is taking active steps to
Bee that Bergerow gets his full deserts,
and has engaged Attorneys E. ECothran
and W.:L. Gill to assist in the'prosecu

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. July tX
Joseph Bayless, a resident of this city,
was burned to death last night on hi.^
ranch at Glencoe. Calaveras County. Word
of the terrible death of the old man cann
to Oakland this morning, just aa his fam
ily was preparing to leave for G'encoe ti>
join him.
Mr. Baylesa had just completed a very
handsome home on a SX)-acre ranch which
he owned in that neighborhood. Tlv
house was the most hand.-'>me for mile;*
around, and he had sent for his family
In Oakland to take up their residence in
their new home. How the now housu
caught fire is uncertain, but word cornea
that Mr. Bayless was awakened and mailu
his escape with some of his more valuable
articles. He then made an attempt to
enter the burning building and recover
some more articles ami was caught when
the roof fell In and burned to death.
Mr. Bayless was 3n years of age and
leaves a wife and four children â threw
boys and Miss Jonie Bay'.ess. who lives at
the corner of Market and Lydia streets.
Joseph Baylesa was originally a house
mover, and in that business had accumu
lated a competency. But one day ho
picked up a tortune. the exact amount of
which has never been known.
Bayless was the housemover who while
moving a house. from the corner of Tent:
and Grove streets eight years ago un
earthed a fortune in crohl Ingots that wero
supposed to have been taken fmm the
I'nited States Mint twenty years ago by
a defaulting coiner. The affair was sur
rounded In much mystery, and Bayless
never would admit how much he founÂ«l
or whether he found anything. It is .*aM
that he secured JST.not). a portion of which
he gave to Bert Flora, lie certainly se
cured a !arge amount, a portion of which
went for the purchase of the Calaverai
ranch where he met hi* death. Thi* ranch
is said to have several gold-bearing ledeej
that have prospects of proving very valu
able.

PANAMA. July 19.â The Pacific Mail
steamship Costa Rioa this morning came
successfully alongside the new Panama
Ilailroad wharf at La Boca, near the en
trance to the canal. She came in loaded
through the canal channel and drew fif
teen feet of water. The depth of wati-r
at the wharf was forty feet. This is the
first time a larj<e vessel has come to the
wharf. Other ships of greater tonnage
will probably follow.
The new system will completely revo
lutionize the handling of freight, which,
since the opening of the Panama Railroad,
has been done by means of lighters and
steam tugs down the bay.

PHOENIX. Ariz.. July 19.â The greatest
drought in the history of Arizona was
broken to-day by light showers in the up
per part of the Salt River Valley, and to
night heavy storms are gathering. The
drought has been exceedingly damaging to
stock and business -of all kinds, but It is
likely to prove a blessing in hastening the
construction of a great reservoir for irri
gation water. The cost of the proposed
leservolr will approximate $2,500,000. It
will hold sufficient water to reclaim over
250,000 additional acres of desert land.

{Demurrer to the Complaint
Â¦ Overruled by Judge
Fritz
Court Holds Company Is Practically
in the Same Position as Cigar
Dealers or Saloon
Keepers.
Â»
Judgment was rendered yesterday by
Judge Fritz on the demurrers In the casea
of John I. Sabin. president, and Fred W.
Eaton, secretary, of the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph Company, charged by Tax
Collector Scott with violating ordinances
of the Board of Supervisors by refusing
to give the number of telephones In use
and to pay a license on each machine with
a slot attachment.
I": tee points were raised, the first one
being that ordinance 1389 did not apply to
telephones and it was proper for the court
to consider the proceedings of the Board
of Supervisors at the time the ordinance
went into effect. The Judge decided that
he could not go outside the ordinance it
self to determine the intention of the leg
islators.
The second point raised was that ordi
nance lb*'J was repealed by hill 26, ordi
nance ST>, of the Board of Supervisors,
whici) provides that tor each telephone
instrument a quarterly license of i>j cents
must be paid. The Judge held that a
nlckel-in-tne-slot attachment was not
necessarily a part of a telephone instru
ment and that there might be a tax im
posed on an instrument and also on any
attachment that might be placer! on it.
The third point raised was that the tele
phone company had a license to transact
telephone business and that It could not
transact the business without the use of
a nickel-in-lhe-slot attachment. The
Judge held that the attachment was not
necessarily a part of the telephone busi
ness; that it was of great assistance to the
company in the collection of money, but ii
was clearly possible that the companv
could carry on the business without the
attachments. The Judge cited the Instance
of a cigar dealer or a saloon-keeper. Each
paid a license to conduct his business,
but they were also taxed and paid a
license upon each nickel-in-the-slot ma
chine In their places. It was no more
necessary for the telephone company to
have nickel-in-the-slot attachments than
it was necessary for the cigar dealer or
saloon-keeper.
The demurrer was accordingly overruled
and the casrs were continued till August
27 to enable the prosecution to present its
evidence so that the matter might be put
into a shape that would enable the de
fendants to appeal to the higher court.

The application of J. F. Foulds for an
order dismissing the citation for contempt
against H. E. Huntington, J. C. Stubbs
and T. 11. Goodman, principal officers of
the Southern Pacific Company, was denied
yesterday by Judge Bahrs. The contempt
proceedings grew out of the refusal of the
Southern Pacific Company to restore the
rate of $3 75 from San Francisco to Fresno,
ordered by the court in its decree of
July 10.
Attorney Foulds based his application
on a recent decision of the Supreme Court,
which holds that all mandatory injunc
tions are stayed by appeal. Foulds con
tended that Judge Hahrs" order was of a
mandatory character and therefore bound
by the ruling of the Supreme Court.
Foulds held that while the company is
perfecting its appeal from this mandatory
order there coirni he no contempt.
Attorn^v General Kord argued that an
appeal tud not suspend Judgment In any
case. He said the injunction under dis
cussion was prohibitory and in no sense
mandatory. If this weie true the defend
ant corporation was required to obey it
in every particular, even though an appeal
were taken to a higher court within the
statutory period of time. The Attorney
Oeneral continued: /
"We are dealing here not with any com
mand of the Railway Commissioners but
with a decree of this court. This injunc
tion orders the defendant company to per
form a certain act, and whether an appeal
is pending or not, the injunction must bo
obeyed. This motion should be denied,
and if this matter is appealed we will
meet the issue in the Supreme Court."
Judge Bahrs made no comment upon the
argument, but immediately made a for
mal order dismissing the motion to quash
the citation directing Huntington, Stubbs
and Goodman to show cause. Foulds de
sired to secure a postponement of the cita
tion for contempt until July 30 in order
that Attorney Garber. who is out of the
city, might be communicated with rela
tive to defending the railway corporation
in the suit. Attorney General Ford would
not consent to so great a delay, but inti
mated that he would on next Monday
agree to a short continuance If a suffi
cient cause for postponement be shown.
The matter then went over until 10 a. m.
on Monday, when a date for argument
will bi? finally selected. The three rail
road officials named have been ordered to
appear at that time.

Acting: Mayor Tobin Checks Scheme
by Directing Captain Spillane
to See That Grab Is Not
Accomplished.
Ki ting Mayor Tobin called the attention
I Captain BpOIane of the Southern Police
â¢Istrict yesterday to the fact that the
Market-street Railway Company was
l>r. paring to erect electric poles along
r'irst street from Market to Folayn
streets. The Mayor directed Captain
BpUlane to prevent the company from
jutting up the ji^.les ap it had never been
granted the privilege by the Board of
Supervisors. Captain Spillane detailed
two police officers to put a stop to the con-
T i-rrjilated trespass and made a personal
Investigation on his own account. He
found that the iron poles were stretched
iit Intervals along the gutterways prepar
atory to tx-i:nj put In position probably
uurins the night.
There were no workmen in the vicinity
during: the day and it is likely that the
sipht of two policemen specially detailed
Bnd the three regular officers on Mission.
Howard and Folsom streets prevented
â¢ay Intended move on the part of the
graspinp Mrcoi railroad corporation. Up
to a late hour last night the contemplated
action had not been consummated.
Acting Mayor Tobin whs indignant .it
what ho nrmod an unwarranted proceed
ing on the part of the Market -street Com
pany. He said that the corporation must
certainly obtain permission from the
Board of Supervisors by ordinance before
it wouM )... allowed to erect poles or
string wires.
The company holds a franchise for a
horse car line <>n First streot. but this
doe? not carry wiih it the privilege of
iunnh;ji r!*ctric cars on this street. In
order t<> hold* the franchise the corpora
tion has run ,t solitary one-horse car
mornings from fi:30 to 7:30 and evenings
frnni Â«:3'i to 7:?A The company is repeat
ing its high handed proceedings in recent
ly stripping wires on Bush street from
Ream? to Pan?orn<Â» and along Sansome
street, thouerh in this case the wires were
strung from thf buildines after permis
sion was first obtained from the property
owners. The Hoard of Supervisors has
ruled that permission must first be re
ceived to string wires. Captain BpUlane
F!Â»ys that he will keep two men specially
iletailed to see that the company does not
violate the law in erecting poles without
having been granted the privilege by the
city.

The midweek reserve stake at Union
Coursing Park was won - yesterday by
Harlean Gladys, a youngster by St. Law
rence-Moonli&ht, and entered by T. Jones.
The winner Is a Futurity candidate and
If her exhibition of speed In yesterday's
stake is any criterion there ls.no doubt
that she will make a good showing in that
event In the deciding course with Best
Bargain Gladys assumed a lead right from
the slips and held a good five lengths to
the turn. She piled up six points and
then turned the hare to Best Bargain,
who made the kill, scoring his only points.
Throughout the stake Gladys allowed
only three points to be recorded against
her, she having got the flag from Modesty,
Rather Artful, Baby King. Twilight Jr.
and Erin's Hope in that order, with clean
scores except with Twilight Jr., who mafia
a single point.
St. Ives and his sister, Annie Lawrence,
showed In good form, as did another
youngster. Coronado. The latter dog up
set tne talent In his go with St. Ives in
the third round. Four to one was quoted
against the winner's chances. Whisky
Hill, another favorite, went wrong for the
plungers. Through favor of the hare ne
lost In a close score to Rather Artful, a
1 to 3 choice. The other short-ends which
won . were Game Cock, who beat Cora

HARLEAN GLADYS
WINS THE STAKE
BY CLEVER WORK
PARIS, July 19.â The manner in which
the American athletes had been sweeping
the fields in the international games in
connection with the Paris exposition
opened the eyes of the. organizers, and
the result was shown, in the handicapping
to-day, which practically left the Ameri
cans out in the cold. * The effect upon the
Americans was demonstrated by the fact
that whereas on the previous days they
had secured four-flfths of the games, to
day out of the nine events they captured
only one first, with four seconds. and five
thirds.
The feature of the day's programme was
the twenty-five mile Marathon footrace.
The first and second prizes, valued at 500
and 250 francs respectively, were the gifts
of an American shver manufacturing com.
pany, the first being a large silver loving
cup and the second one somewhat smaller,
the company having given prizes In ths.
standing high and broad jumps.
The race, a trying one under any condi
tions, threw an exceptional strain upon
the contestants to-day owing to a blazing
sun that poured upon their heads
throughout the run, and of the thirteen
who entered only seven were able to
linish. The result was a victory for a
Frenchman, and his compatriots celebrat
ed their first and only win in the sports
with characteristic enthusiasm. French
spectators invaded the track and carried
Theatro Michel around on their shoul
ders, while the cheers resoundeii across
the grounds.
Americans Fare Badly.
The three Amjbrlcan competitors, to
whom the course was quite new and
proved a severe handicap, fared badly.
Newton made the best showing, keeping
pace with the leading batch of French
men until about twenty miles had been
covered. By this time all the weaklings
had been weeded out. Newton, who had
not been feeling well for several days,
overcome by the heat and exertion, was
now obliged to drop behind. He struggled
on pluckily to the end, but reached the
goal nearly an hour and a quarter after
the winner. By this time the spectators
imagined that all save those who had ar
rived had abandoned the race and many
went home. Newton's arrival, therefore,
passed almost unnoticed, except by the
Americans, who gave him an encourag
ing cheer as he entered the track for the
three laps which formed the conclusion
of the race. This ho did walking. Grant
and McDonald arrived a little later to
gether. Grant, who was quite done up,
dropped on the grass after passing the
finish line, and seemed to be in a fainting
condition. He received every attention
from the French and other people, who
stood over him fanning him. Finally he
recovered and wulked to the dressing
room leaning on the arm of his trainer.
Missed the Pole Vault.
Owing either to a lack of notice or to
unfamiiiarity with the language, the
Americans were barred from the contest
for the pole vault. The men were all in
costume and sitting beneath a tree about
twenty yards from the point of contest,
but the French officials called names un
known to them, and when they saw the
pole vaulting start they walked over and
attempted to compete, but were not per
mitted to take part. As the result of their
being left out, they were allowed a spe
cial scratch event. > .â¢
What would have happened had they
been allowed to enter the regular compe
tition can be gathered from comparison
of the results with those in the regular
event. In the former Kauser, a Hungar
ian, won with three metres 95 centimetres;
Lemmaing, a Swede, tvbs second, with 3
metres 40 centimetres, and Colett was
third with 3 metres 20 centimetres. Kau
ser's handicap of 45 centimetres gave him
the prize.
On the other hand,) in the scratch event
Horton cleared 3 metres 45 centimetres
and Dvorack 3 metres and 40 centimetres.
Fifteen Heats Required.
The'' day's programme opened with the
handicap 100 metres fiat race, for which
there were sixty-five entries, necessitat
ing fifteen trial heats.
'The semi-finals were won by Minnehan
McClain, Holland, Schubert and Pritchard
and Â»hese contested in the final, which
was a pretty race and full of interest.
Mlnnehan's handicap was six metres. Jlc-
Claln's three and one-half. Schubert's
one-half, Holland's four and Pritchard's
three. All got off well, but as they swept
over the turf the blue and gray of George
town's two entries were seen to be leading
safely. They finished almost abreast,
Minnehan beating Â¦ his college mate.
Pritchard was third. Time, 10 4-5 seconds.
Thirty-four men entered the 800 metres
fiat race, which was contested in four
trial heats. Hayes, with a handicap of
45 metres, won the first; Lord, of Chicago
University, with a handicap of 35 metres,
was second; Cregan, with a handicap of
five metres, won the second heat; Bennet,
with a handicap of 15 metres, getting
second place. The third heat went to
Christensen, Dane, with a handicap of
15 centimetres, Mechlin*, with a handicap
of 25 metres, being second. The last heat
was captured by Hall, Brown University;
Ave, French, being serond.
Handicap Too Big.
When it came to the final a big handi
cap of 75 metres was given to Chriptensen.
which was impossible to overcome, and
he finished yards ahead, Hayes being
second and Lord third. Time, 1:52.
Second men contested the 400 metres
hurdle race, Tewksbury and Lewis of the
Americans starting, but Kraonzlein, who
was the scratch man, not starting. Im
mediately after the start it was seen that
the finish would be betjveen. the two
Americans and Pritchard of the English
team. Pritchard had the best handicap
and his load was not overcome. He won
rather handily in one minue six seconds.
Te*w-ksbury bring second and Lewis third.
PritcharcTs handicap was 15 metres,
Tewksbury's 4& and Lewis' 10. Fabre,
CharlPP, De Roa and Tnuzln. all French
men, were the other starters. Although
twenty-two men entered in the 2500 metres
steeplechase only twelve started, as the
handicaps frightened many.
The Americans and Englishmen felt
that they had no chance of winning, and
it was only at the last minute that Orton
decided to start. The two men with the
biggest handicaps were Duhnoe (German)
with 240 metres, and Kraschtll (Austrian)
with 230. These two led all the -way and
finished with the Austrian in front.
Bu&hnell of the University- of Pennsyl
vania with 175 metres handicap, was
third. Time. 7 minutes 17 2-5 seconds.
Grant was the other American in the race,
and he and Orton were too heavily handi
capped to hone to win. .
In the running high' jump handicap
Torebloem (Swede), with a handicap of
65 centimetres, was first, clearing two
metres five 'centimetres; Strauss, a Hun
garian, with 35 centimetres handicap, was
second, clearing two metres, and Reming
ton of the University of Pennsylvania
with a handicap of 20 centimetres; Goen
ezy, a Hungarian, with 25 centimetres
handicap, and Steffen. a German, with
SO centimetres handicap, tied -for third
place with 1 metre 95 centimetres.
Swede Wins. Discus Throw.
The Americans did not make a show in
the discus throw, which was won by 8o
derscom, a Swede.
In' the long jump handicap thÂ« Ameri
cans stood a better chance" and secured a
secoml and thrrd priie. the result being
that Koppan, a Hungarian with a handi
cap of 1 metre 60 centimetres, jumped 7
metres S9',2 centimetres; McClain, 1 Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, with a handicap of
S5 centimetres, did- 7 metres 72 centime
tres; Remington, with a handicap of 20
centimetres, covered 7 metres 65 centime
tres; and Prinsteln, the .scratch man,
broke "the French record with .7 metres
25*4 centimetres. .â ..
? It is. noteworthy that PrinsteinV Jump
to-day was >even Inches better Â¦ than
Kraenzleln's Sunday jump, which won the
championship, â¢when Prinstein stood out
owinp to niisuno'prstanrlinjr. $$yS$3&BMB|

CLARK EXPECTS TO BE
RETURNED TO THE SENATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
i LOS ANGELES^July 19.â Former United
States Senator W.' A. Clark of Montana,
who has been visiting his aged mother In
this city and inspecting his sugar factory
at Alamltos, in company with his brother.
J. Ross Clark, has returned to New York
Instead of going to his home in Butte City.
Ho will not pass his vacation in this coun
try, but will sail for Europe on July 28.
This determination to absent himself is
tantamount to a belief that no extra ses
sion is now anticipated. . .
"I am. absolutely certain of a triumph in
Montana at the ensuing election," Mr.
Clark said, "and I expect to present my
self at Washington next March with cre
dentials as a United States Senator that
will be respected. -This means, that Mon
tana will be Democratic."
Mr. Clark said he was at a loss to ac
count for the rumor that he would gjve
$1,000,000 toward Bryan's campaign. His
personal contribution to the Democratic
campaign committee will be In the neigh
borhood of $50,000.
Nothing has happened to lessen the bit
ter enmity that exists between Marcus
Daly and Senator Clark.- The fact of
Clark reducing the hours and raising the
pay of the men in his mines will, it is
asserted by his friends, prove a heavy
; blow to the Anaconda king. The differ
ence in money, If Daly follows his pace,
represents a big percentage of his income.
This Clark can stand, as he need not share
the profits, with stockholders In his mines
and has more copper ore in sight than he
can smelt if he lives to be a centenarian.
Thomas J. Conroy was appointed Pacific
Coast manager of the insurance depart
ment of Balfour. Guthrie & Co. yesterday.
There are four companies included in the
departmentâ the Manchester, Caledonia,
American of New Jersey and American
of New York. Mr. Conroy has been act
ing as the assistant manager for some
time, L. B. Edwards, the former man
ager, having retired. George Brooks, who
has been the city agent of the four com
panies, was made assistant manager. The
changes, which amounted to a reorgani
zation of the department, were directed
by G. S. P.. Young of New York, who had
author'.ty from the four companies named
to act as he saw fit. The new order or
things took effect at once. All the parties
concerned say that there was no motive
but business considerations.
Thomas J. Conroy, the new manager, has
been connected with the insurance busi
ness in San Fuanclsco over two score
vears. His first position was with the
Manhattan, in 1879. After a time he made
a connection with the Fireman's Fund
Insurance Company. Then for twelve
years he was assistant manager of the
Board of Fire Underwriters of the Pacific
Next he was special agent of the Hart
ford, traveling for three years In the
States of the Northwest. He was appoint
ed assistant manager of the Insurance de
partment of Balfour, Guthrie & Co. in
January, 1Â§98, and joint manager last
March. His rise has been rapid. George
Brooks, the new assistant manager, was
formerly city agent for the London and
Lancashire. He has been with the Bal
four-Guthrle agency only a comparatively
short time.
The changes occasioned a buzz among
the Insurance men yesterday when news
of the appointments and also of the retire
ment of Mr. Edwards was made known.
During the past' two years the insurance
Interests of the coast have been carefully
studied by Eastern officials. At one time
the respective presidents of all four com
panies in Balfour. Guthrie & Co.'s Insur
ance department were here to look things
over. Mr. Edwards will retain connection
with the same companies, acting in an
other capacity.

HEW INSURANCE
MANAGER NAMED
FOR THE COAST
A RUFFIANLY attempt waa made
at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon
to seize and capture the official
roll of the Forty-fourth District
Republican Club. In the struggle
for possession of the document the roll
was torn In two pieces. L. A- Rea, execu
tive committeeman of the Republican
County Committee and president of the
Forty-fourth District official club, gives
this account of the. raid:
"I was In my office at 1318-1320 3tockton
street conferring with several gentlemen
from Fresno In regard to the establish
ment of an oil company, when my clerk
called me out, saying some one wanted to
see me. Â» _ .
"I went to the door and saw that MarÂ«
tin McUowan. Morris Bushway and James
J. Cunningham were there. McGowan
said he believed that the roll was stuffed.
I called him into tha rear room and pro
duced the roll to show him that the en
rollment was fair and regular throughout.
Suddenly he put both hands against my
breast, pushed me over and Instantly
seized the roll. He passed the roll quickly
to Bushway, who Instantly handed It to
Cunningham. At once Cunningham start
ed to run at full speed down tne street.
"The purpose of the visit dawned on mÂ©
at once. 1 recovered my balance, threw
McOowan aside and gave chase to Cun
ningham. I overhauled him in front of a
furniture store and landed him in the
midst of a pile of furniture. Before
seizing the roll to retake it 1 demanded
Its return, but Cunningham would not re
linquish his hold. There was then a gen
eral mix-up. I wrested the roll from his
grasp. Meanwhile McGowan and Bush
way came to his assistance and a large
throng of people from neighboring stores
and houses came out to help me. I got
the roll and gave the ruffians my opinion
of their conduct and the acts of the bosses
who sent them to do the work."
In reporting the affair to the County
Committee last night the president of the
club did not hesitate to express the opinion
that the rounders who sought to seize the
roll got their instructions trom Kelly and
Crimmins. The roll- contains the names
of 600 voters, hence the bosses of the Mint
saloon are anxious to get possession of it.
When political bosses of the Kclly-Crim
mins ilk see defeat staring them in the
face they do not scruple at smashing a
ballot box or stealing a club roll.
The Forty-third District Republican
Club held a large and enthusiastic meet
ing last evening at California Hall. 620
Bush street. J. D. Hart presided and
Fred Tobelmann acted as secretary. The
meeting was a representative one and
harmonious throughout. Many old resi
dents and property owners were present
and took a keen interest In the proceed
ings. Speeches were made by T. IC Kase.
S. H. Scott. Dawson Mayer, J. George
Boyne, F. P. Shibeley, W. C. R. Smith.
Dr. T. H. Morris and others. The follow
ing delegates were chosen to represent the
club In the three conventions:
State Conventionâ Captain Robert Wleneke.
W. C. R. Smith. W. E. Bridge. A. O. Plan.
James Klopenstein. Carl Jacobsen. John P.
Fraser.
Congressional Conventionâ John Leinhardt.

liams. Antonla Podesto, J. H. Harney. James
D. Hart. . .
The club adjourned to the call of the
chair, with cheers for McKinley and
Roosevelt and Congressman Julius Kahn
and the anti-boss ticket. This Is the regu
lar club, organized a year ago as the
Grand Hotel anti-boss, antl-Crimmlns and
Kelly organization.
The Bear Republican Club held its reg
ular weekly, meeting last night at 121
Eddy street. Congressman Julius Kahn
addressed the meeting and scored the
Tammany leaders of New York for their
connection with the great ice trust. The
club Is taking a deep interest In the drill
corps. Two companies under the direc
tion of George Meihling and C. B. Kneer
are drilling nightly at B'nal B'rith Hall.
There was a rousing meeting of the Re
publicans of the Thirty-ninth Assembly
District at Saratoga Hall, 814 Geary street.
Wednesday night. The members of the
Central Republican Club desire it- to be
known that there is no boss holding the
lines or directing the course of the club
or its members. It has 323 members on
its roll, and its motto, is for the Republi
can ticket from first to last.
DEMOCRATS ORGANIZE CLUBS.
Permanent organization of the Bryan
and Stevenson clubs of the various As
sembly districts of the city was effected
last night, in accordance with the plan of
the County Central Committee. In most
of the districts the tickets supported by
the temporary officers appointed by the
organization committee of the County
Central Committee were elected with lit
tle or no opposition, but In a few club or
ganization had been effected prior to the
work of the County Committee, and some
confusion resulted.
In the Thirty-llrst Assembly District
particularly there was a spirited contest,
that threatened to end in a Donnybrook
fair melee. The friends of Tim Treacy.
who is a candidate for nomination for
State Senator, had organized early and
felt aggrieved at the plan of organization
emanating from the Ccunty Central Com
mittee. However, they put a ticket in the
field and attempted to capture the regular
club.
The meeting was held at Teutonia Hall,
1320 Howard street. After the polls were
closed a burly partisan of the regular or
ganization precipitated a row by Insisting
on casting his vote. In a moment the lit
tle platform was crowded with excited
men crowning, shouting and gesticulating
wildly. During the rumpus some of the
Treacy partisans tried to steal the ballot
box. Sergeant "Wolf nnd a squad of po
licemen held the ballot-box kopje against
the surging crowd.

â¢ The chairman was Instructed to appoint
a committee of three from each precinct
I was sent for. Conroy's relative, whose
name is Johnson, hunted me up and
peremptorily oraered me to appear be
fore Conroy and adjust 'matters. I had
had enough of Conroy and refused to obey
the command. Johnson then pleaded with
me to meet Conroy regarding the matter,
but I refused. I have witnesses to bear
out my position in this matter and I do
not propose to be caught in a trap. Hence
I will remain away from Eddie Conroy's
office and see the game through to the
finish.
Says Pass "Was Given Him.
"He says he never spoke over fifty
words to me in his life. This is palpably
false on its face. I can prove that in one
instance he secured me a. pass to Los
Angeles, and such favors are not gen
erally conferred upon those whose friend
ship has been clinched with a conversa
tion Involving the exchange of but fifty
words. He knows why he secured me
the pass and so do my witnesses. I feel
secure in the strength of my own position
and will await results. My witnesses are
ready and hence I do not fear that he
will force me to produce them in an ac
tion at law or other official Investigation,
for he is aware that the truth cannot ue
beaten down even by one in the exalted
position he now occupies."
The only man who came at all near set
ting his money back was Peter'Dann. He
was going to Everts, up the coast, on a
job, and he called on "Wilbur, and told him
he was going away. lie asked Wilbur to
give him his money back and offered fio
to Wilbur as an inducement to get it for
him. Wilbur told him he had paid the
money over to Conroy and could not give
it back. He said he would if he could, and
he would not accept anything for It, but it
had passed out of his hands. Wilbur told
one man he was going to got the last $25
note of each man for his share in the deal,
and he tout another that 5 per cent was all
he was going to get. It had probcibly
dwlndlod from the former to the latter
figure in the interim. His present esti
mate of his share is still lower.

Duped Carpenters Reiterate
Their Story of Giving Coin
to Get Places.
by E. D. Wilbur," said he. "I do not know
\\ llburâ that is. speaking in the known
acceptance of the term. I have seen him
a few times when he called at this office
in search of Information, but our con
versation has been limited to not more
than fifty words. The most contempti
ble, slanderous, unwarranted attack
based upon the affidavit of a man I know
to be a lying scoundrel has been directed
against me, and the end has not yet ar
rived, but I will be well understood when
it does come."
Conroy's affidavit is a denial, generally
and specifically, of every allegation that
he had anything to do with the collec
tions which Wilbur wa-s so assiduously
making; and he denies, too, that no knows
Wilbur.
Wilbur Reiterates Charges.
E. D. Wilbur wandered through the city
yesterday anxiously watching for a man
with a gun, who, reports said, was after
him. "1 suppose I will get the gun be
fore the day is over," he said, "but you
may rest assured that I will get the right
end of it before it speaks. My connection
with this affair is perfectly clear. I have
a witness who "saw mo pay Eddie Conroy
$50 on account of the water front car
penter'jobs, and again all of those who
paid me money on account of their con
tracts followed me to his offices and can
testify that it was through that office that
the scheme was" being worked.
"A short time ago. when the demands
of those who had been promised positions
on the front bogan to grow too numerous.
the carpenters was called in the Palace
Hotel. When* all had gathered Tate went
up to Conroy's office and told him the
men were ready for a final settlement He
asked that they all come up, â¢ and they
did, and conferred with Conroy in his of
fice. He had told them they- would have
to- wait a little longer, for -when Burns
left he had given orders that when it
came to filling the places in the harbor
service he wanted to be here himself and
have a hand in it, but it had come to such
a pass that the men would wait no longer
and they wanted a settlement. They got
no satisfaction, however, for all Conroy
would say at the meeting was that Burns
was sick and nothing could be done until
he recovered. Tate was asked to go to
see him, but instead it was decided to
write a letter. Ferren wrote the letter
end Perry took it out to Burns' house.
He was told the colonel was too sick to
see him: he sent the letter in and the
servant returned with the 'message that
the colonel was too sick to write a reply.
Perry had left his address in the letter,
but he never got an answer. Instead, the
sick, man rose from his bed the next dav
and departed from the ci'ty. He has ncTt
returned since then.
Conroy Rests on His Affidavit.
Conroy Was asked to make a statement
In regard to the case yesterday, but he
declined, and used up another fifty words
in explaining his private opinion of Wil
bur.
"I have nothing to say in addition to
that which is contained in my affidavit
which now stands against that sworn to
E. D. WILBUB, WHO SAYS HE PAID THE MONEY TO CONROY.
Said Burns Was Sick.
A week ago Sunday last a meeting of
Sought Secretary in "Bunches."
The calls on Conroy were made by the
carpenters in "bunches." They had more
than one straight heart to heart talk with
the colonel's secretary," and they gave
him morethan one unpleasant half hour.
They demanded their positions or their
money, and he put them off until, , tired
of their importunities, he sent for the book
containing the list of eliglbles. . It was
brought to him by Forbes and he took it
and showed where, among the presum
ably elect, were the names of Tate. Perry
and Fallon. The carpenters did not ask
how their names came to be on the list
if Wilbur was a liar and a scoundrel and
Conroy was ignorant of all his dealings,
for they thought they knew. They had
dealt with no one but Wilbur, and they
thought they knew how their names got
upon the list, so they asked no questions
and Conroy said nothing further on the
subject.
Tne carpenters' connection with Wilbur
ran through many months and a host of
promlsws, but through it all they believed
lit- was doing what he couid to keep his
questionable contract, and they say so to
this day; but there was a hitch some
where, and everybody, even Conroy,
passed It up to the colonel for a settle
ment.
When \\ uour was approached by Tate
and Perry, the first to enter into the deal,
he told them frankly he could get them
positions, but it 1 would cost them $100
apiece. Fifty dollars of this was to be
paid in cash, $25 out of the earnings of the
iirst month and $25 out of the earnings of
the second. There was no attempt to
conceal the fact that a necessary prelim
inary to the appointment was the pay
ment of the money, but it was designated
as "campaign expenses." to be used- In
the extra session then being agitated for
by the Burns forces. There was no
thought that it was to be used for the
furtherance of any but the Burns inter-
handed the money to Wilbur in front of
Co2 Market street, just opposite the Crock
er building, where Burns' -office Is located
and where Conroy holds forth. Wilbur
took the money and headed for the Crock
er building. He entered the elevator and
disappeared upstairs. When Ferren paid
his money he save it Into the hands of
Wilbur in about the same place, and again
Wilbur headed for the Crocker builuuig
and took the elevator for the upper floors.
And when McKerricher paid his fifty to
Wilbur, Wilbur once more headed for the
Crocker building and took the elevator.
In all there was several hundred. dollars
paid over to Wilbur in a time Including
out a few months, yet during that time
he was so poor that he borrowed money
to buy meci.cine for his sick wife; when
she aled she %vas buried with money
loaned out of campaign funds; when he
wanted to go to ban Diego to visit his
pick mother he received a pass from Con
roy, containing the remainder of the fifty
words, as far as txÂ»s Angeles, and he had
to borrow the money to take him on to
San Diego and back to Los Angeles, from
where he could use Conroy's pass again.
Conroy, it was- reported, secured the pass
through State Senator lioey. And during
an the time he was getting this money
from the carpenters Wilbur was borrow
ing from all the friends who would lend,
and he was as impecunious a politician as
politicians well can be. He said he gave
ail the money to Ccnroy.
TO the oxtent of throe hundred words
and an attested signature, Eddie
Conroy has denied that he ever re
ceived any of the money paid to
E. D. Wilbur by carpenters peek-
Ing positions in the service of the Harbor
Commission. He takes occasion to pass
some caustic criticisms on the Wilbur
recorii ar.d he swears he never spoke more
than fifty words to Wilbur in his life; yet
It Is well known that he and Wilbur wore
onoe friendly enough for Conroy to secure
a pass to Los Angreles for Wilbur, and on
more than one occasion he has allowed
the last named to refer to him as a friend.
From the very first, so the duped car
penters state, they believed that while
they were dealing: with Wilbur they were
to receive their jo'os from Conroy. They
taxed him witn it within the la.Â«t
month, and he had only this advice â that
If they would see the "colonel"âBurns
be would fix the matter all right. Conroy
denied that he ever received any of the
money, but he strongly advised silence in
the matter and said Burns would fix j
everything tu the >>atlsiactlon of every
body.
The relations of the carpenters with ]
Conroy are not more than six Â¦weeks old. ]
They called upon him in the early part of j
June. \\w rim time, arid before an hourj
and a half had passed Conroy had told'j
i-'orl>es Â«nd Forbes had told Wilbur and
Wilbur ;.osted down to Tate's house and j
told him to kÂ«:t those carpenters away I

Carpenters Call on Conroy.
Tho carpenters were not satisfied, how
ever, and they called on Conroy a train.
They asked him when they were point to
get those Jobs they had paid for. and he
faid they would have to wait until Burns
returned from the country. They de
manded the return of their money, and
Â¦with much indignation Conroy declared
he had never sorn a nickel of it. and then
ho told them that the colonel had lost JGoO
in a poker frame the rJpht Ivfore and he
would not stick at making good the
amount they had "subscribed." They
spoke freely of Wilbur to Conroy. and the
4ast named always* grew eloquent over
â¢Wilburs iniquity, an attitude that lost
its force one evening, when, after Con
roy had been particularly outspoken in
his opinion cf Wilhur. that gentleman
came to Tate and told him of the roastlne
he had been friven. He said Conroy told
him all about it. Conroy must have used
at least thirty-five of those fifty words
mentioned by him in parsing Wilbur this
description. And then, when Conroy went
down to Lrf-is Angeles to see the Governor,
the carpenters knew he was groins down
there four days before he started, and
they understood that one of the matters
taking him south was to see what could
l>e done for men who were entitled to po
sitions along the water front. They told
Conroy they knew of his trip before he
started, and he ktcw- angry and said some
one was lalklnjc too much.
In the whale transaction Conroy is con-
Fjiicuously and aggressively Innocent.
None of the carpenters ever saw any
money paid over to Conroy by Wilbur.
