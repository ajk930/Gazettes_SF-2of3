PLACES NO FAITH IN
CHINESE AUTHORITIES
ST. PAUL. M!nn.. July 22.â W. N
Lovatt. who spent forty years Jn the cus
toms service in China. Is in this city. In
an interview to-day Mr. Lovatt declared
his absolute disbelief .in the authenticity
of the telegram received at Wlshinpton.
signed by Minister Conger. He believes
the last authentic in-~rmation from any
of the legationers was the message from
the secretary of the German Lesratlon.
countersigned by Sir Robert Hart, ami
dated Jur.c IS. Mr. Lovatt says that Sir
Robert Hart was a favorite with the Chi
nese and the fact that no later message
has come from nlm means that every for
eigner In Peking has been killed, for 'f
any one could get a message out of Pe
king it would be. Sir Robert Hart-
Mr. Lovatt also discredits the storv
that the lesatloners found refuge behind
the palace walls. Of the general situ
ation, llr. Lovatt says all will depend on
the attitude of LI Hun? Chang, who has
heretofore been friendly and will probably
continue so.
*y HE report published in Sunday's Call that an appeal had been received by the United
*r States Government from China is confirmed by dispatches from both Washington and
Canton, where President McKinley is stopping. The exact character of the message is not
definitely known. Washington reports that the Chinese Government has appealed to the
United States to mediate with other powers to bring about a restoration of order and a re
newal of regular diplomatic relations. A telegram from Canton states that the appeal was
made to the Presid3nt personally. No reply has yet been'nrade, but the State Department
will assure Minister Wu of its benevolent intentions.
v- A. report: of the jnassacre^oUioreignecs jn^ekjng> has.reached-NiuGbwaag^^A-China
man who has arrived there, and who professes to have been a servant of a European in
Peking, states that he left the capital on July 12, on which date the envoys were, or had
been, murdered. On the other hand, there is a sheaf of Chinese assurances that the lega
tions are still safe. Yuan Shi Kai, according to one dispatch, now declares that "the
authorities are devising means for the rescue and protection of the legations." Other advices
represented the same official as wiring to the British Consul at Chefu that the legations had
been attacked, but were safe on July 11.
The story that the Dowager Empress is removing the court to Singan Fu. far away in
the interior, is revived with much circumstantial detail.
A provisional government has been established at Tientsin and a proclamation issued
bv the allies that they are not warring on China.
A full list of the American casualties at Tientsin is published this morning.
Minister Wu has advanced a proposition to deliver Minister Conger alive to Admiral
Remey.
THE CALL'S SUMMARY
OF THE CHINESE NEWS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Juiy 22. â Secretary
Long's attention has been called to the
condition of the ships on the Asiatic sta
tion. The reports received last Friday by
mail from Manila and Hongkong indicate
that the vessels of Rear Admiral Kempff - s
fleet arc badly in need of repairs of an ex
tensive character. It is possible that in
view of this showing the vessels now held
in reserve and in ordinary at League Isl
and and ether places will be dispatched
to the Ariatic station, replacing those
ships which require a great deal of over
hauling to put them into good condition.
There is every indication that the ships
under Kc-mpff will see Jcng service in Chi
nese waters, and while there is apt to be
no active work they must be in condition
for fast steaming and for making lor.g
trips. This requirement cannot be met
by most of the ships now on the station.
Constructor Hobson, who Is in a hospi
tal at Yokohama with an attack of inter
mittent fever, has written the chief con
structor in the same lir.e. He urges that
in view of probable demands to b<? made
upon our ships in Asiatic waters some
provision be made for replacing vessels
which have been on the elation continu
ously since the tattle of Manila.
DEARTH OF OFFICIAL
NEWS FROM CHINA
WASHINGTON. July 22.â With the ex
ception of the brief dispatch from Ad
miral Kempff announcing that the New
ark was going to Nagasaki, there has
been nothing received in Washington to

regarding China. This was also true of
the Chinese legation. Minister Wu saying
after dinner to-night that he had no wcrd

tinues extremely optimistic of the safety
of the legatloners in Peking, and hopes
that the dispatch from Minister Conger
received here c>n Friday is but the pre
cursor of more detailed information of a
still blighter character from the Chinese
camp. K " : if.-:
Many of his callers to-day inquired of
him about the report that China had
apked the United States Government to
exercise its good offices for his country
in the present crisis, but he declined posi
tively to make any statement on the sub
ject.
At the Japanese legation, which has
bf en a source of much of the news which
has recently come from China, the of
ficials also were without advices to-day.
Nothing has been heard at the legation
of the report published in the American
newspapers that the Japanese Govern
ment is about to dispatch -a second divi
sion of troops from Yokohama into Chi

yJjQASHIXGTOX, July 22.â Minister Wu has such confi
Â«**^ dence in, the genuineness of Conger's dispatch and such
faith :hat the Chinese Government is protecting the foreign
Ministers in Peking that he is said to have set on foot another
plan to demonstrate absolutely to this Government that the
American Minister is alive. This plan is startling in its incep
tion, and if carried out will present the most sensational episode
of this most dramatic situation. It is nothing short of a plan to
deliver Minister Conger into the hands of Admiral Remey at
Taku, that he may in his own person speak for the integrity
of the Imperial Government and tell the world the truth regard
ing the situation in Peking.
This proposition was so startling" that it has been met with
incredulity, but the State Department has been so impressed
by the Conger message that it now has confidence that Min

The fighting which has taken place since the capture of the na

Russians have taken Lutai, occupying the railway from Tong
Ku. A provisional government has been established at Tien

they are not warring upon China, but are suppressing rebels.
I have just visited Port Arthur. The general opinion there
is that the Russians are indisposed to spare more troops for
the Tientsin-Peking expedition, but will reserve them for the

the Empress Dowager and court are moving to Singan Fu. I also
know that several months past the present attack on foreign

to take the initiative. The Boxers would never have dared to
draw blood against absolute and determined opposition from
Peking.
"'Rice is now being brought up on the Haw and Tan
rivers to Singan Fu for imperial needs.'
"The American Consul here is pressing the Chinese to sup

they will take next, but it is said the
prosecution will not allow any evidence
that has a bearing- on the question as to
the man who fired the shot that killed
William Goelic-1 to come out in this trial.
Powers was indicted as an accessory be
fore the fact for conspiring with others
to murder Governor Goebc-1, and all of the
evidence as to the identitv of the assassin
is to be held in reserv? for the trial of Jim
Eefuse to Disclose Future Plans in
Prosecution of the Goebel
Case.
ATTORNEYS KEEPING
THE EVIDENCE SECRET
According to the latest official reports,
the country around Tientsin is clear of
hostile Chinese. The flower of the Chi
nese army in that section has been de
feated at Tientsin, and these army ex
perts calculate that Its power is so broken
that that particular army never can be
reorganized in season to offer formidable
resislance; so they agree that the time is
ripe for a stroke of bold generalship, such,
for instance, as French's ride to Klmber
ley.
. Further proof of an official character of
the mistake made by foreign commanders
in the attack on the Taku forts "is con
tained in a communication received at
the State Department from United
States Consul... Fowler at Chefu.
He 'has transmitted ' an ' imperial edict
Â¦which was supplied to him by telegraph
by the Chinese Governor of Shantung,
A particularly deplorable eifcct of the
reasoning of the European governments
on this point, in the estimation' of our
Government, is the abandonment of tho
Idea that there Is particular need for
haste and for taking even desperate
chances in the effort to get the Interna
tional relief column through to Pek'ng.
It is true that the latest advices from
Taku indicate that, whereas it was orig
inally estimated by the foreign command
ers that the expedition could not be start
ed before August 15, it Is now regarded by
them as possible to make a beginning
about the 1st of August. But the. military
experts here, who have been closely scan
ning ail the reports from Tientsin 'that ap
pear to be worthy of credit,' feel that even
now the way is open to Peking and that
tho march should begin with tne force at
present on the Peiho, leaving the powers
to bring up reinforcements to reopen the
base, should the first expedition be cut
off. â¢' . Â¦
Means Unnecessar;
Delay.
The point of difference between the
State Department and the European Gov
ernments is that the latter are proceed
ing on the belief that all of the foreign
Ministers and missionaries and guards at
Peking have been killed and Insist in
dealing with the Chinese Government on
that basis, thereby assuming a hostile at
titude that tends to destroy tho last
chance of availing of whatever friendly
sentiment may yet exist among the pow
erful Chinese Viceroys and the imperial
Uovernmtnt itself. Thus the French re
ply, as indicated in the four conditions
laid down by M. Delcasse yesterday, seta
an impossible task for the imperial Gov
ernment in Its present straits and tends
to drive it at once to make terms with
the Boxers and Prince Tuan's party.
On the other hand our Government,
while not guaranteeing the truth of the
advices from the Chinese Government as
to the safety of the foreign Ministers, is
willing to accept the statements tempor
arily, in the meantime remitting none of
its efforts to get access to Mr. Conger,
through the use of military force if need
be. By following out this policy the Stale
Department argues that it retains two
chances instead of one. It may reach Mr.
Conger with troops and also may secure
his deliverance through the friendly of
ttces of some of the powerful Chinese of
ficials, which the powers are not likely to
obtain for their own people by following
out their present policy, it may be stateu
also that the United States Government
has not and does not intend to relinquish
any part of its claim for compensation
and reparation in the ultimate settlement.
Its position In that respect, it holds, will
not be affected unfavorably by prosecut
ing Its efforts to make use of the friendly
sentiments of the Chinese officials.

what purports to be a direct
appeal from the Chinese imper
ial Government to use his good
offices to extricate that Government from
the position in which it has been placed
as a result of the Boxer uprising. Al
though the exact text of the appeal made
by the Emperor of China to France, as
outlined in the cable dispatches of yes
terday, has not been made known here,
it is believed _jf.at the dispatch to the
President is siv*Ilar in terms. In our cas e
the communication was made through
Minister Wu to the State Department.
Thus far a Hnal answer has not been re
turned. The French Government answer
ed at once, but that answer will not serve
us. The United States Government is
proceeding upon an entirely new line
of policy in the treatment of the case.
Unfortunately the State Department finds
itself alone in this, but nevertheless it is
convinced its plan is tiie best, and it has
behind it the consoling assurance that at
present all of the European Governments
have tacitly admitted that an error was
made in the beginning in* not following
the common sense advice of the United
States naval commander at Taku.
"An army of. 40,000 regular troops is all
that is necessary to take\Peking." he con
tinued. "The stories to the effect that the
Chinese have an army of 950.000 men are
rid'culous. There .'ire not more than 20 000
drl. 'od troops in China. The -rest are
poor..- organized "and poorly armed. if
they had mod<irn arms they would not
know how to use them, and they do not
constitute an effective fighting force."

"Knowing the Chinese as I do," said
Mr. Roberts, "I have little doubt that all
the foreigners in Peking were murdered
long ago. The Government power is weak
and the mob undoubtedly-, got the upper
hand. I know too much of what Chinese
mobs have done in the past to doubt that
they murdered the foreigners.

FORT RIL.EY.Kans., July 22.â Rush or
ders have come 1 for the Seventh United
States Battery of Heavy Artillery at Fort
Riley to tiroceed with all haste to the
Orient, calling for orders at Nagasaki.
General Merrlam promulgated the order in
Denver. The battery was organized dur
ing the Spanish war and since that time
has been idle. The equipment embraces
the heaviest caliber guns in the service,
with a full complement of mortars, the
battery being composed of 250 men and ten
officers. '^'>Â£
NEW YORK, July 22.â Two companies
of the Eighth United States Infantry
moved off the transport McClellan this
morning and started for .Fort Snelllng,
Minnesota. Other members of the regi
ment are en route from Cuba, and after
the recruiting of the organization to its
full number it will be sent to China. The
men have been in Cuba eighteen months,
but they looked to be in fine condition.
About 2500 persons were at the docks to
meet the soldiers, and the Young Men's
Christian Association provided coffee and
other refreshments. The other eight com
panies of the regiment were delayed by a
storm off Cape Hatteras.
MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS
ORDERED TO THE ORIENT
It can be stated on authority that the
President still feels the United States is
a favored nation in the fight of the Chi
nese officials' and he has not yet aban
doned the hope that Minister Conger and
other Americans in Peking will be res
cued, if not by the allied forces, by the
unaided efforts of the United States, first
through appeals to the Chinese Govern
ment and second by hurrying American
troops . forward to assist the Chinese In
quelling the rebellion, if such rebellion Is
not authorized by the empire.
There are only two contingencies that
can change this stand of the President.
The one is direct and reassuring news that
the Americans have not suffered in
China; the other that the Americans have
been butchered. In the event of good
news there will be less disposition to push
forward additional forces. Should the
worst reports be officially confirmed, then
every resource of the Government will be
taxed to secure proper reparation from the
Chinese Government. The Government
will use every effort to prevent actual war
between China and the United States and
will also continue to offer its good offices
to prevent international complications and
to preserve the integrity of the empire.
Not only is the President looking direct
ly after the situation in China, but ho is
also watching the trend of affairs
throughout the world, especially as they
affect the European powers directly con
cerned in the march on Peking^ Informa

PRESIDENT BELIEVES
IN CONGER'S SAFETY
A brief cablegram was received by Sec
retary Long to-day from Rear Admiral
Kempff at Taku. He announced that tho
Newark was going over to Nagasaki to be
docked and cleaned. Although he did not
say so, it is assumed that he is going
with her. as she is his flagship.
Five hundred United States marines
started from this city to-day direct for
China. They were placed on a special train
bound for San Francisco, whence they
will cross the Pacific in an army trans
port. This is the largest body of marines
that has yet been dispatched to the Orient,
and the departure was made conspicuous
by the presence of General Hey wood, the
commandant of" marines, and the full ma
rine band. Major Dickens commands the
detachment. vs&UgfQl
It is the intention of the administration
to withdraw, our forces, military and
naval, after the Americans in Peking have
been relieved and wash its hands of Chi
nese affairs, looking only to the preserva
tion of such privileges as It has a right to
retain for Americans,
The Governor of Peking and the Viceroy
of Chi Li are 'charged to issue instructions
to Investigate and then to deal intelligent
ly with each case of wrongdoing. The
edict states that recently evil-doers cre
ated riots, deliberately rebelled and mur
dered good subjects â certainly, it says, a
deplorable state of affairs. All Viceroys,
Governors and high military authorities
are ordered to obtain accurate details, pre
sumably of the, outrages committed by
Chinese, and to make such seizures and to
take such action as the cases warrant in
order to stop the disturbances.
The administration is determined to keep
aloof from any movement that would un
necessarily entangle the Government of
the United States in Chinese affairs. It.
of course, must join heartily with the
other powers in the effort to get to Pe
king, but it does not follow from that co
operation that it will be led into taking
part in the bickerings or dissensions that
ensue over the future of China after our
people have been taken care of.

and relates to the present hostilities be
tween China and the foreign powers.
Protection for Foreigners.
The dispatch containing the edfet came
to the State Department in such confused
phraseology that it is impossible to do
more than approximately state its sense.
The edict appears to state in beginning
that, owing to the trouble existing be
tween the Christians and the populace,
and to the subsequent seizure of the Taku
forts, which aroused the military to arms, ;
the imperial court was laying great
weight upon its international relations.
The Manchu generals. Viceroys and Gov
ernors are therefore ordered to ascertain |
whether the merchants and missionaries
of the various nations residing in the open
ports are being protected, and the asser
tion is being made that prefects and mag
istrates have sent repeated edicts to pro
tect the legations. Orders also have been
sent to the provincial authorities to pro
tect the missionaries. While hostilities
have not yet ceased, the Chinese officials
are directed to give protection to the mer
chants and others of the various nations
in accordance with treaties and must not
fail to obey. ,
The edict refers to the killing last month
of the Japanese Chancellor, Sugi Yama.
which it characterizes as startling. It says
that a short time thereafter the German
Minister was murdered while residing in
the capital conducting international af
fairs. The edict expresses the deepest
sympathy on account of his death, and
asserts that stringent instructions would
be issued to seize the murderer, who must
be caught and severely punished after the
termination of the present hostilities, to
ffether with those who have murdered for
eigners and missionaries or taken their
property without cause. The language of
the edict as given by Mr. Fowler on this
subject is very much involved, but it ap
pears to exempt from punishment those
who have killed foreigners "connected
with the war."

The Rev. John Hemphill, D. D., pastor
of Calvary Presbyterian Church, ad
dressed a large congregation yesterday
morning on the Chinese question, his ser
mon being mainly a defense of the mis
sionaries, who have by some been blamed
for the present Boxer uprising. The topic
announced was, "The Backward and For
ward Movements of History, With Special
Reference to the Present Uprising in Chi
na," and the text, from Numbers, xiv:23,
"To-morrow turn you and get you into the
wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
"The Israelites," said Dr. Hemphill, did
not reach the promised land in a straight
line, as the crow flies. They went for
ward, they stood still, they went around
and sometimes they went back. Here they
are at last on the borders of the promised
land, and God's command to them is to
get back to the point from which they
started. It was a wise command. A long
bondage had made them cowards as well
as slaves. They heeded the discipline of
the wilderness to make them brave
enough to cope with the giants who pos
sessed the land. They had the taint of
Egyptian idolatry upon them and needed
to be brought back to the simple mono
theistic religion of their fathers. So the
backward movement was a forward move
ment after all. The marchings and
counter-marchings of the Israelites in the
wilderness are typical of all the history of
our race. There have been forward and
backward movements all through it. We
have not reached our present high state of
civilization in a straight line. The light
has not increased continuously unto the
perfect day. It has been light and dark
ness and light again; progress like that
of the incoming tide, progress with fre
quent relapses, but progress on the whole.
"The present uprising in China seems
like a backward movement, but it is real
ly a forward movement. The wheels of
providence never go back. The prophet
Isaiah warned the people of his day not
to call good evil and evil good. I have no
desire to do so. Perhaps I feel the dread
ful things which have come to pass in
China as keenly as any of you. Shall we
call it a great calamity to civilization and
the cause of Christian missions? To short
sighted and timid reason It does seem like
a work of destruction, and that only: but
to the eye of faith it is a work of de
struction coming before a noble work of
construction. The hovels of Oriental pa
ganism must be torn down, that in their
place may gleam forth the temple of our
God.

July 22.â Two reasons are assigned
for the withholding by the War De

necessity of keeping the Filipino leaders
In Ignorance reRarding this Oovernment's
intention? and projected operations. It is
pointed out that this is the beginning of
the rainy season in the archipelago; that
it soon will be necessary for the American
troops to concentrate at garrison towns
and suspend field movements. The Fame
climatic conditions will force the Filipinos
to abandon th^ir brigandage and the next
few months should thus constitute a term
of rest. Should at this time the with
drawal of troops become known to the
ambitious colleagues of Aguinaldo it
would have the effect of not only prevent
ing a cessation of hostilities, but would
most likely lead to renewed outbreaks.
Later, say War Department officials,
Â¦when the islands are comparatively quiÂ«t
and the bolomen are ignorant of the in
tended weakening of the American forces,
further regiments may be sent without in
citing trouble and may be returned to the
islands before the dry season begins and
fighting can be renewed. It is claimed
that little time will be lost in this seem
ing d~lay. Fince the mobilizing of re?i

j'mude to either event.

There is the usual crop ot Shanghai
rumors at hand this morning. One Is that
Prince Tuan has been abducted and that

Another is that the notorious Kar.g- Yl.

appointed Viceroy of Canton.

lamation announcing that they ara not

The decision to keep the Indian division
at Hongkong is supposed to be dua to
the disquieting proceedings of the "Black
Flags" at Canton. It is reported that tho
Bogue forts are being rearmed by tho
Chinese with quick-firing Krupps and
large stores of ammunition and that tho
Chinese are mounting guns and laying
torpedoes at various advantageous points

All foreign women and children have

Chinese Frightened.
The Â» Shanghai correspondent of thÂ«
Daily Mail declares that the Chinese of
ficials are thoroughly frightened by tho
fall of Tientsin and desire to open ne
gotiations.
"Russia, however, la willing to maka
terms with Li Hung Chang, whose real
mission is to sow dissension among the
powers. The British. German and Amer
ican representatives were resolute against
receiving him."
Li Hung Chang's visit to Shanghai
seems to be a complete failure. Except
the Chinese customs officials, no one has
visited him. Shens. tho Taotai (Chief
Magistrate), gave the Consuls a cordial
invitation to meet him at luncheon, but
all declined.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily. Express pretends to have authority
for the assertion that Great Britain will
repudiate any credentials* Li Hung Chang
may bring from the Empress Dowager,
and he adds:
ONE bright San Francisco boy not only bore his part in
the taking of the Taku forts, but has lived to tell the
stirring tale. He is Arthur McLellan, the son of Mrs. E.
McLellan of 112% Oak street, now. serving as first-class
apprentice aboard the United States flagship Newark in the
'full belief that he will be homeward bound, by October 1.
In two letters received on Saturday by Mrs. McLellan her
son tells of his adventures in China, his ingenuous and brief
account of international # events being particularly young
American and refreshing. Under date of Taku, June 17} he tells
of the bombardment.
"We have been lying here three weeks to-day and are the
first ship in here nince last year. Since we arrived there have
been a number of men-of-war of different nations, until now
there are forty-seven of them in a row, and I tell you that all
of us 'couldn't do a thing' to China. â¢ â¢ â¢ Last night we
bombarded three China forts and it lasted from 1 o'clock in the
morning until 7:35 this morning before the Chinamen would sur
render. It was all their own fault that we 'put them on the
bum. as we asked them to surrender and they said no. So at
5 minutes to 1 all the ships commenced firing and it was some
thing awful to see the pigtail? flying in the air.
"They surrendered to the Russians, and the poor Chinamen
didn't like to do it. but it was compulsory."
In his second letter he describes the wounding of one of his
young comrades, John Welsh, also an apprentice on the New
ark "Welsh," he says, "was the last one of four men wounded.
Thev were carrying in the injured after the surrender, when a
shell broke over their heads from an arsenal near by. It killed
two and wounded John. He was hit on the jaw by a piece of
the shell, which was very small. It went through his cheek
and knockeu two of his teeth out. It did not hurt him at all,
but he will have a scar forever."
LONDON. July 23. 4 a. m.â Sir Chlh
Chen Loh Feng, the Chinese Minis
ter in London, took the unusual
step yesterday of paying a Sunday
"call at the Foreign Office. As Lord
Salisbury was absent the visit was without
special result, but its importance may be
gathered from an interview with the sec
retary of the Chinese legation. Sir Halli
day McCartney, in which the legation of
ficials seem to have assumed at last some
thing like personal responsibility.
Sir Halliday admitted that communica
tion had been practically reopened with
Peking and that messages from Sir Claude
Macdonald, the British. Minister, and the
other foreign Envoys might be expected
almost immediately. He said that he
hoped the trouble would soon be over,
since the Chinese Government was doing
its utmost to overcome the difficulties and
to control the lawless element. In his
opinion the Americans had taken the most
common sense view of the situation, and
he insisted that China ought not to be
misjudged. Against the suspicion that Li
Hung Chang had any but a sincere pacific
object in view he protested warmly, de
claring that all stories about the perfidy
and treachery of Earl Li were "abso
lutely baseless."
With regard to the prospects in the
southern provinces the secretary admit
ted that there might be small outbreaks,
but he said there would be pothing seri
ous and that Europeans 'would be -quite
safe in the treaty ports. The long silence
he explained as "due probably to thÂ©

Thus, according to the secretary of the
Chinese legation, a few days more should
bring a solution of the great mystery.
Nevertheless, no one in England believes
that the alleged dispatches and edicts are
anything but subterfuges to hide the real
situation as long as possible and to avert
retribution by sowing discord among thÂ©
powers. Â¦-Â¦:'Â¦ .
According to the Chefu correspondent of
the Daily Mall the fall of Tientsin has so
disheartened the Chinese that they are
seeking terms of peace. He says that
several attempts have been made to send
messages to Peking, but so far without
any known results, and adds that rumors
are again current that the Russians are
reaching Peking from the -north. It Is
impossible to confirm or deny these state
ments, but either one might explain
China's efforts to gain time.

SUDDEN DEATH OF A
WELL-KNOWN CITIZEN
Implicates Two Other Lads in Theft,
of Which They Claim to Be
k Ignorant.
D. Glannlnl, a fruit dealer at the corner
of Pacific and Jones streets, was robbed
of $150 in gold coin by his little eight-year
old son on Saturday. According to the
boy's story the theft was the result of a
conspiracy in which himself and two
other youths were Involved, but those
whom the lad charges with complicity
deny their guilt. A3 yet the police have
been unable to learn what was done with
the money.
About 1 o'clock Sunday morning Gian
nlnl i reported his 1O3S to the California
street Police Station. Policeman Ben
Kaskell was detailed on the case and soon
fastened the crime on Eddie, the
eight-year-old son of the fruit
dealer. The lad confessed. He said
he had seen the money in the bureau
drawer In his home and had told a num
ber of lads In the neighborhood about It.
He claims that the two other boys, aged
8 and 10 years, suggested that he take the
coin and that the trio would have a good
time with it.- Â¦ .
The police interviewed the accused boys
and they emphatically deny young Glah
nini's story. No arrests have been made.

THE treacherous tide and the shifting Â¦
winds of Lime Point brought sor
row to another home in this oity yes
terday. Ernest Gueldner of 121 West
Mission street and his son Tommy, S
years old, were the victims. David Mc-
Whirter cf 457 Valencia street and Otto
E. Makowski of 617 York street were res
cued by a mere chance. It was the same
eld story of men taking desperate chances
In dangerous waters for a m^ee of fish.
Their boa.t was capsized in the swirlirg

Wind arid tide in the chilly waters of the

The heroism of the father is the only
redeeming feature of the tragedy. In his
efforts to save his darling boy from death

they hired a boat from D. Koss and set
out about S o'clock. Nothing more was
seen of the party until Keeper Haltz

overturned boat with two men clinging to
the keel.
There is little possibility that the bodies
of Gueldner and his son will ever be re
covered. The tide was ebbing when they
went down, end still had some hours to
run, and the chances are that the bodies
were carried out to sea.

mUSSEL ROCK came near claim-
Ing another victim yesterday.
For seven hours the sea fought
to obtain hold of a man as he
lay helpless just about the sweep of the
breakers. The spume of the Incoming
rollers dashed over him and the wave3
reached for him, but never succeeded in
drawing him down, and at the last mo
ment the hardy boatmen from the South
side Life-saving Station took a line
out to the rock and brought the man in
through the surf. He had been for a swim
in the treacherous breakers that whiten
themselves against the cliffs below the
old Ocean House, and one of them picked
him up and flung him against the rock
like a chip on the surface*Â»f the sea. His
thigh was broken against the jagged
points, but he managed to hold on and
then to climb above the reach of the
green swells that swirled around the reef,
and there he lay until some one saw him
and called the life-savers to his assist
ance.
L. S. Mounts is the man . who came so
near being drowned in the surf. He is a
visitor In the city from Modoc, and during
his stay here he has been rooming at
910 "Polk street. Yesterday morning he
started for a ride on his bicycle, and,
aftes doing the park thoroughly, he took
their-s^aptalns sick. One of the masters
j was Injured while his vessel was loading.
| The other was taken sick three days'ago
| and had to be removed to a hospital as
I soon as the schooner docked.
The Free Trade left here on the 3th
inst. and made a long trip of It Uj> the
coast. She was bound for Coos Bay, bu*
head winds delayed her and on July 17
she had to run before a southwester. The
foresail, forestay and head trear were car
ried away and the- schooner had to be
squared away for San Francisco. Two
days later Captain Thorson was taken
sick and was still in a precarious con
dition when the Free Trade came to an
anchor. Captain Thorsoti was then taken
i ashore and his friends expect that a few
flays of careful nursing will see him
around again.
The Free Trade is trie famous vessel
that went in search of an island of gold
on the coast of Alaska. The English cap
italists who went north In the vessel were
marooned on Kodiak Island. They
I reached Seattle after considerable trouble
on one of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's Iwats and told a story of mutiny
and extortion. The captain who was in
command of the vessel sailed her down
to a small port in Oregon, where he soid
her and then disappeared.
The Free Trade was kept up north for a
time, but finally came back to San Fran
cisco and for some time past has been
engaged in the Coos Bay lumber trade.
The schooner, Mary Etta came In from
Bowens Landing in tow of the steam
schooner Navarro yesterday. While the
Mary Etta was loading. Captain Ander
son "was struck on the head by a falling
piece of lumber and had his scalp badly
cut. There was concussion of the brain
and other injuries, so it was thought bet
ter to have the Xavarro tow the vessel
down. Captain Anderson is still suffering
from his injuries and will not be ablef to
take the schooner to sea on her next trip
Busy Times on Transports.
There will be busy timee around the
transport wharf for the next week to
come. The Hancock docks this morning
and the work of loading her will begin at
once. She is scheduled to sail next Sun
day and will carry MO marines, three bat
teries of artillery and 350 recruits, all for
China. From here the Hancock will go
to Nagasaki and from there to Taku. If
the trouble in China is over before the
transport reaches Nagasaki the men will
be sent to the Philippines.
As soon as the Hancock is away the
Mead will go into the berth and she will
be rushed away also. %The Warren Is ex
pected in from Manila about August 1
and if it is possible she will sail again on
August 15. In the meantime the Aztec,
Strathgyle, Universe and Belgian King
will be loading mules and horses and sup
plies for the soldiers, so that the quar
master's department will have its hands
full for some days to come.
F. M. Srniti- Breaks Down.
The Alviso steamer F. M. Smith broke
her shaft Saturday in the slough and had
to be towed back to San Francisco by the
tug Annie. It will be several days before
s>he can be put on the run again and in
the meantime another sternwheeler will
be secured to take her place.
Walla Walla Sails.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
WaJla Walla finally got away for
Puget Sound ports yesterday morning.
She was to have sailed Friday at 11 a. m.
with over 300 passengers, but when she got
out in the stream a gasket blew out and
she had to return to the wharf. While
docking something went wrong with the
piston and it took two days to repair
the damage. In the meantime many of
the passengers got tired of waiting and
went north on the train. Those who re
mained by the ship were fed and cared for
by the company.
Water Front Notes.
N. Cohen, better known among the
transfer men and along the front as
"Duma Duma," will not be seen around
the Ferry building any more. The au
thorities have refused to issue him a li
cense and the police refuse to allow him
near the depot. On July 5 Cohen showed
Sergeant "Tom" Mnhoney a license which
purported to have been issued by the Tax
Collector. It was to run from July 1 to
October J and "Duma Duma" said he paid
the regular fee of $15 for It. Saturday
LJcense Collector Scott was around the
ferries rounding up the runners and de
manding to see their license. Cohen had
no license, but said it was at home. He
"was sent to get it. but came back-nnd
said it was lost. Sergeant Mahoney had
the number and particulars in his book
that he keeps. for reference, but Scott said
no such license had ever been issued and
that the one Cohen had shown the police
officer was a counterfeit. Cohen then
wanted to pay $15 for another license, but
Scott would "not accept it and warned
"Duma Duma" never to solicit business
on the water front again.
Now Commands the Planet Mars.
Captain John A. Bromley, who is well
known in San Francisco, having been here
many times in the British ships Cressing
ton and Toxtette. is now in command of the
large cargo steamer Planet Mars. The
latter is a new vessel, on her maiden voy
age and is 372 feet long, 4S feet broad and

RESCUING THE MAN FROM
MUSSEL ROCK.
the ocean boulevard and started south
ward. At the end of the boulevard he
turned down onto the beach and rode as
far as the cliffs that block further pro
gress. Just where Mussel Rock stands
boldly out about 100 yards from the
shore. Mounts was tired and hot and a
good swimmer. At that time, about 12:3"),
there was not much surf running, and so
he decided to take a swim in the breakers.
Mounts swam out as far as the rock
and tried to land upon It, but he could
find no foothold, for the waves played
with him and brought him out and threw
him back until one, bigger and whiter \
than the others, caught him and threw;
him agrainst the side of the rock with ter
rific force. He clung desperately to the j
slime and seaweed, and It was well he
did, for his thigh was broken and he was
helpless. As the wave drew away "he
lifted himself by the moss and the points
of rock, and gradually worked his way
out of reach of the rollers that tumbled
In after him. It was his only chance and
he made the best of it, but when he had
reached the top, sixty feet above the surf,
he could do no more and he lay exhausted
and unable to move. It wa* then about
1 o'clock.
Until half-past 3 the injured, freezing
man lay there In the wind and spray and j
then two pedestrians passed and noticed
him. They were William F. Delaney of
the American Biscuit Company and E. H.
Twight, a chemist in the employ of the
California Wine Association. They were
attracted by the peculiar actions of the
man on the rock. He would Bit up and
wave his arms and signal to the shore
and then he v.-ould fall back as If over
come by his own exertions. They watched
him for .some time. It became more and
more evident that he was In dire need of
help and they set about to devise some
means of getting him off. They shouted
to him, but he could not answer, or If he
could, what he said was drowned In the
roar of the surf. And so, as there was
nothing else to do. Twight threw off his
clothes and bravely ventured Into the
breakers. He swam out to the rock and
swam around It. trying to flnd some way
to get up Its steep side?, but he could find
none and had to give up the attempt.
Then the two men sent one messenpr
up the beach to the life saving station
and want themselves over to Colxna,
where they telephoned in to the Mer
chant's Exchange that there was a man
on Mussel Rock In need of heM.
The life savers lost no time In hurry
ing to the rescue. Captain Henry Smith,
chief of the station. Ole Bowling. Chaun
cey "Woodruff. Charles Peterson and Joh i
Felcher were the men who went to savj
Mounts. They took with them a Lyle gun
and line and a breeches buoy, but when
they got to the rock they four.d they
could not use them, as Mounts was help
less.
The rock is a long way from the station
and it was late when the latter was ca'.leii
upon for assistance. It was nearly dam
when the life savers reached the rock.
Ole Bowling and Chauncey Woodruff
are the men who swam out to the rock.
There was no such thing as having the
injured and benumbed man swim back
through the surf, so while Bowling and
"Woodruff lowered him down into thq
wash of the breakers Peterson ami Fol
cher made their way out from the shore
and caught him and brought him in.
Mounts was put Into a wagon at once
and was hurried up the beach to the llfo
savlng station. There he was given a hot
cup of coffee and more blankets were put
about him and he was hurried along to
InglesMe. The ambulance had been tele
phoned for. with directions to meet him
there, and he was taken to the hosplta!.

THE NATIONS AND THE ISSUE.
LONG ago it was known and said an army can
not be well commanded by a debating society,
and it is now becoming apparent in China that
the command is even less effective when intrusted to
an international council. The powers that meddled
with China in time of peace are now muddling in time
of war. The '.'concert of Europe" is seemingly no
better fitted to contend against Asiatic zeal at the be
ginning of the twentieth century than it was in the
days of the crusades.
For weeks the powers have been massing troops at
Tientsin, but after the first abortive attempt under
Admiral Seymour have made no effort to relieve the
legations and -.their Christian supporters at Peking.
In fact, according to a recent dispatch from Admiral
Remcy. the international column will not begin its
advance before the middle of August.
It is said that among the officials at Washington
opinions differ as to the cause of the delay. -Accord
ing to one opinion the foreigners in Peking have been
already massacred and there is therefore no reason for
haste in beginning the campaign. According to the
other there is so much friction among the command
ing officers that no agreement can be reached as to
what action should be taken. Our Government, it is
said,, has repeatedly urged a vigorous forward move
ment, and the Japanese are said to have offered to
send at once, an army corps to back it up, but the
urging has been in vain. The officers of the other
powers have decided to wait until "the roads are in
better condition."
Of course, the advantages that will accrue to the,
allies by waiting until they have larger forces and
the roads are better will be many, but the same delay
will give the Boxers time to strengthen their positions
and increase their forces, and to that extent the ad
vantages will be offset. Consequently it is very likely
the determination to postpone an advance movement
has been largely due to friction among the com
manders. Late accounts of the attack on Tientsin
attribute the hcavyMoss of the Americans to a mistake
of orders, and the mistake occurred in the transmis
sion of the orders from General Durward, the British
commander, to Colonel Liscum. Now, if a blunder
so costly can occur between officers of such rank,
who speak the same language and have a hundred
reasons for affiliating with one another in a foreign
Ir.nd, what is to happen when the French are giving
orders to the Germans, or the Russians giving orders
to the Japs?
Another reason for believing, in the theory of fric
tion at Tientsin, is the confusion that exists among
European diplomatists and statesmen on the, subject.
The confusion is so great that up to this time no na
tion has felt itself at liberty to "recognize a state of
war.'-' The Chinese have actually invaded Russia, and
the Russian Government has given the Chinese Min
ister his passports, but as yet war has not been de
clared. It te up to this time nothing more than a fr^e
fight, and a struggle for loot. There being no war.
there is no contraband law in force and accordingly
A SLACK SEASON IN TRADE
O LTHOUGH the markets still wear an aspect of
/ \ midsummer dullness there arc signs here and
tlicrc of renewed activity. These signs arc es
pecially marked on the I'acinc Coast, and particularly
in San Francisco, which will soon bustle with all the
business attendant upon the dispatch of troops and
supplies to the theater of a great foreign war. This
city is to be made the shipping point of most of this
business. Here horses, men, arms, ammunition,
clothing, provisions, camp paraphernalia, etc., will bi
collected and exported; and the familiar activity of
the days of the Spanish war will be repeated in our
streets. Thus, whatever the condition of national
trade may be, locally times will probably be brisk.
There are not many indications of the fall trade in
the East as yet. It is too early. Another month must
elapse ere the regular winter buying sets in. If hot
weather be protracted the vacation will last just â¢Â»<>
much longer. Still, :!ome increase in the demand for
goods is noted in the South, West and Northwest.
The staples arc generally without feature, there being
nothing new to report in wool, cotton, hides, leather,
Itoots and shoes and proVisions. Corn lias weakened.
c;:rryir,g hogs along with it, and wheat continues to
fag. with more pronounced talk of a 550.000.000 bushel
crop. The California wheat crop has been materially
reduced by hot weather, which pinched the grain while
in the milk, and all estimates are below those of a
month or so ago. Some observers think they see
j-igns of improvement in the iron and steel trade fol
lowing further reductions in quotations, and there is
growing talk that tlie market has about touched bot
tom. This, however, is mere speculation, though
rather more inquiry from Europe is reported^
The failures throughout the country last week were
2Q2. against 174 for the same week last year. The
bank clearings were 12.5 per cent lower, with alternate
pains and losses reported down the list of leading
cities. Chicago, Pittsburg. Cincinnati, Kansas City
::nd New Orleans showed a gain, but all the other
larpe cities showed a loss.
Wall street is ?lecpy and featureless, as usual during
the midsummer vacation. The public still keep out of
it and the professionals have it pretty much to them
selves, with the usual result of a dull market.
The local markets, like the Eastern, are devoid of
feature, though we feel the midsummer dullness less
rn this coast. Grains closed the week firmer, under
Tetter foreign cables and a local Government demand
for the army. Almost all farm products are bringing
[air returns, though several lines are dull at low prices.
Merchandise is reported in average movement for this
time of the year and prices, as a rule, are somewhat
higher than for several years. Collections are reason
r.bly easy and there are no large failures reported.
The supply of money is ample for all needs, and sol
vent borrowers have no difficulty in finding accommo
dation on ordinary securities. Otherwise there is
nothing to remark in the local situaton.

NEWS OF THE NAVIES
The Guichen. French cruiser of ton*,

has been ordered to proceed to China kt
high speed, and It is expected she will
make thÂ». voyage in thirty-five days.
The fatest Russian naval programme on
the Black Sea is four cruisers and foul
transports, to be built by the TJelg an
company at Nlcolaleff. Four destroyers
are ready for launching at the latter yard.
It is reported that some of the new Rus
sian cruisers are to have four-inch armor
protection over the greater part of their
bottoms. The idea is to protect against
torpedoes, which no doubt will not be re
alized in practice.
The Highflyer. British cruiser of Sf/O
tons, had a two hours' full power trial
June 20 and made a speed of 19 knots with
10,153 horsepower. The horsepower Moe^d
ed the contract by 1S5, but the calculated
speed fell short one knot.
Â¦ The Sultan, rated as a third-class bat
tleship and on the effective list of th<*
British navy, is to be located at the Fal
mouth torpedo station to serve as a depot
ship for torpedo craft. This is service fÂ»r
which almost any hulk would be suitable.
The British destroyer Shag made an av
erage of 20.343 knots during a three hours"
trial. She was light, drawing a fet 9*i
Inches forward and 7 feet l 1^ inches aft.
The steam averaged 213 pounds, revolu

The new VIckers 7^-Inch naval gun Is of
fifty caliber length and carries a projectiia
weighing 200 pounds, which, fired with a
charge of fifty pounds of cordite, attains
11.S25 foot tons. Its complete weight, in
cluding shield and mechanism, is sixteen
tons, the shield being three inches thick.
It can be elevated to sixteen degrees an 1
depressed to ten degrees, and six round3

The Japanese. fle*t assembled before
Taku consisted one month ago of fourteen
vessels, of 52.145 tons, carrying about 50^
men. There were seven armored and pro

three gunboats of 1933 tons and four de
stroyers of 1200 tons. The average age of
these vessels â barring the gunboats, which
Â¦were about ten years old â 'was less than
three years*and represents the very latest
in ships and guns, while those of ths
European fleets were in many cases bor

THE NEBRASKA U UGAR CASE.
THE recent decision of the Interstate Commerce
Commission in the complaint brought before
that body some years ago, known as the Ne
braska sugar case, is of interest to Pacific Coast mer
chants, inasmuch as it has a direct bearing upon one
of the specifications of the complaint now before the
commission from the St. Louis Traffic Bureau â that
oi graded rates. We refer to that part of the latter
complaint protesting against terminal points, and fa
voring graded rates.
The Nebraska sugar case grew out of a complaint
brought before the commission by the merchants of
Kearney, Neb., against the Unidn Pacific, Southern
Pacific and other transcontinental" railways, alleging
that said railways were making a lower rate on sugar
from San Francisco to Omaha than to Kearney, the
htter being situated some 150 miles nearer the point
of origin than the former, and both located on the
main line of the Union Pacific Railway.
The commission in its decision acknowledges the
establishment by the evidence offered of the following
facts: There are two lines of vessels from Honolulu,
the point whence raw or unrefined sugar is shipped
to the United States, one via Cape Horn to New
York or Philadelphia, to other to San Francisco.
Hawaiian sugar. is refined in all of these three cities.
The rate from Honolulu to New York or Philadel
phia by sailing vessel is so low that in combination
with the rail rate from the latter cities to Omaha
such through rate is accomplished as to force the
transcontinental railways to make a rate of 50 cents
per hundred pounds from San Francisco to Omah.i
or lose the business. Such competitive conditions are
r.oi found to exist at Kearney. The rate from San
Francisco to Kearney is, say, 85 cents, this being the
sum of the competitive rate from San Francisco to
Omaha, 50 cents, plus the â¢local rate of the Union
Facific Railway Company back to Kearney, say, 35
cents.
In the face of these findings the commission decides
that the rate from San Francisco to Kearney is ex
cessive, and orders that same be reduced to 65 cents.
The basis of this decision is that it is fair to presume
that the transcontinental railways are not carrying
sugar from San Francisco to Omaha at a loss, there
fore, accepting 50 cents per hundred pounds to be the
cost to them of the service between San Francisco
and Omaha, the cost of like service between San
Francisco and Kearney would not be greater; on the
contrary, would be slightly less, inasmuch as the haul
is some one hundred and fifty miles shorter; hence
a charge of 85 cents for the transportation of freight
costing something less than 50 cents is, in the opinion
of the commission, excessive, 'unfair and unreason
able.
That the enforcement of the commission's decision
is fraught with danger to Pacific Coast interests will
be seen at a glance. Whereas now the rates from
Atlantic seaboard and Middle West cities to points
situated east of Pacific Coast terminals, such as
Ellensburg and Walla Walla, Wash.; Pendleton and
Baker City, Or., and Triickee and San Bernardino,
Cal., are in most instances based on transcontinental
sea competitive terminal rates, and the local from the,
nearest terminal added, under the .decision in this
case the basing rate would be accepted as the maxi
mum cost of the service, and rates would be estab
lished to intermediate points which,' in the opinion of
the commission, would pay the carriers a reasonable
profit, regardless of the local rates in force. The
jobbers in the terminal cities would thus be placed in
a most unfortunate position, inasmuch as the same
commission is powerless to maintain said- jobbers'
relative position with respect to the trade of the towns
affected by ordering a corresponding reduction in
local rates, the Interstate Commerce Commission
having jurisdiction over interstate rates only.
The logical result of the establishment of a rate
making principle such as outlined in the Nebraska
sugar case decision would be to curtail the distribu
tion by the coast" jobbers pf goods originating on the
Missouri River and cast thereof to the confines of
the jobber's own city, inasmuch as it is plain that the
Middle West jobbers would have a decided advantage
in all intermediate territory.
i HAVE read with interest the published
I statement in The Call of Attorney
I Pillsbury. who represented before the
Board of Equalization certain corpora
tions that objected to the assessment of
their franchise* as made by the Assessor.
In reply to his statement I submit for the
consideration of taxpayers the following:
Every good citizen must agree that
when a public official takes his oath of
office he is bound to enforce the law as he
finds It. and the remedy of those who feel
aggrieved is to have the law amended,
contest its legality in the courts or submit
that the right of the majority to make
and enforce laws is the correct principle
of government. In my official position as
Assessor I assessed according to law the
franchises of corporations. To this action
certain corporations objected, and em
ployed an attorney to contest the assess
ment before the Board of Equalization.
Naturally one would think a lawyer ap
pearing before such a board would plead
"law," but instead of doing so Attorney
Pillsbury presented no legal authority or
decisions of courts to sustain his position,
but instead of that makes a threat. He
says practically: "We are a favored class.
I ask you to i^ake an exception of the
corporations represented by me. If you
tax us for our franchise we will move
away." After finding but two votes in the
board who were at all influenced by his
argument the attempt Â»s then made to try
the case In the newspapers.
In his published statements he questions
the actions of the Assessor rather than
the law involved, or the Board of Equali
zation, who had the authority if he pre
sented good reasons to grant his request
and cancel the assessment.
Before Boards of Equalization in adjoin
ing counties when Attorney Pillsbury Is
pleading for a reduction in corporation
assessments he makes the statement that
the action of the Assessor in San Fran
cisco is driving capital away.
To this charge I will answer, first, that
It has been my endeavor to enforce the
law as I find it. This franchise tax has
been upheld by several decisions of the
Supreme Court of this State and by a
number of decisions of the United States
Supreme Court. In one of the latter de
cisions Justice Miller lays down the law
as follows: "It is obvious that while a
fnir assessment of a corporation may in
clude all the tangible property. It may not
include all its wealth. There may be prop
erty of another class not visible Or tangi
ble, which ought to respond to taxation
and which the State has a ripht to subject
to taxation, and which ought to pay Its
share of the taxes. This element the
State of Illinois calls the value of the
franchise.
That the franchise, the capital stock,
business and profits of all corporations
are liable to taxation admits of no dis
pute at this day. "Nothing can be more
certain in legal decisions," says this
court. " than that the privileges and
franchise of a private corporation may
be taxed by the State for the support cf
the State Government." This is the law
as established by the highest court in the
personal property, including household
furniture, merchandise, solvent credits,
money and franchises. The total fran
chise assessment, exclusive of the quasi
public corporations, is less than ?J.onO.Wc.-.
There Is $1^,000,000 of non-taxable bonua
still listed on the San Francisco Kxehansj
to select for investment, to say nothing cf
over J2W.0OO.WX) of stocks listed on the ex
change. It is an attempt to make ina
holders of these desirable securities pay
some tax that has led to this franchise
assessment. This compels the corporation
to pay the taxes on the stock held by its
wealthy stockholders.
Ihe prosperity of San Francisco depends
on that of the agricultural community t'f
this State to a great extent. If the monry
of the San Francisco banks and capital
ists was loaned to or Invested more freeiy
in farming or manufacturing Interests in
stead of being put so largely -in quasr
public bonds and stocks possibly business
In San Francisco would not suffer by tho
change. As this change would Increase
tne assessment roll the rate of taxes
would decline until San Francisco wouM
be the lowest taxed city in tne United
States. This would Invite capital to San
Francisco Instead of driving it away.
Section 15, article 12 of the constitution
of the State of California provides "that
corporations organized outside of th>>
State of California shall not be allowed
to transact business within this State <>u
more favorable conditions tnan are pre
scribed by the law to corporations or
ganiied under the laws of this State."
It Is just possible that by organizing in
Oregon or any other State a corporation
may not escape just taxation in Cali
fornia and that for the privilege of doir.fr
business In this State they mav be re
quired to pay a just proportion of taxe.-.
At any rate, the argument that we shouM
not tax some corporations because they
threaten to move away and thus deprive
San Francisco of some money which
otherwise might be expended here la na
more reasonable than It would be to con
tend that taxes against rich men for per
sonal property should be remitted, fcr
many of these do take up their reslderw-i
out of San Francisco in order to avoH
being taxed. On being- requested by tho
Assessor to make a statement of their
personal property. Including moneys an'l
solvent credits, they claim residence In
adjoining counties. When, however, trie
taxe? paid by them In adjoining counties
is ascertained It is found they are paying
on household effects only. To use thu
argument of Mr. Pillsbury. then let ua
exempt our rich citizens who can affonl
to move away from all taxation on per
sonal property. In the hope that they wl".
maintain their residence here as well Â»i
their business, and thus biÂ»n*Â»flt Rat
Francisco by disbursing th*Â» money which
a home her* would necessitate. This fs
practically the argument that corporation
attorneys advance In behalf of the cor
porations they represent.
Shall we abandon the principle Involvprt.
ignore the law. do injustice to the manr
that a favored few may escape taxation
simply because It Is withfn their power
to run away and thus escape the payment
of a fair, equitable and just tax? Never!
WASHINGTON DODGE. Assessor.
land. Can any language be more explicit?
And yet our Attorney General gravely as
serted that he objects to the taxation ol
franchises because this puta a tax on in
tangible property!
The charge that capital is being driven
from San Francisco by this attempt to
enforce the law of our State is based on
an alleged attempt of two corporations to
organize under the laws of the States of
Oregon and Washington. One of these
corporations is the Sunset Telephone, of
the State of California, acting with the
Interstate Telephone Company dolnsj
business In Oregon and Washington.
These corporations propose to organize
a trust corporation that will include anci
direct all its sub-companies on the entire
Pacific Coast, the headquarters of tne&e
consolidated corporations to be in Oregon.
At present the telephone business in ban
Francisco is done by the Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph Company of Cali
fornia, which does not propose to ruu
away. The telephone business outside of
San Francisco is done by the Sunset Tele
phone Company. The statement of At
torney Pillsbury that they will take their
five hundred employes to Oregon la ab
surd. It has no employes in san t ran
Cisco to speak of. The company does nut
intend to move its poles and lines to Ore
gon, or relinquish its revenue obtained
from the good people of the State of Cali
fornia, nor will it cease to ask for the pro

FRANCHISE ASSESSMENTS DEFENDED.
EXPERIENCE IN CONGRESS
\A ANY times has The Call had occasion to point
/ \ out to the people of California the importance
of maintaining at Washington a delegation
composed of men who have had experience in Con
gressional service and have acquired a personal in
fluence with the leaders of their party and with Con
gressmen generally. ' New men in any line of endeavor
are handicapped by the very fact that they are new.
Other things being equal the man of experience in any
line of business is >vorth more than the newcomer.
California interests at the national capital^ have suf
fered in the past because the people have so fre
quently changed their representatives; because so
many members of the Stnte delegation neither knew
the leaders of Congress nor were known to them.
The contest now going on in the Third District for
the Republican nomination renders it necessary to re
peat the counsel so often given. The Republicans
there arc called upon to determine whether the pres
ent member. Mr. Metcalf. who has rendered good
service and has acquired experience and acquaintance
ship in Congress, shall be renominated and re-elected,
or be set aside for a new aspirant, who, in spite of
whatever personal good qualities he has. will enter the.
House ignorant of its methods of doing business and
without any extensive acquaintance and influence
among its members.
The leading competitor against the present repre
sentative is Henry P. Dalton, a man who is justly
popular among his fellow citizens of Alameda County,
and whose political record attests his efficiency in the
public service 1 . Against him personally The Call can
have no objections; but to support him in the contest
he is now making would mean the denial to Mr. Met
calf of that indorsement which his fidelity in Congress
has merited, and to deprive the Republicans of the
Third District of the service of an experienced repre
sentative for the purpose of substituting a new man
in the office.
It is, of course, understood that when a Congress
man docs not represent the views of his constituents
on great policies of government he should be set aside.
A conservative constituency whose welfare is depend
ent upon the maintenance of sound finance and pro
tection should not s end to Congress a man who will
vote for free silver or fiee trade, but where there is no
question of party policy at stake a constituency is fool
ifh when it dismisses a representative of experience
for the purpose of '"giving a new man a chance."
During his term of service Mr. Metcalf has won thw
esteem of his colleagues and the favor of the leaders
of his party. That, was made evident by the statements
published in The Call yesterday from Congressman
Loud: Judge McPhcrson of Iowa, who sat in the last
session of Congress with Mr. Metcalf; Senator Foster
of Washington and Speaker Henderson. Of thes^
statements that of the Speaker is worth requoting.
because it comes from the man who. in all probability,
will be Speaker during the next Congress and assign
its committees, and who. moreover, speaks with the
authority of a long experience in Washington.
Mr. Henderson said: "It seems impossible that
there should be any doubt as to Mr. Metcalf s return.
It would be a very great mistake not to return him to
liis peat in Congress. Mr. NT et calf is an ffirnest. con
scientious, intelligent and untiring worker. Califor
nia has never sent to the Congress of the United
States within my recollection a man who in his first
term has achieved such an enviable standing as has
Mr. Metcalf, and it will be unfortunate, not only for
the Third Congressional District but for the State of
California, if he is SOt returned."
In the Eastern s States the people have long since
learned the value of re-electing faithful representatives.
In many constituencies in the South and in New Eng
land such men are kept in Congress for life, and as a
result those States have a prestige in national affairs
altogether out of proportion to their wealth and their
population. Iowa is one of the few Mississippi Val
ley States that re-elect good men term after term, and
the result is she now has the Speakership. "ft is time
for California to learn the lesson.
any one who wishes to get rich by selling arms anil
ammunition to the Boxers has a right to do so.
The concert of Europe is in need .of. a leader.
There is only one man of sufficient rank to take com
mand without exciting jealousies, and that is Kaiser
William! He has frequently proclaimed himself a war
lord, and now is the time'for him to get to the front.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, July 22.â Judge J. R. Me-
Farlan. founder of the town- of Dehesa, In
this county, died early this morning from
the effects of injuries sustained in a run
away accident yesterday afternoon.
He had driven to El Cajon with a spir
ited team of horses 'and started on the re
turn trip about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
When about a mile and a half out of El
Cajon his horses became frightened and
unmanageable, and on account of his
advanced age, 70 years, he was unable to
control them.
While going at almost breakneck speed
the horses dashed the carriage against a
tree, and Judse McFarlan was thrown
with considerable force to the ground.
His head struck a rock and he was ren
dered unconscious. Several persons saw
the accident and ran to the assistance of
the Injured man. He was carried to a
doctor s house, and although everything
r)ssible was done for his relief he*died at
o'clock this morning without having re
gained consciousness.
Judge McFarlan came across the plains
In 1S50 and settled first at Downieville.
where he lived until ]S69. when he came to
San Diego County and founded the town
iof Dehesa. He leaves a widow and one
"son.

JUDGE MTARLAN LOSES
HIS LIFE IN A RUNAWAY
when Mr. Wu proposed to give him further evidence of Chinese
good faith by producing the American Minister himself.
Secretary Hay said that, in view of the incredulity of all
European powers .and the apparent inevitability of a general hos
tile movement against Peking, only the presence of one of the
Ministers at Tientsin or some other place outside Peking
would relieve this sit^tion - and check a forward movement.
Wu thereupon volunteered to undertake, through his friends
in China, to have the American Minister delivered to Remey at
either Tientsin or Taku, and in this way demonstrate that the
Imperial Government had throughout this trouble given pro
tection to the foreign Ministers.
It is not known by what means the Chinese. Minister ex
pects to carry out the plan, but it is supposed he will enlist the
services of the Governor of Shantung and Prince Ching,
through whom he succeeded in getting the cipher dispatch
from Minister Conger v The proposition is so startling it has
~been kept a profound secret by the State Department, but it is
given on creditable authority. If it succeeds, Conger will be able
to lay before the world the whole situation at Peking, and it is
hinted from Chinese sources that this may show the Imperial
Government in a better light than it has at any time appeared
since the trouble began, and also reveal that there have been
international provocations which have helped to create a con
dition of anarchy in Peking.
It would be a remarkable 'demonstration of friendship for
this Government if the Imperial Government should assist in
carrying out this plan to produce Minister Conger, as the rep
resentative of the one friendly power which has no designs upon
Chinese territory. It would probably excite the bitter enmity of
other powers, but it is possible there have been faults in Pe
king" not of Chinese origin, and that the Chinese may have had
reason to believe the foreign powers were taking advantage of
domestic troubles and anarchistic conditions to overthrow thef
Imperial Government and divide up Chinese territory among
themselves.

WAGON OVERTURNS AND
THREE ARE INJURED
LONDON, July 22.â A dense fog hung
over the Irish Channel yesterday morning
and the Cunard line steamer Campania,
en route from Xew York for Liverpool,
struck the Liverpool bark Embleton,
bound for New Zealand, amidships, cut
ting her in twain. The Embleton sank
Immediately.
Seven of the crew were rescued, but it
is believed the other eleven members of
the ship's company, including the captain,
were drowned. ,
The Campania had her bows Btove in,
but arrived safely at Liverpool five and a
half hours late.
The Campania was little Injured, but
had a narrow escape from serious disas
ter. The fog had delayed her passage
since Friday noon, and a tender went out
from Queenstown four miles, as Captain
Walker would not take the liner near
shore. - At Tuskar Light the fog was be
coming denser every moment. When the
Campania was about thirty miles north
east of the light a phantom ship rose sud
denly, without warning, directly across
her bows. Thirty seconds later the phan
tom had become a solid sailing vessel, into
which the liner crashed, her steel fore
foot going through the Embleton like the
clean cut of a sword and dividing her just
abaft the mainmast. The forward half
sank instantly. The stern swung viciously
round and the mast and yards for a mo
ment tore at the Campania. A lump of
wreckage came down on her decks. Then
the stern of the bark also disappeared and
the face of the sea was littered with
splintered timbers, boxes, barrels, the
whole upper works and lighter cargo, the
deckhouses and such things.
From the Instant when the phantom
came into view from the bridge of the
Campania until the last vestige of the
vessel vanished some sixty or eighty sec
onds had elapsed.
According to the Embleton's survivors,
for nearly half an hour before the col
lison the captain and first officer were be
low at breakfast, and although the fog
whistle of a large steamer could be heard
every minute, the bark never shifted her
course, the helmsman receiving no orders.
When, at 8:25 a. m. f the second officer,
to usÂ« his own phrase, "heard the rush of
a steamer's bows," he shouted down to
the captain, who rushed on deck, but he
was too late to give an order.
The Campania was under one-third
steam. The captain, first officer and pilot
were on the bridge. The engines were In
stantly reversed and the helm put hard
down. No precaution was omitted. Some
of her pasengers had even grumbled at
what they called FupÂ»riiuous caution.
After the crash and the sudden cries the
boats were quickly got out. There were
no signs of panic: the members of the
crew were everywhere at their stations
and the best discipline was maintained.
The bulkheads were closed and every
thing possible was done to save life.
Some of the Campania's plates were
bent by the collision: her forepeak filled
with water; her foretopmast was broken
short on* and her steel rigging torn and
twisted. ,
The passengers held a meeting, adopted
resolutions of thanks to the captain and
crew and subscribed Â£700 for the relief of
the survivors and the families of the lost.
The Cunarder officials announce that the
damage suffered by the liner will not
prevent her sailing for the United States
next Saturday.

wagonloads of barley, and landed in the
County JaIL_
For some time farmers around here
have been losing barley from piles In the
fields, but no trace of ih> thieves could be

Constable Coleman of this place made
the discovery which led to the capture of
the men, who are brothers named Brady.
The officers lay In wait all last night at

LEXINGTON, July 22.â Professors An
derson and Muncle, under the direction of
Dr. Archie Barkley, are trying to locate
a bullet In the back of the famous race
horse starter and turfman, James B. Fer
guson.
Starter Ferguson is at St. Joseph's Hos
pital and search is being made for the
bullet by the aid of X-ray photography.
Last night two negatives were made, but
because of poor lighting the leaden mis
sile did not show. This afternoon the
men made two more exposures, but as yet
the plates have not been developed and
the result is unknown. Should they still
be unsuccessful it ls their intention to
take Starter Ferguson to the State col
lege laboratorv. where they are better
prepared for work. Dr. Barkley said:
"I am satisfied from his symptoms that
the missile is pressing upon some nerve.
He has constantly a tingling feeling in his
legs and Is partially paralyzed."
Starter Ferguson said to a correspond
ent: "I was in a stooped portion when
the bullet was fired into me, and believe
It certainly went deeper In than my
rplne. The first shot of Captain May, my
antagonist, struck me in the left hand.
The eecond look effect In my leg and 1
fell to the pAvement. He then ran up to
me and fired twice at close range, both
bullets strlklnc me In the small of the
back, Just below the kidneys... This was
twenty years ago, and until recently I
have suffered little from the wounds.".
Dr. Barkley says Starter Ferguson also
has congestion of the liver. ,

from "way back," having been a resident

Mr. Baird began life as a newspaper

been performed en the Pittsburg Dispatch.
He was bom In PittFburg forty-eight years

my life in the Rocky, Mountains. My of-
flclal life has been very agreeable and I
look forward to my new field of effort
with pleasant anticipation. I have not the
personal acquaintance of'Judge Estee, but
I have studied his ""Rules of Practice"
and corresponded with him until I feel as
though I enjoyed his friendship.
"Yes, I knew many of the noted charac
ters in my section of the country in the
past twenty years, among whom was Bill
Nye. Nye and myself were close friends
long before he began writing for the
newspapers. It was while he was a strug
gling Justice of the Peace that he gath
ered the material that enabled him to
write the stories that made the whole
world laugh and gave him fame and for
tune. He was a delightful companion,
and as a -health promoter better than aU
the doctors."
The new official will depart for Honolulu
on the steamer Australia on July 25. He
Is accompanied by his eldest son, Byron

Odd Plight of Gerhardt Oken, a
Wealthy California Rancher,
Now in the East.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOLEDO, Ohio. July -2. â Gerhardt On
ken, a rich California rancher, is sojourn-
Ing In .this city at present with a view to
ascertaining if a young woman whom he
met here through the medium of a "Per
sonal" and who left him in Chicago
thirty-six hours after they were married,
as he supposed, ls really his wife. In the
Police Court wnere he cnarged the lady,
Mi?s Louise Warrington. with "practicing
a trick with intent to cheat." the Judga
held that a^ there was a probability as to
whether the man who performed the al
leged ceremony was a Justice of the
Peace, there was a probability of mar
riage at common law. He therefore dis
missed the case on the ground that (.he
charge would not hold as preferred by
husband against wife.
But Onken had secured Miss Warring
ton's trunk and she sought replevin in
the city courts. There the Judge held
that there was no evidence of marriage
and that the lady was entitled to replevin.
To this decision Onken has taken excep
tion and will go to the Common Pleas
Court that his situation In a matrimonial
way may be determined. He is apparent
ly not very eager to make good the mar
riage which is repudiated and denied by
the lady, but would like to know whether
he ls married or single.

the laying of the cornerstone of St.
Mary's Cathedral in this city to-day in the
presence of a very large number of peo
ple.\The ceremonies were very Impressive.
Bishop Scanlan laid the cornerstone.
In his address the Archbishop paid
tribute to the men and the women off this
city whose generosity had made it possi
ble for what promised to be one of the
finest church structures in the country to
be built, and assured them that the bless
ings of the Almighty would follow them
through life.
The Catholic church, he said, was the
only one that had kept the true faith and
had followed the teachings of Christ for
1900 years. It was the only true church,
and It would last in Its new strength and
might as the rugged mountains by which
It was surrounded.
While a catholic structure and erected
under the auspices of that church. It
would not be exclusive, in that every
Christian sect would be welcome within
Its walls, while as a monument to the usÂ©
and progress of the Catholic church It
also typified the congress of Christianity.
The decorations were magnificent and thÂ«
music of thÂ«Â» most pleasing kind.

VICTORIA. B. C, July 22.â The steamer
Amur, the richest treasure ship of the
season, bringing, a million in gold dust an<l
ninety passengers, most of whom have
made fortunes in the Klondike either
mining or trading, reached here this
afternoon. Besides the gold there wera
of course many drafts representing an
other million in dust which the passengers
had disposed of before leaving Dawson.
Among the richest men on board were
Robert Anderson, who located the Gov
ernment concession on Hunker Creek in
which a number of Vancouverites are in
terester and out of a pocket la which
$90,GX> was taken; Hart, the owner of Dis
covery of Bonanza; Mrs. Nellson, who has
made $100,000 out of the Yukon Hotel,
Dawson. and who ls on her way to
Sweden: H. I.IcLaughlin, a Bonanza claim
owner; C. Leplant, who owns discovery ol
Last Chance; Turner Tawnsend, who has
Just disposed of a ton of tobacco and
cig-ars in Dawson. and Mrs. Shute, wife
of the senior partner in Suuto & Mills,
who took $<90,000 out of four claims on
Gold Run, and the Cassidy Brothers, who
have just sold one claim on French Hill
for an immense suon.
These men estimate the year's output of
Klondike at twenty-five millions, taking
Into account the fact that the claims are
now being worked summer and winter.
There is still a great deal of grumbling
over the 10 per cent royalty which the
miners .say makes it Impossible to work
some of the richest- claims at a profit.

Whom Have Made Hand

rRAP AND LIVE BIRD
SHOOT AT 1NGLESIDE
The Dudes were very bad actors on their
own diamond yesterday morning. Eight
reeking errors and poor hitting made the
second game of the series an easy victory
for the Millers.
Stockton started the game with a cou
ple of runs and kept up the pace to the
linish. Borchers twirled for the Dudes
and he was not unsolvable for the swat
ters from Stockton, who rolled out ten
hits during the game. The errors of the
Dudes made the play so ragged that even
the Oakland contingent went away in su
preme disgust, muttering exercations at
their own team.
The Dudes tried behind the bat a new
man. Clark, who gave way to Hardie in
the first part of the game. Whalen pitch
ed a gooa game, the six hits made off his
delivery being scattered. The score:

club In theBota de Boulogne. The weather
was c-joler lhaji it was last wwk, though

ninth places, totalling 26. Thus England
won. Her two long distance runners. Hen
nett arid Kimmer, led from the outside.
Time, lo minutes ana 23 1-8 seconds.
The proceeding concluded with a dis
tribution of the priaws won to-day.
It is not often that so many riflemen
assemble on the Shell Mound range as
gathered thero yesterday. The number
of militiamen was much larger than usual.
Despite the fact that many of the local
target shots are out after the fleet-footed
dear the target branch of the sport was
well represented. These marksmen are
losing no opportunity for practice in prep
aration for the big National Schuetzen
bund tournament of next year. Captain
L. Slebe is also getting ready for that
event. Last Friday* he signed the con
tract with the local members of the bund
and set to work at once to put the range
in order. Partitions dividing the shooting
stands have been pulled out, tables and
gun racks constructed and targets being
put in order. This i3 only the preliminary
work. The big shooting shed will have
to be enlarged and everything generally
overhauled. Even with twelve months in
which to make preparations there is no
time to lose.
The wind and light conditions yesterday
were not of the best, although the day
was pleasant. Possibly this may account
for some of the .very poor scores made by
some of the military shots on the 300 and
500 yard ranges. In Justice to the rifle
men it must be said that long-range' prac
tice has been sadly neglected for several
years and when it comes to shooting in a
strong, uneven wind the marksmen were
at sea in the matter of shifting their
windgauges. Those shooting on the long
ranges competed for records, trophies and
honors bestowed by the State. In fact, it
was their first State shoot for 1U00. An
nexed are the scores made in five-shot
runs on the Blunt military target:

The running was far from being easy
for the favorites in the finals of the open
stake yesterday at Union Coursing Park,
and many, of the well-liked hounds, were
put out of the game in goes where the
talent reckoned it a shame to take the
money. From start to finish the coursing
was of the hard variety, which makes the
naming of the winner an uncertainty un
til the last point is scored. "
The first course on the card was be
tween Hawker and Maud S and was voted
easy pickings for Curtis & Sons 1 fust one.
Hawker had few followers who would risk
a chance on him even with the tempting
odds of 7 to 1 apainst him.
It was a pretty race, the dogs running
neck and neck from the slips to the game.
Hawker when near the hare drove out tor
the turn, got the kill and beat Maud S
pointless.
Hawker's plory was short lived, how
ever. In the third round he was beaten by
Twin City Girl, who though winning , tne
hardest kind of a course from Wait a Bit
in the previous round, plainly showed thai
Hawker was not in her class.
Lily of the West made a merited win
from May Mempstead, the talent's choice,
but in the next round failed to score a
point against Royal Flush.
Rural Artist showed all kinds of speed,
but was handicapped by severe work. In
his first go he beat Belle Claire pointless,
scoring 14 to hi3 credit. Belle showed in
great form on Saturday, but against the
Pasha Kennel's entry there was nothing
to it. Against St. Michael in the third
round the Artist got the flag in a heart
breaking course that settled his cbaiicc
In the stake. He piled up 22 points, IS of
which were made before his opponent tal
lied.
Mayflower made a clean score against
Tea Rose and kept up the winning gait
until she landed the stake from Royal
Flush. Nothing could stop her.
Rosie Claire went out to her without
scoring, and Controller had his measure
taken after an undecided. The talent
fancied Sir Pasha in the next round and
made him a 4 to 1 favorite, but Mayflower
was there at the finish with a 7-3 score.
In the final Royal Flush ran a poor sec
ond, Mayflower getting the decision after
a long course in which she led and out
worked McComb's popular black one,
scoring 14 to his 5. Flush was a 5 to 2
favorite. Royal Union did excellent work
in the stake, beating Rest Assured. For
Glory and Miss Penman. He finally went
out to Crawford Bn*;s in the fifth round
after an undecided. In this go Union got
a bad fall and before he\ could Join In
again Braes got the flag, but was with
drawn in the next round on account of
the severe work.

prounds into a snappy, close and exciting
match, necessitating two extra innings
before a decision could be reached. In
the second inning- Moskiman was found
lÂ»y tbe Millers for a bunch of hits which,
conjoined with fulsome errors, pave
Stockton a heavy lead of four runs. After
this Moskiman settled, pitching stronger
and stronger ball as the game progressed.
Harper, who was on the slab for the Mill
ers, weakened at last and the Dudes took
their only victory of the series.
It was In the eighth inning that the
Dudes reached a baseball measure and
tied the score. For the next three innlnga
the game was as clean cut as a diamond.
Oakland played two tyros, Bowman and
Fonl, neither of whom displayed ajiy
signs of extraordinary ability with the
sttck or in their respective positions, but
they are the kind that develop well.
Stockton bexan swatting in the -.second
InninK and before the Millers were sent
to the field Moskiman was punched three
times and four men were sent over the
plate. Loekhe.nd Jopged to nrst, reaching
the middle bafc on Babbitt's hit to Arrel
lanes and advancing a base on Moore's
hit to Francks, who forced Babbitt out
at second. lx>ckhoad scored on Harper's
lift and Moore on Pyne's. Then came a
lilt by MoGucken, Pyne and Harper cross
ing the plate. This was all that happened
in the way of runs during the inning.
The third brought a run for the Dudes.
Held took Ilrst on a hit. stole second and
on Lockhead's error of Bowman's hit
went to third, scoring on a bunt by Borch
ers.
Stockton nut another stroke on the score
In the fifth. McCarthy earned the first
bag 1 , went to second on McGucken's out
and third on Pace's hit. scoring on a wild
throw of Ford to Lange.
In the sixth Oakland brought the score
up to 3 to 5. Ford took the ball on the
llo:itinj? ribs, going to second on Moore's
error of Franck's hit. A pretty single to
center by Mosklman scored Ford and sent
Francks to third. Then Arrellants hit to
Lockhead; who caught Moskiman going
to second, and doubled Arrellanes at tirst,
but Francks scored on the play. Held
flew out.
The eighth was the Inning for the Dudes
and bv it they ti<d the score. Lango
drove a nice one over to second and was
safo at the first bag. Two pretty steals
landed him on third. Held fanned the air
throe times and went out, but
I-nnge scored on the play. A hit by Ar
rellanes scored Francks, and when Ar
rellanes fell to grabbing the bags on
Moore's bad throw of Held's hit to Stretb
it looked for a moment as if Oakland
would add the winning run. But Arrel-
Iane3 was too gay and perished at the
plate.
In the ninth Stockton went out In one.
two, three order. Then came Oakland's
turn. Bowman reached first on Lock
head's error and second on Borchers' sac
rifice. Borchers deliberately sent Drennan
to first on balls for the j>ossible chance of
a double play, but the double never came.
Lange then rolled out the ball to right,
making second, but Bowman died at the
plate on the throw in. Ford's out put
an extra inning to the jrajne.
The tenth opened with Pace up. He
died, Arrellanes and Borchers in the play.
Streib th^n flew to Drennan. Lockhead
couldn't see the ball and Stockton went
to the field. Francks 6tarted for the
Dudes but nothing came of it but death,
McCarthy in left field being responsible.
Mnsktman retired on a foul fly to Moore
and Arrellanes then picked his tombstone
in left field.
The eleventh began with Babbitt s death
and Moore was also put under earth.
Pyne flew to Bowman, and it was Oak

THE SAJV FRANCISCO CALL, MOJSJDAr, JVL,Y 23, 1UOO.
taken by the Board of Trustees to-mor
row night on an ordinance submitted by
Mayor Clark providing lor tne licensing
of nickel-in-ihe-flot machines. The Major
says he is moved to Uils course by the
stories which had gained circulation that
a corruption fund was being raised each
nunth among machine owners and rent
ers for the purpose of securing freedom
from official interference. He says that
when he took office List February he notl
tiod the machine owners and renters that
they need not raise any more money.
Since that time there have been no ar
resta and no police Interference,- Chief Sul
livan explaining this circumstance by tho
etatcmeui ttiat It is impossible to secure
juries to convict and further that Mayor
tMurk had informed him that he had a
license ordinance In preparation. On the
other hand, tho fnro dealers and others
whose games were closed down on Mayor
Chirks Order are asking why it Is that
the machines, which are equally subject
to the Sttite law. should have been allowed
to run unmolested.
It is probable that the Board of Trustees
will decline to-morrow nieht to pass the

SACRAMENTO'S GAIN.
I
Assessment Boll Is Much Higher
Than That of Last Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. July 22.-Conslderable
satisfaction is gained by the citizens at
Sacramento from the fact that the county
assessment roll shows that the county of
Sacramento to-day is a full $1,500,000
higher than it was a year ago. The in
teresting feature of this statement is that
the roll is one upon which, every dollar
may be collected and Is. not even in the
remotest particular inflated. The assess
ment roll foots up in round numbers $33 -
000,000. An increase in the city of Sacra
mento is noticed of 5300,000 in personal
property alone, due principally to the In
creased valuation of the business of the
big firms and corporations.
County Assessor Berkey figures that
the gain will result in a decrease of the
tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 valuation
from last year's tax. This should give a
State and county tax rate for property
within the city limits of $1 40 on the $100
and for property In the county outside the
city limits of SI 50 on the $100. The delin
quent tax list this year was so small aa
scarcely to justify the newspaper . charge
for advertising- it, and these evidences of
prosperity are matters for general con
gratulation here.

ginning of his Incumbency rendered it Im
possible for him to play the pacific part
which he later undertook, and he finally
fled in all haste to secure his own safety
from the territory which he was incom
petent to govern.
Geary of Pennsylvania followed In Sep
tember, 1S5G. He had been chosen no Ies3
for his great executive gifts than for his
Democratic sympathies.
The presidential campaign was at Its
height when Governor Geary reached
Kansas, and" he saw that Kansas must be
pacified with all speed or the Democratic
party was doomed. He declared to the
Missouriana that one more of their raids
would defeat Buchanan. So determined
and so skillful were the governor's meas
ures that a short lived Quiet did settle
over the territory in course of a few
weeks, and had Geary been honestly sup
ported by the federal administration lie
would no doubt have succeeded In estab
lishing Justice and order In Kansas. But
he too. soon leaned too plainly toward
Che free state party and. losing favor at
Washington, he was forced to resign.
Robert J. Walker of Mississippi was
the fourth Governor of Kansas. By tha
time of his appointment, in the spring of
1S57, the hope of making Kansas a slave
StatÂ« had been abandoned as futile, and
all administration energies were to be
concentrated upon the effort to make a
Democratic state. It was for this pur
pose that a man eminent and Â«perlenct'<l
In party tactics was chosen for a position
so inierlor. Governor Walker proved an
exceli-nt official, winning the confidence
of th& free state settlers and inducing
them to take part for the first time. In
October. 1S57, in the election for the terri
torial legislature. But the high handed
proceeding of the pro-slavery party n
respect to the Lecompton constitution
drove Governor Walker also Into ;he
ranks of their opponents. He could not

Inventor Amos Wyckoff
Nears Death in Exhibit
ing Patent Fabric.
?
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, July 22.
Amos Wyckcff, the inventor of patent
fireproof garments, was nearly burned to
death this afternoon at Oakland Park
while giving an exhibition of. his non
combustible clothing.
The unfortunate exhibitor was so badly
scorched by the flames in which he riad
been trying to demonstrate good points
in his invention that medical attention
was necessary, and there is danger that
his injuries may prove fatal. Despite the
conditions surrounding the accident,
Wyckoff did not blame the severe burn-
Ing upon the failure of his patent to work.
In fact, he declared that had he not been
protected with the fireproof fabric he
would surely have suffered a horrible
death.
The burning was caused, he said, by the
tearing of a portion of the suit while he
was plunping through a mass of flaming
brush soaked with coal oil. The trousers
caught on a splintered tree branch and
ripped lust as he was in the center of the
fire, and before he could free himself from
the tangle of trousers and twigs the fire
had run into his underparments and they
started to burn. The fireproof outer suit
smothered the spreading flames, WyckofT
paid, while hÂ© was drag-gin? himself out
of the blaze. Dr. Reinhart was called and
gave the suffering Inventor attention, al
leviating the intense pain.
The Injured inventor was removed to
his home and will be under a doctor's
care for some time. His legs and hands
were severely burned. __

arrived In September, 1555, and put himself
at once with intemperate zeal upon the
side of the lawless, pro-slavery- faction.
The territorial government and the State
government under the Topeka constitu
tion were now contending for recognition,
and the logic of events wrought a consid
erable change In Governor Shannon's
ignoble trick, orginaiing. we are told, in,
tne high circles of the Washington, admin
istration, called upon the people to vote
only upon what were called the slavery
clauses of the constitution. The Question
was "the constitution with slavery or tha
constitution with no slavery." But by
clauses not submitted to vote "the consti
tution with no slavery" still made slavery
perpetual so far as concerned the slaves
already in the territory and their off
spring. The free state men. as a matter
of course, refused to vote, but the new
legislature, which they controlled, sub
mitted the whole constitution to the peo
ple In January. 1S53. and it was voted
down by an enormous majority. The slave
state party had In their turn declined to
vote, but an honest ballot had been taken
ar.d a comparison of the figures with thosa
of previous elections showed that Kansas
voters were at least two to one against
slavery. News of the Lecomptoa consti
tution swindle revived the declining inter
est of the country In the fortunes of Kan
sas. Appeal had been made to congress
for the admission of the territory to
statehood under the Lecompton constitu
tion and the Democratic party was soon
In a violent wrangle over the vexlr.g ques
tion. Douglaj and many other Northern
Democrats and party newspapers protest
ed against the measure, to which th*
President adhered tenaciously. The elec
tion of January, which showed beyond
question the real wishes of the Kansas
settlers, effected nothing- with the admin
istration. Every resource of official pat
ronage was brought to bear to advance
the cause of slavery. The bill passed the
Senate, but hung fire in the House, and
finally failed to pass. Disgraceful scenes
occurred during the heated congressional
debate. The bitterest and most scorching
words were not enough, many of the
members became engaged in .ctuai
fist fights and only because more
dangerous weapons happened not to be at
hand was there no bloodshed or serious
bodily injury. The wounded feelings were
not soon healed.
The Dred Scott Decision.
The whole subject of slavery In the
federal domain came before the country
In a new phase, while the statu3 cf Kan
sas was still unsettled. The Dred Scott
decision of the Supreme Court will be con
sidered more fully hereafter for Us Im
portant bearing upon party history. It ia
mentioned here only to show its connec
tion with the original subject of dispute
In Kansas.
Dred Scott, a negro slave, had sued for
his freedom several yeara before on the
ground that he had been taken by his
master to the free state of Illinois and to
the free territory of the northern portion
of the Louisiana purchase, where, accord
ing to the Missouri compromise, slavery
could not exist. In due course the case
came before the highest court of the na
tion, and two days after the Inauguration
of President Buchanan the decision waa
rendered. The negTO was returned to sla
very since no negro of slave ancestry
could stand before a court of the United
States as a "citizen" competent to sue or
be sued. The court then went on to dis
cuss the other chief constitutional point3
involved, and the decision pronounced the
Missouri compromise act "not warranted
by the constitution and therefore void."
This absolutely knocked all foundation
from the doctrine of popular sovereignty
under which thÂ« long struggle for Kansas
had been carried on. for since congTes3
had no power to forbid slavery in a terri
tory It certainly could not create a territo
rial legislature which should possess that
power. No territory, then, could under
any possible circumstances bar out sla
very, and the doctrine of popular sover
eignty worked only one wayâ to permit
the citizens of a federal territory to vote
the Institution up. never down. Only a
sovereign state could. establish freedom.
Kansas a State.
In 1S53 the Kansas Legislature onee
more called a constitutional convention,
which met at Leavenworth. The free
state party was now supreme and the con
stitution adopted prohibited slavery. It
was ratified by the people and sent to
"Washington. But once more the pro-sla
very Senate refused the appeal, this time
on the alleged ground that the population
of the territory was Insufficient. The fol
lowing year still another convention
adopted the Wyandotte constitution.
which also prohibited slavery. This was
ratified by the people, sent to congress,
and Kansas was at last, after years of
waiting and repeated refusals, admitted
as a state. But It was not until after the
"Union had been dismembered and the
Senators from the seceded states had
withdrawn that the opposition of the up
per chamber was overcome.

Indications are strong that the fruit can
ners' combine is hard pressed for apricots.
Agents of the trust have been making ex
traordinary efforts In Alameda County
fruit growing centers to secure 'cots, of
fering from $20 to $25 a ton. That figure
was made for apricots delivered at the
cars at Niles.
The canneries' representatives have
gone among the growers with all sorts of
propositions to start the movement. In
one case at Niles a buyer offered a second
man his own figure as commission if he
would get special crops for J25 a ton. The
situation shows, however, that the com
bine will not raise Its schedule, but will
pay liberal commissions to those who suc
ceed jn turning fruit its way.
From the Niles district, where a superior
quality of 'cots is raised, cannery buyers
report that they would handle double the
quantity of fruit that Is being offered if
they could induce growers to sell rather
than to dry their yield. There Is every
indication that a great amount of fruit
will be dried in order to maintain prices.
These conditions, while not altogether
one-sided for the growers, are the direct
result of the refusal of the canneries to
establish better prices for the fresh fruit
required for packing.
While the orchardists were unable to or
ganize a strong association to fight the
j combine, so many fruit men have declined
to part with their crops at cannery figures
| that they seem to have the upper hand of
the market. It is claimed by the can
neries' agents that the 'cot yield of the
State will be 9Q.(W0 tons and that they can
handle only 30.Â«>0 tons. Of course, the In
ference intended Is that the prices cannot
be maintained and that growers are In no
position to dictate terms. But so far as
many of the large orchardists are con
cerned the figures do not appear to worry
them. E. A. Ellsworth, one of the lead
ing growers of the Niles district. Is quoted
as placing no stock In that position. He
says the canneries have offered him his
own terms to recure 'cots for them, and
I that he has declined the tenders.

TRUCKEE, July 22.â Water seems to
follow in the wake of the San Francisco
city officials, who are here investigating
Lake Tahoe. It rained in this vicinity
last night and to-day, and the mathema
ticians of the party have tigured out that
it added 132,475,o31 gallons of water to the.
lake, with a. few precincts yet to hear
from. AH agree that there is but one Lake
Tahoe, and it ia ideai for ownership by
the metropolis.
Chairman Reed is especially enthusias
tic over the prospects and is not greatly
worried over the .protest of the Renoites.
whose "You caii't play in our lake" is not
regarded seriously, iteed says it is of
secondary consiUcration ana capable of
legal adjustment. There is plenty of
water for botli States, says Reed, and
California, certainty uem nguis as well u-a

panies the party in the nature of medical
adviser ar.a h&s eschewed solvent credits
lor thÂ« nonce, sees in tne use of Lake
Tahoe water a. eenslbie diminution of dis
ease resulting from drinking impure water
by the people ot tian Francisco. He says
the four years or" practical drougnt
through which California has passed nas
been an enormous drain on the resources
of the Spring Vailey Water Company. An
other ytar of arought, says Dodge, and
San Francisco will tie luce to face witn a
water famine, and it is not at all improb
able that tha use of water next auiuinn
will have to be curtailed.
Oakland's Opportunity.
Councilman Taylor of Oakland, which
has troubles of its own in the water line,
believes that now is the time for Oakland
to co-operate with its metropolitan ne'gh
bor in procuring an adequate pure water
supply. He is fortifying himself with
fstcis, tierures and samples of Tahoe water,
which he intenas to lay before his col
leagues in an endeavor to bring them to
his way of thinking that the water is the
"goods " and ought to be delivered to tha
two bay clues.

tract as piping water from Lake Tahoe
to San Francisco. Chairman Jennings
cf the Finance Committee says he is fuily
prepared to direct the nnanceerlng of the
necessary funds raised by bond issue.
Dentist Boxton does not think so much of
the water, as its purity has an improv
ing effect on the teeth. Connor, Curtis
and Dwyer say water is only good to
bathe in and to wash rubber boots, but
agree thut the Tahoe article is a superior
brand. McCarthy would rather talk
about the Health Board, while Helms is
non-committal.
Colonel James H. O'Brien, who Is of
seme consequence in San Francisco polit
ical circles, was yesterday "discovered"'
at Tallac. He will Join the Supervisorial
Commission in an inspection of the Yuba
River water sheds. He will give the bene
fit of experience in liquids other than
water covering a period of many years.
O'Brien is rather skeptical about the pos
sibility of Sail Francisco acquiring its own
water system and does not hestltate to
express it He quotes Gladstone, who
once, in reference to Ireland acquiring
home rule, said:
"There may be a day. maybe not in my
time."
Programme of Commissioners.
Unfavorable weather to-day prevented
any- further extended investigation of
Lake Tahoe. The party was regaled with
interesting reminiscences by Charley Ol
son, on? of the oldest Inhabitants here
abouts, who was with Von Schmidt when
the latter built his famous dam in 1S65.
Olson was found slttinc In his front win
dow, where It is said he pinches himself
every now and then to dispel visions of
"what might have been had things been
different." Â»;
Th*re is work ahead for the commission
In the next three days. A start will be
made from Truckee to-morrow morning
In carriages, which will convey the mem
bers across the ir.atn rid** of the Sierras
to inspect the water sheds of the Yuba
and American rivers. They will be piloted
Ijv \V. K. Englebright and Hugh Masruire
of the Marvsvllle and Nevada Power
Compnnv. which has made an offer of sup
ply to San Francisco. The Investigation
will hp thorough and will consume at
least three days.
All Are Satisfied So Far That a
Good Supply of Pure Water
Can Be Obtained From
Lake Tahoe.
Inclement Weather Keeps
the Party Indoors at
Truckee.

The Federal Governors.
It was In the territory of Kansas that
the sectional question of slavery or no
slavery formed the absolute line of divi
sion between the two parties. Until that
question was determined no other matters i
could receive attention, The territorial
governors appointed by the Democratic
pro-slavery administrations at Washing
ton were of course pro-slavery Democrats, |
sent out. every man cf them, to serve the
Southern cause. But the fact that once
upon the ground and- the situation gra-Â«ped
these same "ro-slavcrv Democratsâ almost
without exceptionâ were won to the free
State side of the quarrel speaks loudly for
the justice of that side.
Andrew H. Reeder of Pennsylvania en
tered upon his official duties In October,
1S54. He was an enthusiastic Democrat of I
the Douglas school, a lawyer of reputa
tion and an honorable man. He honestly '
desired to quiet the turbulent spirit al- j
ready manifest on the border and to |
deal fairly with all. Having traveled over i
his domain, he ordered an election for i

himself too much after the manner of hiÂ»
official chief and effectually aiding 'ho
free state cause.
General Denver of Vlrsrlnia. who came
next upon the roll, announced hi* inten
tion to carry out the policy of hi3 prede
cessor. He accepted tne appointment un
willingly, determined to resign as soon aj
possible, which h" did in October. l.vW Ha
had striven Ineffectually for fair dealing
and political Justice. Of all the territorial
governors hitherto he was the only one
whose resignation was wholly voluntary.
To him succeeded Governor iledary of
Ohio, whose administration fell in more
peaceful times.
The LÂ«coiapton Constitution.
One of the promises by Â¦which Governor
"Walker induced the anti-slavery settlers
to share in the October election of 1SC7
was that the Lecornpton constitution
should be submitted to popular vote. The
pro-Â«lavery legislature which was Just
retiring had called a constitutional con
vention, which was stMl In session at L*
corr.pton, and did not adopt a constitution
until November 7. The October election
meantime returned a free state legisla

REV I \THER HEVERIN of Oakland, recently ordained, preached h!s mald

AT THE THEATERS
LAST night "Rush City" was pre
sented by Mathews & Bulger and
tho all-star cast of Dunne & Ryley
at the California Theater. "Rush
City" affords several admirable opportu
nities to the all-star cast. One well taken
by Miss Whalley Is to look pretty and
wear some most fetching gowns, also to
â¢demonstrate the truth of her own state
ment that It really doesn't matter whether
one can or cannot act, don't you know, if
one looks beautiful while one is making
believe to. Mary Marble, the quaint and
dainty, also takes her opportunity in
some cute songs, which are well enjoyed.
Mathews & Bulger have a chance in a
famous old specialty and are loudly ap
plauded for the same. Bessie Tannehill,
Ry!ey and Hart and the Mascottes also
while away a pleasant moment. As for
"Rush City" itself, it Is without rhyme or
reason, plot or plan, a kaleidoscopic ar
rangement in cyclones, steam cars, sex
tets and the rest of H. But It serves to
amuse, which Is a sufficient raisin d'etre.
There Is an excellent bill at the Or
pheum this week.- A notable engagement
Is that of Miss Jessie Padgham, a new
Californian songstress from Los Angeles.
Broke Into the Oberon.
George Williams, an ex-employe In the
Oberon, on O'Farrell street, which is tem
porarily closed, forced an entrance
through the basement yesterday morning
and broke open two nickel-ln-the-slot ma
.chines in the expectation of getting some
money. He was discovered by Carl A.
; Thilo, one of the proprietors, and held till
the patrol wagon arrived with Policeman
Morris. Williams was taken to the City
Prison, where a charge of burglary was
booked against him.
Martin Connor Viciously Attacked
Without App-rent Cause by His
Cousin's Husband.
Martin Connor, coal and wood dealer,
27S Tenth street, called upon James Irwln,
carpenter. 3C10 Sixteenth street, yesterday
afternoon with his nephew. Mrs. Irwln Is
Connor's cousin and the nephew wanted
to see her before he went East,
Connor rang the bell and Irwln opened
the front door. "Hello, Martin," he said,
and without another word attacked Con
nor with a pocket knife, stabbing him on
the riKht arm above the elbow, severing
the deltoid muscle, and cutting him three
times on the left wrist and hand. Then
he closed the door In Connor's face. Con
nor was led to a nearby drug store by
his nephew and the patrol wagon was
summoned from the Seventeenth-street
Police Station. It took the wounded man
to the Receiving Hospital and Dr. Alex
ander stitched and dressed his wounds.
It will be some time before he Is able to
use his right arm again.
Irwln was arrested by Policeman Shee
han and booked on the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. Sheehan and De
tective Fitzgerald went back to the house
to search for the knife and found it se
creted in a drawer. It was held as evi
dence. Irwtn was sent to the Xapa In
sane Asylum some time ago, but was dis
charged as cured. Recently he has been
acting queerly again.

of climate might better his condition.
The doctor is nearly 70 years of age.
Two years ago he was stricken with apo
plexy, but partially recovered. The stroke
Friday night left the doctor's body partly
paralyzed and his voice is almost gone.
The fine weather and the presence of bo
many troops in carr.p attracted a large
crowd to the Presidio yesterday. From
g-uard mount, at 9:30 a. m., until late in
the afternoon visitors arrived, some at

friends among the troops ordered away.
The latter wr-re largely in the majority.
It seemed almost a repetition of the scenes
of two year? ago, when the sole delight of
Kan Francieranp scorned to be the payinp
of lavish attention to the soldier boy. The
overage wearer of the blue who spends a

the pun shines, and requires more time for
his farewells than those who have resided
here as many years. Many a fond fare
â¢wrll was F.iid yesterday.
Every battery of the Third Artillery sta
tioned In California, with the exception of
Battery D of San Diego, which is expected

Her success was immediate and assured.
Her voice is a clear, round soprano, of
good compass, admirably trained and
used with remarkable effort by one so
new to the platform. Miss Padgham
made her first appearance last week at
the Los Angeles Orpheum and Is now
regularly engaged in vaudeville work. It
Is safe to prophecy, though, that this
charming ballad singer will soon decide
her metier to be other than the variety
stage, and yet another will be added to
the long list of Californlan contributions
to the vocal great ones of the earth.
Another success of the evening was the
Joe Sullivan and Carrie Webber combina
tion In the farcette "The Janitor." Mr.
Sullivan's face is certainly his fortune
but some of us would rather be poor. It's
a wonderful make-up. Mazie King's
dance on her tip-tippy toes is a wonderful
performance, and deserved even more
than the generous recognition accorded
it. Miss Burkhartâ always a favoriteâ in
a new play. Williamson and Stone and
the Xieker-Baker Trio wero warmly wel
comed. The return engagement of our
clever Etta Butler is also a big success.
The fifth week of the Henry Miller sea
son at the Columbia Theater wfll begin
to-night- with "His Excellency the Gov
ernor," a farcical romance by R. Mar
shall. It will be presented, for the first
time .In San Francisco this evening, and
to judge by the reputation which has pre
ceded it from London and New York
should prove to be fully as successful as
the rest of the brilliant reportoire which
Mr. Miller and his clever company have
so far exhibited. The cast In "His Ex
cellency the Governor" will Include al
most all the members of the company.
Burton Holmes of Chicago pleased a
large audience last evening at the Colum
bia Theater with his illustrated lecture on
Manila. His carefully chosen pictures. In
teresting personal anecdotes, beautiful
English and particularly his dissertation
on late Philippine history were delightful.
The lecture was patriotic, Instructive and
thoroughly enjoyable.
The new Frawleys will begin their sec
ond week of "The Great Ruby" at the
Grand Opera-house this evening. This
perfectly staged and excellently acted
melodrama is crowding the house every
night and will be continued until, further
notice.
This week sees the close of one of the
most successful seasons of comic opera
that even the popular Tlvoli has ever
seen. "Wang" will retain, the stage until
next week, and the revival' of this favor
ite musical farce is a most popular one.
Next week the Tlvoll â¢ Opera-house will
celebrate its coming of age, with the be
ginning of one of the most'notable sea
sons of grand opera that has ever been
given in this city. Salassa, Avedano, Rus
so, NIcolIni. Ferrari, Repetto, LIchter,
Stewart, are names to charm, and theso
are not all. Many old favorites will be
heard, William Schuster, Quinto Zani,
Frances Graham, Lia Pollettini and the
excellent chorus and orchestra Insure, a
rarely worthy performance in the domain
of grand opera.

The Alcazar will present this week "The
Country Girl," the quaint old comedy of
manners by William "Wycherley. written
in the year of our Lord 1672, at the town
of London. Florence Roberts, who will
appear In the name role, has secured the
edition revised by Daly for the use of Ada

"The Country Girl" was first produced
in this country in 1789 at the John-street

coin's Inn Fields, with the King's com
pany. For many years It remained a fav
orite among the English players and all
the famous actresses at one or another
time played the "Mrs. Plnchwlfe" role,
now known as Peggy. But with the
changing fashion of the times, the dain
tier moral stomachs of the seventeenth
century, the coarseness of "The Country
Wife" became more and more offensive
and for many years the comedy lay un
used. Even as early at 1709 in the Tattler,
Richard Steele, by no means squeamish,
excuses the conception of the hero,
Horner. by saying that "Mr. Wycherley
had at that time (1G73) only discovered his
want of knowing the manners of tho
court he lived In, by a virtuous character
in his fine gentleman, as he would show
his Ignorance by drawing a vicious one to
please the present audience."
Then Garrlck. in 17t>6. at that time In
the full zenith of his power?, revived the
play, but expurgated and rechrlstened It,
and very considerably changed the un
pleasant plot. "The Country Girl" has
not been played for a long twenty years
In San Franciscoâ not since the palmy
days of the old Bush-street Theater, and
may not be played for a long twenty
years more. Therefore we shall flock
early to the Alcazar this evening to wish
good luck to the courageous little com

No Hint of Relationship.
The fact that Mrs. Townsend had a
daughter, that her name is Mrs. Ella F.
Murray and that she happened to be In
town at the time of the death of the es
timable lady was a great surprise to those
who knew Mrs. Townsend intimately.
Some of these friends had met Mrs. Mur
ray on her previous visits to this city and
had been introduced to her by Mrs.
Townsend, but the lady whom Mrs. Mur
ray claims was her mother Introduced
her as plain Mrs. Murray and never made
any allusion to any relationship what
ever that might have existed between
them.
Mrs. Murray came here from her home
in Dorchester early in June, and on the
13th of that month secured apartments
at the Palace Hotel. Early yesterday
morning Miss Rattigan appeared at the
hotel and was shown to Mrs. Murray's
room.
near relativesâ but that also. I am sorry
to say, I must decline to discuss. My full
name is Mrs. Ella F. Murray and my
home Is In Dorchester, Mass. My mother
was never married to any other man than
Townsend. I was never known by the
name, which was rightly mine, of Town
send, but that Is also another of those
forbidden questions.
"This is my third visit to San Francisco.
When or why I came this time, how long
I have been here and where I have made
my home since my stay here I must de
cline to answer. My mother was born in
Lowell, Mass., on the 17th of June, 1831.
She came to California In 1S59."
It was at this point where it was ap
parent that the Interviewer had exhaust
ed all questions, Â£hat Miss Rattigan
begged leave to tell of Mrs. Townsend's
last act of kindness.
"She had ordered." said Miss Rattlgan.
"two handsome banners, the finest ever
manufactured in this State, and they vrere
to have been publicly presented to the
Native Sons on the occasion of the com
ing 9th of September celebration. One of
"I want you to come with me," she said,
"to Mrs. Townsend's house. Something
has happened to her."
"Who are you?" said Mrs. Murray. "I
don't know you and I will not go with
you unless you get some one to identify
you."
After some little delay Miss Rattlgan
was properly identified and succeeded in
convincing Mrs. Murray that it was quite
safe to trust herself to her charge.
"Well, get a doctor," said Mrs. Murray,
"and I'll go with you." Dr. Helntz was
pressed into service and the ladies, ac
companied by the physician. Jumped in a
hack and were driven to the Townsend
home. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock
Mrs. Murray surrendered her apartment
at the Palace and installed herself in the
late home of the woman shÂ« claims as
mother. How Miss Rattlgan knew of
Mrs. Murray, while Mrs. Murray was al
together ignorant of Miss Itattigan, is
another of the mysterious issues of the
affair.

GUARDING THE REMAINS.
r m Â¦% HE sudden death of Mrs. A.
H S. Townsend, announced ex
clusively in The Call yester
day morning 1 , has developed an after
math of deep mystery. A daughter
of Â¦whom no one had ever heard has
appeared s-ddenly and mysterious
ly upon the scene, assumed charge of
all the details of the funeral, taken
possession of the To\rasend home on
California street and denied admis
sion to intimate friends of the lady
she claims was her mother.

years Mrs. Townsend's confidential friend,
ere probably the only ones who know of
the last moments of the dead lady. Mrs.
Murray refuses politely yet very firmly
to discuss the m:mer and Miss Rattigan
Is under Mrs. Murray's surveillance, and
that lady declares all questions must be
addressed to her.
The alleged daughter of the dead phi
lanthropist is a woman who has probably
rf-aohfd the hrilf-rentury mark, and in her
round and ruddy fs^e no resemblance can
be traced to the woman she claims was
her mother. She moved about the Cali

â¢woman who was laboring under a great
nervous tension.
Every muscle appeared strained; her
Â«>yes had a strange, glittering light in
thpm and they seemed to be watching
every move and expression of those she
came in contact with. Her voice, how
ever, was calm and even and under per
fect control and when she refused to an
5Wf r a question it was with a courtesy
that was marked and extreme. Miss Rat
tipa.n was summoned to introduce Mrs.
Murray as the daughter of Mrs. Townsend.
This she did in a most formal manner,
but the confidential friend took scarcely
any part in the conversation. She sat with
downcast eyes and when she volunteered
any information Mrs. Murray was first
appealed to for penniFsnon to speak,

officer and a fireman were detailed to
guard the house. The police first secured
all the doors and windows to keep out in
vaders. The fireman took up his post Im
mediately inside the front door and the
officer stood on the outside. Each person
who applied for admittance was required
to give his name to the policeman and he
in his turn presented It to Mrs. Murray.
If the party was objectionable the an
swer was given that no one was allowed
inside the house and thÂ« officer commu
nicated this decision to the person in
waiting. Some few were admitted, but
most who visited the house were obliged
to return to their homes without having
passed the threshold of the now gloomy
mansion. .
The fireman detailed on the premises
seemed more to serve In the capacity of
a lackey than in that of a fire flKhter. He
simply opened the front door and closed
it again when anyone passed in or out.
Xo instructions were given him that
would lead him to believe he was there
to protect the premises from fire.

Result of the Autopsy.
Yesterday afternoon Dr. T. B. W. In
land held an autopsy on the body of Mrs.
Townsend and found that death was due
to hypertrophy dilatation of the heart. At
the inquest it developed that Mrs. Town
send, in company with Miss Rattlgan. had
visited the Grand Opera-house on Satur
day evening:. During the performance she
complained of not feeling well, and she
and her companion retired before the play
was concluded. Miss Rattlpan returned
with Mrs. Townsend to her home and re
mained with her until midnight, when
finding that her friend was resting easier
she left for her own home, on Clay street.
Shortly after Miss Rattigan left Mrs.
Townsend's Chinese domestic was roused
by his mistress' bell. The Chinaman
found Mrs. Townsend ill and suffering,
and at her request went to summon Miss
Rattlgan. When Miss Rattigan arrived
Mrs. Townsend was not in her room. A
search revealed her lying dead on the
bathroom floor.
A prominent attorney of this city, who
has handled much of Mrs. Townsend's
business, declares that the late lady's es
tate is valued at probably JoOO.000. It con
