TWELVE PERSONES KILLED IN
NEW ORLEANS RACE RIOTS
With definite proof at hand of the baselessness of the Shanghai stories that all foreigners in Peking were massacred on
July 6-7, the hope that the envoys may still be safe has been born again and is steadily gaining strength. In a special dis
patch the Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Telegraph declares that from trustworthy information he is convinced that all
foreigner Ministers in Peking, with the exception of Baron von Ketteler, are alive. This view is borne out by a dispatch from
the Belgian Vice Consul at Tientsin, recording a persistent report that the legations are under the protection of the Chinese
Government. ;
It is^o be noted, however, that the State Department officials at Washington, who were hopeful when the rest of the
world was despondent, now reverse the situation. It is believed that messages received yesterday from Consul General Good
now tended to crystallize the growing doubt there of Mr. Conger's safety. In any case, the United States Government has re
jected Li Hung Chang's suggestion that the aliies refrain from an advance on Peking on condition that the envoys be sent to
Tientsin. In this connection it is to be noted that a reiteration of the statement that the Ministers have already left the cap
ital on their way to the coast comes from Shanghai, and one dispatch credits Li Hung Chang with saying they are due at Tien
tsin on Sunday.
As for the advance of the allies on Peking, the most definite information appears to come from Admiral Remey, who re
ports that the Chinese are hurrying reinforcements to Peking and that the commanders at Tientsin are agreed that an imme
diate advance would probably be disastrous. The date on which the admiral's dispatch was sent, however, has not been
made public, and the reported landing of 15,000 Japanese at Shanhaikwan may be of later date, in which case the allied com
manders have modified their decision. . .
Consul General Goodnow sends from Shanghai, a telegram confirming the reported massacre of missionaries at Paoting-
Fu, a station some seventy miles southwest of Peking, where a little band of eight Americans, with three children and two Eng
lishmen, remained under the protection of local authorities at the beginning of the anti-foreign rising. The extensiveness of the
anti-missionary feeling is evidenced by' other reports of rnassacresjrom such widely separated points as Shansi province and
Hainan. y >
Emperor William, in an aidress to part of the German expeditionary force which sailed for China yesterday, recom

BEB& ERLIX, July 27. â The Lokal Anzeiger says the Emperor, when addressing the troops at Bremerhaven before they
1 \jBSS\ sailed for China, referred first to the responsibilities which had sprung up for the German empire abroad during the last
' I .Jb decade. Germany's troops, he said, must now show in the face of the enemv whether their tendencies â the ten-
dencies which German military methods had followed â were right. Their comrades of the marine had already proved
1 that the training and principles upon which that arm of the force had been built up were right ones, and now it was for the troops
' to do the same.
''Every German has been filled with pride," continued his Majesty, "to learn that the highest praise bestowed upon Ger
1 man warriors has come from the mouths of- foreign leaders. The task before you is a great one. That a people like the Chinese
i should cast to the winds .international rights a thousand years old and treat with scorn the sanctity of an Embassador and the
> riglits of hospitality in a manner so horrible, is unprecedented in the history of the world. Every civilization not founded on
Christianity is sure to be brought to naught. j
"So I send vou out, Mav you all, prove vour German efficiencv, devotion and bravery, bear joyfully all discomfort and
uphold the honor and Florv of our arms. You must set an example of discipline, self-domination and self-control.
"If you close with the enemy, remember this: Spare nobody; make no
prisoners. Use your weapons so that for a thousand years hence no Chinaman
will dare look askance at any German, Open the way for civilization once

Boxers has revolted against Prince Tuan, alleging that he is making tools of them for his own ends. A desperate conflict took place out

July 27: "Four more British missionaries
have been murdered in the province of
Shansi. News from native Christian
sources say- that for eight days a general
massacre of foreigners has been in pro

Shansi. The Governor of Shantung has
wired the Consul here that he has pro

threatening native Christians with death
unless then renounce Christianity."
GENERAL MASSACRE
IN TWO PROVINCES
Eighteen missionaries have been massa
cred at Tungchau. General Sir Alfred
Gazel has started for Taku.
The Morning Post correspondent at Che
fu, wiring on Wednesday, says there Is
a rumor that Prince Chine rescued the
legations and conveyed them to a place
of safety.
The Shanghai correspondent of the Dai
ly Express asserts that three versions of
Sir Claude Macdonald's letter of July 6
are current there, and that It is believed
all three originated from Chinese sources.
He adds, however, that Li Hung Chang
says the legation party ought to reach
Tientsin on Sunday.
Thus, despite the daily alternation of
hopes and fears, the reiterated Chinese
assertions of the safety of the Ministers
fail to carry conviction and the decision
of the United States not to delay military
measures Is taken as the only possible
course to pursue. The Daily News says
that negotiations with Chinese authori
ties, If there be any in China, are useless.
It turns out that as early as July 12 an
appeal from the Empress of China to
Queen Victoria for mediation, dated July
13, was handed the Marquis of Salisbury,
and it Is understood other powers were
not communicated with until July 20.

LONDON, July 2?, 4 a. m.â Lymdn J.
Gage's statement that there Is still
hope, but that it Is constantly di

curately the Chinese situation. The
Chinese Minister In London, Sir Chih

INCLOSING WALL AND ENTRANCE OF THE PALACE OPPOSITE THE BRITISH LEGATION AT PEKING,
Discussed at Cabinet Meeting.
A special Cabinet meeting was held in
Secretary Hay's office this morning. The
Secretary of State, fresh from his per-
It is not known at present just how this
last proposition reached the State Depart
ment. It is inferred that It came from
Chinese sources, but all are believed to be
traceable to JA Hung .Chang. Mr. :Good
now, who is Consul General at Shanghai,
Is the nearest United States official to LI,
and has acquitted himself so well up to
this point that the State Department does
not hesitate to make free use of him as
a diplomatic agent. Therefore it may be
Interesting for the foreign contingent at
Shanghai, which has complained against
Mr. Goodnow's intercourse with LI Hung
Chang, to know that the Consul General
is acting In strict accordance with the in
structions of the State Department. Sec
retary Hay has cabled him to put himself
into communication with JDarl LI and ob
tain as much as possible 'that Chinese of
ficial's influence in securing the objects
plainly stated in the Identical note. It docs
not follow that the United States Is bound
to accept without question any statement
by Earl LI.
The State Department required that the
Ministers at Peking be put Into communi
cation with their Governments, and the
most significant condition of all was that
the Chinese authorities co-operate with
the relief expedition for the liberation of
the legations. Until these two things are
done the State Department absolutely re
fuses to be led into any arrangement look
ing to the mitigation of the punishment
of the Chinese Government, such as the
abandonment of the expedition to Peking.
Secretary Hay's decision to decline the
last Chinese proposition was based upon
his determination to adhere strictly to
the conditions laid down in the reply to
the Chinese Emperor's appeal.
State Department's Policy.
At no time. It is said, has the State De
partment allowed the belief that the for
eign Ministers at Peking were alive to In
terfere in the slightest degree with the
prosecution of Its military plans for reach
ing Peking. On the contrary, the news
that the Ministers were alive was accept
ed by the State Department not as con
veying absolute certainty but as an addi
tional reason for hastening the relief col
umn forward to Peking. Jt was the de
partment's contention that even though
a degree of improbability surrounded the
Chinese news as to the stata of affairs in
Peking, yet every consideration of hu
manity and policy demanded that It
should he given careful consideration and
that it should be acted upon as if true,
provided that action went to the relief of
the foreign Ministers and did not' operate
ro prevent the consummation of any of
the objects laid down in Secretary Hay's
identical note. The department Is abso
lutely satisfied that its attitude was per
fectly correct and that even European
critics will in time admit that fact.
WASHINGTON, July 27.â Secretary
Hay signalized his return to
Washington this morning by the
announcement that under no cir
cumstances would the Government accept
the Chinese offer to turn over the foreign
Ministers to the internationals at Tien
tsin in consideration of a suspension of
the campaign against Peking. A long
cablegram was dispatched to-day to Rear
Admiral Remey .-it Taku, and it is believed
that this instruction was laid upon him.
The State D^bartment claims to be pur
suing an entirely consistent course in this
decision. The officials point out that all
of the bitter criticism in the European pa
pers directed against the United States'
policy is based upon a total misunder
standing of the fundamental principles
which have governed the actions of the
department.
sonal intercourse with the President, was
in a position to advise his colleagues of
the administration's purpose and the
whole Chinese situation was discussed.
Besides Secretary Hay there were pres
ent Secretary Gage, Postmaster General
Smith and Secretary Root.
The meeting was given over to general
interchange of opinions and views. Sec
retary Itay laid before the members the
latest irVormation he had received, in
cluding a dispatch from Consul General
Goodnow at Shanghai.
The Government has received informa
tion, presumably from Admiral Remey,
that the number of allied troops, In Tien
tsin is 28,000. The movement of the troops
from Tientsin to Peking, Secretary Root
says, would depend upon the arrival and
mobilization of troops of other nations
now on the. way to Taku. He said It would
be impossible for the United States force,
small as it is, to go alone. It Is further
stated that all the United States troops
that coula possibly be spared had been
ordered to China.
This Government, presumably, is still
accepting in good faith the representa
tions made by Minister Wu, Our officials
figure that two days; must elapse before
an answer can be received from Minister
Conger (presuming he is still alive) to the
last code message sent him. In the mean
time they are bending very energy to get
tln? all % the men they can into China and
to co-operate with the allied forces In the
forward movement.

tions on Promise of Safety

THE ISSUE IN MILL VALLEY
Question of Incorporating the Town
Is the Cause of a Lively
Contest.
Special Dlr^atch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, July 27.â A lively con
test is in progress in Mill Valley between
those in favor of incorporation and those
against it. The liquor question is the real
issue upon which the fight is being made.
When lots were first sold in the town a
provision was incorporated in the deeds
prohibiting the sale of liquor on the land.
The matter was afterward carried to the
courts and a decision was made that the
prohibitory provision in the deeds was
void. Since that time the anti-liquor peo
ple have been arranging a plan of cam
paign to carry through the incorporation
of the place. If the anti-liquor people can
carry the election for incorporation they
will stand a. good show to elect an anti
saloon Board of Trustees. All of the busi
ness men down town are opposed to in
corporation and most all the residents on
the hills are In favor of it. At the elec
tion of a School Trustee some weeks ago
the two factions locked horns and the
anti-incorporators elected their man by a
small majority. Although the election
will not take place until the 25th of Aug
ust the two factions are making an active
canvass. Every man is being buttonholed
and a determined effort is being made to
swell the ranks of the contending parties.

King, the slayer, has so far eluded the Sheriffs of Marin and Sonomacounties and their posses, so young Church has
decided to take the trail, and, armed with a rifle and plenty of ammunition, he has started for the redwood forests In
Western Sonoma County, believing that King has fled in that direction. Church is a dead shot, and if he runs down King
will bring him in dead or alive.

PLOT OF WRECKERS
TO DERAIL TRAINS
Dastardly Attempts in Monterey County by Un
known Persons to Cause Disasters on
the Southern Pacific.
In Both Cases -Switches Are Opened and Large Side
Plates Are Bolted Down Over the Rails to Insure
the Work of Destruction.
Last night another attempt at wrecking was made at Camphcria. a station
farther south, and a point where the northbound mail train passes early in tha
morning. At that place the plates were more securely fastened down, and as be
fore the plan was frustrated by discovery of the obstacles on the track. These
attempts were undoubtedly made by the same person or persons, and who evi
dently have secured a switch key, as the switches -were not broken but unlocked.
A sharp lookout is being kept now and the matter will be ferreted out.
"Wednesday night some unknown person or persons unlocked the switch near
Soledad. a small station twenty miles south of here, and threw it open and. in
order to Insure a wreck, placed several large side plates across both rails, bolt
ing them down so as to Insure derailment of an early morning train. By accident
the barricade was discovered in time and removed.
SALINAS, July 27.â Two attempts at tralnwrtcklng have been mnde on trie

SALINAS. July 27.â The crime of a wayward son, the death of a wife, who
filed of prief at the disgrace brought upon her. the loss of a large sum of money
and a broken heart tfrere the causes that led Dr. A. T. Harris, recently of Ana
conda. Mont., to put on end to his life with poison in this city this morning.
Dr. Harris, a Kentuckian by birth and a graduate of the University of Vir
ginia's medical department, until several months a?o enjoyed a most lucrative
practice In Anac.onda, Mont., where he t eared a family. His chi:i3ren all died ex
cept cne son, Wayne, who left his home and went to San Francisco. There Wayne
secured employment In the messenger service. During a quarrel with a com
panion 'Wayne used a knife on his adversary with fatal effect and is now in the
San Francisco County Jail, awaiting trial.
Dr. Harris, on learning of his son's crime, immediately gave up his practice
End set out for San Francisco. He used every effort to free his son, to whom
he was greatly attached. He was very bitter in his references to the legal fra
ternity and the Police Department cf San Francisco. Dr. Harris, after his arri
val here, alleged that the lawyers he bad employed had made him pay fees for
their services amounting to $3400, and that they had rendered him no assistance
in freeing his son.
Then came the news to the despondent father that his wife had died of a
broken heart in Montana. She keenly felt tbe disgrace brought upon her by her
son, and gTlef and worry finally sapped her life. Dr. Harris, mourned bitterly
over her loss and frequently spoke of her in his conversations with acquaint
ances. -
Dr. Harris came to Salinas last Sunday afternoon, and from assertions made
it was supposed he intended to establish himself in the practice of medicine here.
He registered at the Bardln House as J. Harris. Yesterday afternoon Dr. Harris
received a letter from San Francisco, which he opened. After reading- it he tore
up the letter and afterward seemed very despondent. He stated that he had
nothing to live for and threatened to kill himself.
It is thought he took the poison that ended his life yesterday afternoon, as
he was ill last evening and retired about 9 o'clock, being seen safely to bed by
an employe at the hotej. Before retiring he tock some medicine, referring to it
as an "ar-tidote" and also an emetic. About 4 o'clock this morning the porter
found him slumbering soundly, but nothing appeared to be amiss, so he was not
disturbed. At 8 o'clock his room was again visited, when the discovery was made
that Harris was dead.
The unfortunate man's last thoughts seemed to be of his son, over whose
misfortune he so constantly brooded, for he left a note, written on the margin of
a newspaper in lead pencil, as follows:
"Do :.ot let Wayne Harris know I am dead."
On the reverse side were the words:
"Wayne Harris, Broadway Jail, San Francisco: Keep out of the newspapers."
On the bureau of his room was found a box containing a few half-gra'n mor
phine tablets. An inquest was held this afternoon by Coroner Muller at the
morgue. Several letters addressed to Dr. Harris were read. They related to
family history and affairs connected with his son. From memoranda found
amor.gr bis effects It would appear that his full name was Thomas Alexander Har
ris and that he was born November 16, IiS9, in Marion County, Kentucky.
The verdict of the Coroner's Jury was "that deceased met death from mor
phine, taken with suicidal intent."
Wayne Harris is confined In Broadway County Jail, awaiting trial on the charge
of murder. His trial is set for the 20th prox. He stabbed a messenger boy
r.amed Andrew Layden on March 24 last. Inflicting a wound from which Lavdeh
died on April S. Harris was a much smaller man than Layden, who was long
known as a bully. -They were both connected with the Western Union office a"
205 Sutter street. Layden struck Harris, knocking him down, followed him to
the etreet and continued the assault. The wound Inflicted was not considered se
rious, but blood-poisoning set in, causing his death.

Extra strain needs extra strength.
When a man begins to add to his hours
of labor, and subtract from his hours
of rest, he is putting an extra strain on
brain and body.* In such cases many
men make the serious mistake of using
stimulating liquors, or alcoholic medi-
cines. These can only inrure. The spur
forces on the horse, Dut does not
strengthen him. Stimulants are only
spurs. The need of the body is
strength. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery is invaluable to overworked
met) and women. It strengthens the
stomach, increases the blood supply,
nourishes the nerves, and gives vital
power to brain and body.
There is no alcohol in "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." It contains no opium,
cocaine or other narcotic. It is strictly
a temperance medicine.
Mr. Edward Jacobs, of Mareago. Crawford Co..
Indiana, writes: "After three years of suffering
with liver trouble and malaria I gave jrp ail
hopes of ever getting stout again, and the last
chance was to try your medicine. I had tried
all the home doctors and received but little re-
lief. After taking three bottles of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery and one vial of his
â¢ Pleasant Pellets â¢ I am stout and hearty. It is
due entirely to your wonderful medicines."

DEER HUNTERS
SEE AND KILL
MORE BIG GAME
Luck During the Past Week
Has Been Better.
"Plenty of deer;" they all say, but few
bucks are shipped to town to show the
prowess of the hunter on the ranges.
Deer are seen In numbers, accordinc to
the reports, but few. of them are killed.
Experienced hunters say that California
is well . supplied with deer for hunting
purposes and that if the present law
against the killing of does is enforced
there will soon be as many deer In the
State as there were in the old palmy days.
At the same time they claim that in a
number of counties the law is given a lax
obedience during the winter months and
this in a measure is -responsible for the
thinning out of the deer.
Last Sunday both William Berg and
Henry Oxnard got bucks weighing over
100 pounds. On Thursday George Boyd
killed a fair-sized buck. This Â»?Â»aks well
for the Country Club men, who were be
wailing their fate a short time ago.
Colonel Maus. H. E. Hall and J. A. W.
Byrne ' have been trying their rifles on
the .red bucks, but as yet have sent no
venison to the city. The deer on the
Country Club preserves are commencing
to come out and the hunting has in con
sequence Improved.
A big party of Country Club members
will be on the preserves this coming week.
Frank Carolan, Andrew Jackson. Roy
Nickels. F. W. .Van der Slcklen. William
Berg and William Kittle will be out for
deer to-day and to-morrow.
John Codman killed two bucks near
Leirly's. Mendocino County, last Satur
day. The deer are plentiful on the range.
F. G. Sanborn and Rudolph Spreckels,
guests of Charles Wheeler at his country
home on the McCloud, killed three bucks
during the week. \ /
Tom Robinson of Suisun and H. Peters
of Vacaville killed 200 and. Dr. James Mil

The time has arrived for the Sacramen
tos to do a little experimenting with tal
ent. Heretofore the Sacramento manage
ment has had nothing to worry the mind.
No player jumped his contract and all
were content with three square meals a
day. So there was nothing to mar the
work of the team. But now there is
some talk of Jay Hughes taking a rest
to nurse that rusty elbow joint which has
lately prevented an effective delivery of
his assortment of curves. It is doubtful
whether Hughes will pitch many of the
games this week. He is now congratulat
ing himself that he did not go East this
season.
Last week .was a disastrous one for the
proud and haughty Frisco ball tossers.
After several weeks of uninterrupted suc
cess it was their fate to meet the fast
paced champions at a time when they
were unprepared for a hard, struggle. The
team had been broken up by sickness and
death and they were compelled to go
against the Sacramentos with Pitcher
Fltzpatrick in right field and Pitcher
Knell at second. Schwartz being out of
the game the team was without the ser
vices of the safest striker of the aggrega

of the men across the plate In recent

and anchored there for the night. Many

trip was W. S. Grover'a yawl Arcturus,
to which Commodore II. D. Hawks trans
ferred his Oss. The commodore and his
companions were rewarded for sticking to
the schedule by a very pleasant cruise.
The wind fell light in the afternoon and
several of the yachtsmen who had gone
to Paradise Cove failed to reach their
mooriups at Tiburon in time to return to
San Francisco that night. ..?.

FROM a sport that had a most lim
ited and special class of followers
in this city, handball has within
the last three years advanced to
the most favored of all Indoor
games. It has supplanted the gymnasium
as a means of exercise and has drawn
within its ranks of devotees three-fourths
of the athletes of the Olympic Club and
a large percentage of the young business
men about town who play In the several
well established courts. So popular is
the game among the Olympians that two
new courts are being erected on the roof
of the club building to accommodate the
habitual patrons of the game.
There are two classes of players at the
Olympic Club, the expert who uses the
regulation court, a model of Its kind,
are crowded with spectators. It is quite
a feature of indoor contests at the Olym
pic Club, this rivalry between the cracka
jack teams of the city, and spirited
matches, scientific and hard fought, re
sult from the clash. Â¦,.,,, t.
But playing of scientific handball is by
no means confined to the Olympic Club.
At Ryan's courts and other downtown
alleys the game goes on day and night.
It is estimated that there are at least 1000
handball players in this city who play
the game habitually. This leaves out of
consideration an army of young
men and boys who ,use the soft
ball and play wherever residential
or fence conveniences will permit.
At both Stanford and the University of
California the heads of the athletic de
partments are contemplating the erection
of courts for the use of students, and
everywhere the game is taking a firm hold
on the public.
and the man who goes at the game for
exercise, cramming within a short apace
of time enough physical work to satisfy
all the demands of his body on the score
of health and condition. While there
are some 300 devotees of the game In the
Olympic Club the class of experts Is
small, but among this number are the
amateur champions of the State.
Although no great open, scratch tourna
ment, calling for all the amateur hand
ball players in the State, has as yet been
played, there are four men In this city,
all well known to the general public, who
are considered in a claps of their own.
T. F. Bonnet, Al Hampton. James McEl
roy and Charles Sullivan form a premier
quartet of amateur handball players.
Bonnet and Hampton play as a team,
likewise McElroy and Sullivan. As a
single player Bonnet Is generally reputed
the champion. Whenever these four men
get together on the courts both galleries

LOCAL ATHLETES TAKE
TO THE HANDBALL COURT
But for a very short time the local team
pt stickers and base runners held the ex
alted rank of second in the list. Then
came the tumble and Hank's men are now
sandwiched between Stockton and Oak
land. Two defeats at Sacramento last
week and two victories out of the series
by the Millers made the change In stand-
Ing. The champions have not yet quit
the upward movement and look upon the
other teams with a safe disdain.

Joyed for many a season. There is nothing

Lally. -who has a record for bravery, were
Informed during the day by a negro that
Charles was in hiding in a house in Clio,
near Saratoga street. The officers sum
moned a number of patrolmen to their
assistance and went to the house. The
negro Informant of the policemen accom
panied the officers. They entered the side
alley leading to the house and were
served as were Day and I-amb. The negro
was hidden behind a screen and began a
furious and accurate fire. Lally fell with
a bullet in the abdomen. PortPUP was shot
through the head and dropped dead
across the body of Lally. The other offi
cers ar.d the negro i'.ed from the scene.
The report of Charles* "Winchester and
the fact that the two officers lay bleeding
in the yard raised tremendous excitement.
Hurrv calls were sent to the Mayor, the
Chief" of Police and Colonel Wood, in
command of the special police, and armed
hosts were rushed to the scene. In a lit
tle while there was an immense crowd.
In the meantime Father Fitzgerald of
St. John's Church was summoned to ad
minister extreme unction to the police of
ficers who were dying in the alley. The
priest was anointing the body of Por
teu" Alfred Bloomfield, a your^g
boy.' standing by his side, when Charles
again appeared at the window. The lad
saw him and begged the desperado not to
Â«=hoot him. The negro, however, fired his
Winchester again, and Bloomfield fell
dead. The priest, unhurt, left the scene.
after pluckily performing tho last offices
for the dead officer.
When the ambulance arrived two men
volunteered to go into the alley and bring
out the body of Lally. They entered, and
while they were attempting to take the
body cf the dead officer from that of his
colleague Charles fired again.
The men. got Lal'.y's body out and after
ward took Porteus' body out also. In the
meantime an immerse crowd had gath
ered in the vicinity, and schemes were
set on foot to get Charles out of the
building.
Fusillade of Bullets.
Charlcs, however, did not propose to be
captured without selling his life dearly.
Time after time he came to the window,
and as men. one by one. entered the alley
he blazed away at them. In this manner

About the same time Frank Bertucci re
ceived a shot in the left shoulder and J.
Â¦\V. Bofel one In the right hnrsd.
Ultimately It was decided that the only
way to get* Charles out was to burn the
building in uhich he was intrenched.
There were, however, some scruples about
resorting to this method, the district be
ing densely populated.
partment should be called out to protect
surrounding property. At the moment of
apparent indecision some one went to a
neighboring grocery, purchased a can of
oil, end pouring it over the rear steps of
the huildir.g applied a match and soon
started a fire. It became evident very
Foon that no human being could live in
the building, and picked men from the po
lice squad and soldiers stationed th-.-m-
FÂ«-lves about the building in order to pick
off the desperado as he attempted to leave
the house. A young soldier named Adolph
Anderson, a member of the Thirteenth
Company of State militia, was one of the
first to see Charles as he left the steps.
Charles ran across the yard, and as he
did so Anderson fired several times. He
shot the negro in the breast and Charles
fell and died soon afterward.
As sot>n as the negro fell numbers of
persons armed with Winchesters *and re
volvers rushed in ar.d nred into the body.
Charles was literally shot to pieces. After
it was certain that he was dead a mob
entered the yard and dragged the body
into the street. There the police and the
mob emptied their revolvers into the
corpse, while a son of one of the mur
dered men rushed up and stamped the
face beyond recognition. There were loud
shouts that the body should be taken to
a vacant square in the vicinity and pub
licly burned. At this instant, however, a
big squad of police arrived in a patrol
wagon.
Fight for the Body.
Thousands of persons congregated In
the -vicinity and it looked as though there
would be a clash. The police somehow
seemed to have regained their courage and
promptly pushed the crowd aside, picked
up the body and threw it into the patrol
wagon. The driver whipped up his horses
end the wagon started off, with 5000 peo
ple runnirg after it and clamoring for the
cremation of the body cf the desperado.
The wagon was faster than the mob and
it ultimately made its way in safety to
police headquarters. There an immense
crowd had gathered and great difficulty
was experienced In taking the corpse or
the negro from the wagon into the
morgue. When Charles' body was stripped
it was found to have been literally lacer
ated from head to foot by the bullets.
Shortly after the body had been placed
upon the marble slab in tho morgue, a
negro woman who was alleged to have
known Charles intimately came to the
morgue and after regarding the body
carefully declared it was not that - of
Charles, but that of his brother. Sly
Jackson. Later, however. Joseph StassI,
a responsible Italian, positively identified
it as that of the murderer of Day and
Lamb.
Shortly after the body of Charles " had
been taken away a report spread that
there were still some negroes in the
burning building. The square was quick
ly surrounded by a guard of men with
Winchesters and a special squad made its
way into the burning building. In a
room which the fire had not . reached
three negroes were found dressed in
women's clothes. Thej' were hustled out
and sent to Jail in a patrol \ragon.
Mob Justice.
Subsequently, a fourth person, a mulat
to, was discovered in the building. He
made a desperate resistance and while In
the hands of the police was killed by a
shot from a pistol in the hands of one of
the disorderly mob that had congregated
In the vicinity.

CANNERS WILL
HOT TREAT WITH
THE FISHERMEN
Reject the Overtures Made
by the Commissioner
of Labor.
Declare They Will Never Recognize
the Union, and as a Result
There May Be Benewed
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. July 27.â The Ste
veston salmon canners to-night refused to
listen to any proposition of Labor Com
missioner Bremner on behalf of the fish
ermen. They say they are done with the
union and will never recognize any or
ganization n{ white fishermen.
The fishermen had to-day agreed with
J. A. Bremner, the Dominion Government
Labor Commisvicner, to recede from their
position partially and accept the offer of
20 cents a fish made by the Fraser River
canners. The fishermen had demanded 25
cents. The only concession asked by the
fishermen is that their union be recog
nized. The canners had objected to treat-
Ing with the union as an organized body,
alleging that the union was being run by
unwise agitators and Socialists, and that
if they recognized the union the men
might be continually striking for trivial
causes.
Bremner declared that the Socialist
leaders were not members of the union,
and therefore could not be treated with.
To the second objection he urged that
the canners are borrowing trouble, and
that the fishermen have a* much right to
form a union as the canners to form a
combine. The fishermen as a body go to
the river to fish, not to look for "trouble,
he declares.
When Bremner submitted the terms to
the cannera they point blank declined any
compromise. What will be done now Is
problematical. The refusal is liable to
cause trouble.
The Indians have definitely decided to
start out fishing- on Sunday night, even if
a settlement is not reached in the mean
time, and many of the white fishermen
show signs of breaking away from the
union. Chief of Provincial Police Murray
thinks that the strike may be over -by
Sunday.
it is probable that the militia will be
â¢withdrawn from Steveston on Saturdav
night unless some threatened breach oi
the peace develops to-morrow.
Run of Salmon Is Light and the Sea-
SOTTNT> CANNEES ANXIOUS.
son Will Be Unprofitable.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FAIRHAVEN, Wash, July 27.â The
salmon canners on Puget Sound arc
growing anxious over the run of fish this
year. At this time last season they had
about half their pack up, whereas they
have caught practically nothing yet. This
is what Is known as an of! year, being
considered by old fishermen the lightest
in a series of four. It is too early to
predict a failure cf the run. although the
prcspects are that it will be small. The
outlay of the companies In this vicinity in
preparing for the season was heavy. "The
Pacific American Fisheries Company
alone is said to have expended nearly
JtK'0,000. Thousands of Chinamen, under
contract to the various canneries, are
idle, and a great payroll of white labor
also goes on.

had right to take delivery of the parcel.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAJIEKTO. July 27.â Dr. H. H.
Look, commissioned by the State Board
of Health to visit the districts where
smallpox has broken out, has fulfilled his
mission and returned to report.
Dr. Look insists that the disease
has been practically stamped out
Dr. Look seems t<5 oppose the theory
advanced bv Dr. TV. J. Hanr.a, of the
State Board of Health, that the recent
appearance of the disease was due to its
having: been brought from the Kast. Dr.
Look has made a painstaking search for
the f n cts and has ascertained that the
lour-score of cases which have recently
created so much alarm wore tracable to
the fact that a cigarmaker infected with
the dl^ase had gone from San .Francisco
to Marysvllle and communicated th*
disease to a fellow workman. The cigar
niaVer soon recovered. His fellow work
men communicated the disease to one or
tvo others. A hotel man from Rio Vista

one at Rio Vista and one at Jackson â
while the number of cases in all the towns
affected reached sixty-two. t as follows:
Rio" Vista, 4 cases: Marysville 1G cases:
T ackÂ«;on, 42 cases. Dr. Look declares that
there Is immediate necessity for a num
ber of the smaller towns in the State to
give attention to the matter of better
sanitation. Improvements In this direc-
tion would do much, he declares, to re
move the dangers of disease epidemics.
i Dr. Look spoke highly of the public
spirit of the people of Jackson in comply
ing with the necessary quarantine regu
lations which he established arbitrarily,
and. as he admits, without authority of
law.
JACKSOX. July 27.â Another case of
smallpox was reported here to-day and
another house quarantined. Miss Rose
Green, employed as a printer on the
Ledper, is the victim. She lives -with the
family of Undertaker Huberty, -who has
burled the two victims of the disease.
Miss Green Is a si3ter of Mrs. Peek, who

rROM any point of view that may be taken of it,
the movement for making Admission day cele
bration one of exceptional brilliancy this year
appears of advantage to every interest of the city
and the State. Such a festival as has been arranged
for in the programme of the Native Sons, if it bi
tltly carried out, will attract the attention of the whole
country. It will bring thousands of visitors to the
city and advertise the resources of the State in a
manner sufficiently striking and magnificent to make
a deep impression upon the public mind.
In the benefits sure to accrue from the attraction oi
so many strangers to the city all business men oi
every class and line of trade are sure to profit to a
greater or less extent. Among them all, therefoie,
there should be a spirit of liberality in contributing
to the fund required for the enterprise. An enlight
ened self-interest would be in itself sufficient to
prompt to such contributions, even were there no
other incentive. It will be clear to every intelligent
mind that the more attractive the display of the cele
bration be made, the larger will be the number of
outside visitors and consequently the greater will be
the increase of trade.
The estimate that upward of $250,000 will be
brought to the city and put into circulation during
the festival is by no means excessive, provided the
outside public be well assured that the celebration
will be truly magnificent. The people of the city have
it. therefore, in their power to add profit to pleasure
by contributing a sum that will enable the Native :
Sons to realize all their plans for the occasion and
make it the most splendid and beautiful celebration
ever witnessed on this side of the continent.
For your own sake, then, as well as for the credit
of the city and the glory of the State, you should
give a prompt and liberal help to the movement. Put
up the coin. The cause is a good one. What is given
will be returned with big profits in the lively trade
that will follow the influx of thousands of visitors to
the city.

The time seems opportune for some enterprising
gambler to make a book on the quarrel of the police,
the pool-sellers and the courts, to see who will hoid
the winning hand when the issue is determined.
The New York investigators of the Cuban post
office scandals are becoming painfully facetious.
They have announced in all seriousness that the post

The only legitimate position yet assumed by the

PERSONAL MENTION.
CHINATOWN ONCE MORE.
B RESIDENT SBARBORO cf the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association is now trav
eling in Italv, and in a letter from Rome pub
lished in The Call yesterday he makes many gratify
ing statements concerning the superiority of the
United States, and particularly of California, over
Europe. He notes that the fame of our State for
beauty and for [fmtfulness i; so high in Europe that
some of the choicest pleasure resorts in the Riviera
are called "Caiifornie." and he predicts: "The time
will come, I am sure, when tourists will come to Cali
fornia from all parts of the world, for we have many
gins of nature possessed by no other country on the
It is to be regretted that in giving, that testimony
to the superiority of our State Mr. Sbarboro could
not be equally laudatory of our city. He noted in
European cities a thoroughness of public improve
ments which we have not attained here. In com
menting upon what has been done in Paris, Genoa
and Rome to ciear away the slums, and to increase
the morality and the health as well as the beauty oi
the municipality, he says: "I assure you, sir, that if
that plague spot of Chinatown was in the heart of
any city either in the United States or Europe it
would not remain there three months. It has already
cost San Frar.ci?co more than several times its value.
People I talk with cannot understand how we can
tolerate such a terrible plague spot in our midst. I
hope to see the day when a beautiful garden will take
its place."
This letter comes opportunely to recall public at
tention once more to the discredit Chinatown casts
upon the city. Xo intelligent man will â¢ dispute the
statement that "it has already cost San Francisco
several times its value." The foulness which exists
not only in its purlieu?, but in and along the main
Streets that traverse it*, brought upon us a quarantine
whose evil effects have not yet been overcome, and
remains to menace us with the danger of another
quarantine, or possibly of a plague. It is a source of
invariable surprise to visitors that such a blot upon
the city is endured, and the reports they give of it
are greatly injurious to the reputation of the com
munity.
Thi? blight upon tne city exists solely because the
health laws of the municipality are not enforced.
Were the sanitary ordinances carried out in China
town with the same degree of care that is given to
them elsewhere, the grosser evils of the quarter
would be removed at once. The question of remov
ing the Chinese from that locality is one that at pres
ent is not a practical i?sue. but the enforcement of
c!ear.Hne?s there is a practical issue, and is. moreover,
one of imperative urgency.
To remove Chinatown would cost millions, but to
compel the owners of Chinatown property to keep
their buildings in sanitary condition should not cost
any more than i? required to compel the owners of
property in other localities to obey the law. The is
sue is a simple one. It involves no problem of a
perplexing character. The application to Chinatown
of laws that are applied to every other part of the city
would, in fact, be nothing more than the adoption
of a policy of impartiality in the enforcement of or
dinances that should have been consistently
maintained from the start.
It is the duty of the Health Board to enforce the
sanitary laws, but the board has neglected to do, so.
It is the duty of the Police Department to arrest all
persons violating such ordinances, for every police
man is a health officer, but the Police Department
has been as neglectful of its duty as the Board of
Health. At thi? juncture, then, the public must look
to the Grand Jury for redress. It is true the jury
has much work to do in the investigation of the
Chretien case and the probate frauds: but that busi
ness will not occupy all of its energies. A Grand
Jury report on Chinatown ought to be speedily forth
coming, and along with the report there should b<^
complaint? against every property-owner whose
building? and premises are not kept in conformity
with the health laws.
WHERE RESPOFN3IBILITY RESTS
WHETHER the Republican party is to have a
victory in this city which will amount to a
clean sweep is Â£. question whose solution rests
with the better elements of the party. A strong com
bination made up of the railroad managers and tho
bosses of both parties has been formed to get con
trol of the State Legislature for the purpose of en
ab!ing the combine in establish the Assembly, Sena
torial 2nd Congressional districts of the State for the
coming decade. That combination the people of San
Francisco can defeat only by giving a cordial sup
pnrt to Republican candidates, and such support will
not be given if unworthy men are nominated on the
Republican ticket.
It is already notable that the Democrats, while de
spairing of carrying the State for Bryan, have sud
denly become inspired with a hope of electing z
Democratic Legislature. From what source that
hope arises is not apparent on the surface of things,
and it can only be conjectured tlm the Bryanite lead
ers have some expectation that the railroad will help
them, and that the would-be Republican bosses of the
saloon element are willing to play into their hands if
occasion serve.
Under such circumstances it is certain the Repub
lican? of San Francisco will have nothing to gain by
any compromise with Crimmins and Kelly or any of
their gang. They are already in close combination
with the railroad. Their purposes are the same as
those of the corporation. They would not be averse
to a Democratic Legislature provided they were as
sured it would carry out the railroad programme.
Upon them, therefore, no reliance can be placed, and
jr. their promises or professions there should be no
trust whatever.
The emergency is one that calls for earnest and
persevering work on the part of all the better ele
ments of the people that make up genuine Republi
canism. The professional men, business men and
the workingmen of the party should at this juncture
enter at once upon the work of campaign. It is their
duty to register, to enroll themselves as members of
the Republican clubs in their districts, to take an ac
tive part in the nomination of district candidates for
the county convention, to vote right in the primaries.
and. in short, to make the fight for honest politics
resolutely and energetically from start to finish.
Where power is lodged, responsibility rests. In thU
content the power to achieve victory for good govern
ment is in the hands of Republicans who represent
the professional, commercial and industrial interests
of the city. They can win if they make an uncom
promisinp contest for honesty and true Republican
ism. They will fall if they make any compromise
Â¦ More than io.ooo Beers, the dispatches announce,
i will migrate to the United States after the South
} Africr.n war i? over. Judging from the vigor with
I which the contest is Â¦still being waged, the migration
I is likely to be indefinitely postponed.
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.
TRANSPARENCY of "BOXER" BOGEY
A San Franciscan Gives \/oicÂ© to His Impressions
f I AVI KG taken the lead of the world in the use
I I oi automobiles for purposes of pleasure and t>t
*â¢ * trade, the French are now holding the same
proud position with respect to the use of the self
moving vehicle in war. It is stated that the French
armies are. making extensive use of the machines
for transportation- of supplies in their campaigns in
Africa, and that along the valleys of the Senegal and
tlie Niger automobiles are moving about as regularly
as any other style of army transport.
It is strange that the deserts and the jungles of
Africa should be traversed by automobiles before sucu
vehicles have been seen in many parts of the United
States. Such, however, is the effect of advancing
civilization by means of war. The improved machine
goes forward with the banners of battle much faster
than along the highways of peace, and for a while
at least the African sees sights in the way of mechan
ism that large numbers of Americans have never seen.
The success of the Freijch with the automobile
both in peace and in war has been - due mainly to the
fact that they have had the advantage of better roads
lor using snch vehicles than other nations. It is much
cosier to run an automobile along the road* of the
Niger Valley than to run one over the rough plains
of the Transvaal, and consequently French enterprise
has to that extent beaten the British. The latter,
ho.vever. are making earnest efforts to construct an
engine that can be driven over the worst sort of roads,
and from recent reports of experiments it appears
they have achieved a high degree of success.
In a recent experiment with a traction engine near
Manchester the train was made up of a locomotive
and four cars, the first carrying artillerymen, the soc
ond ammunition, the third the necessary platforms andj
pivots, etc., and the fourth two six-inch breechloading
howitzers on their carriages. The locomotive tender
carried water sufficient for a run of fifteen miles and
coal for a longer distance. The run was made across
the country, and the capacity of the machine to climb
hills and drag its load after it was severely tested.
In describing the critical point of the experiment
the Manchester Guardian says: "A real test for the
locomotive was found later on, when a plowed field
was boldly entered. After dexterous steering between
the posts of a five-barred gate the engine found no
difficulty in taking its train across the fallow.
Turning to come back, however, a slight gradient
told against progress, and ultimately the train came
to a standstill in the light, friable loam. Then spuds
or teeth of extra length were attached to the surface
cf the wheels, but >till without securing more than
the churning of the soil. But the resources of civili
zation were not exhausted. The locomotive had
simply to detach itself and go ahead, and then, by the
aid of its windlass, the train was hauled clear of the
fallow and on to the hard road again. Had it been
necessary the wagons could have been rescued in de
tail instead of en bloc. Supposing, however, that the
engine had remained fast? What then? The equiva
lent of a kedge anchor would have been laid out, and
the locomotive would have hauled on her wire rope
till she extricated herself, and then, also with her
windlass, would have brought the trucks on to firmer
ground. Sufficient took place to demonstrate the
suitability of the armored traction train for work in
rough countries like the Transvaal, and it follows
that in more civilized regions, where the principles
first propounded by Mr Macadam are more appre
ciated, the new engine of warfare would be still bet
ter able to go anywhere and do anything."
With ?uch trains and locomotives at their disposal
civilized men will not have much difficulty in over
lrnninR the barbarians. The old difficulties of trans
portation will be well nigh overcome. An army will
be able to march almost anywhere and carry its sup
plies with comparative ease.

JAMES TAYLOR ROGERS, one 01 the most
fhatneles? and rascally members of the clique
of lawyers who made a living by preying upon
the estates ci the dead in this city, has betn sent to
ja;l for contempt of court by Judge Cabaniss. The
conduct oi this notorious creature is a disgrace to the
bar oi San Francisco. Betore three tribunals thii
man has refused to answer the questions asked of him
on the ground that he would subject himself to pun
iffanent for a felony. With the same impudence
w:th which he used courts as the instruments for his
nefarious practices he now defies the courts to pun
ie-h him for his ofTenses against the living and the
dead.
He has admitted his guilt by confessing his danger
of punishment. When he was before Judge Trout:
during the investigation of the accusations made by
The Gill his attorney, with flourish of words, pleade-1
for him that when called upon he would meet any
!;3r^c wherever and whenever it was made against
Since that decoration was made James Taylor
Kopers has cringed in naked dishonesty behind every
technicality of the 3a\v. He is accused by three men
oi having levied blackmail before he would permit an
estate to be probated. If their accusations be true,
he committed perjury on the witness-stand in Judge
Troutt's court when he swore that he received no
money irs connection A-ith the Sullivan estate.
At every stage in this criminal affair he has claimed
the protection o! *hat he is pleased to call his rights
It high time .'or the courts and the Ear Asso
ciation of this city io determine what tho s e rights
.-Â»re. Are they the rights of a probate shark to feed
vpon dead men's bones, to trifle with the sanctity ~A
Â«ourtÂ«. to combine with scoundrels to filch estates by
ihe imposition of bogus heirs? If James Taylor
R'scrers cannot be compelled to answer he -should hi
forced to pav the "benalty for the crime which his
xiisswcr wotrid coniess.
The Bar Association of tlr's city, no less than the
courts, ha? a duty to perform. The indulgence which
'.his association has already shown to James Taylor
Roger* is a matter of more than passing moment. A
Police Judge ha? sent this man to jail for contempt.

The Examiner has displayed a curious !
inconsistency in recent articles regarding i
injunrtions. It hap denounced the South-!
em Pacific for disregarding an injunction
issued by Superior Judge Bahrs in the
Fresno rate case, and has encouraged the
Chief of Police of San Francisco to ignore j
an Injunction If sued by Superior Judge |
M ura sky.
The Examiner's position seems to be |
that injunctions must be obeyed except j
when that journal otherwise directs.
Among law-abiding citizens there can be j
no question in this regard. The Injunction
of a court having lawful jurisdiction !
should be obeyed by every respectable I
citizen or corporation. Disobedience Is
only justifiable rn honest legal advice that I
the court has erred and where some ques- j
tion involved ?s promptly taken to a high- i
er tribunal for review. If the object of j
the railroad company was thus to have
some point settled by the Supreme Court. I
it Is not deserving of denunciation, any
more than the Chief of Police If his course
was guided in the same way and had like
justification.
If in either case there was deliberate
contempt of court no punishment could j
be too severe.

ALTHOUGH thousands of
foreigners have lived in
China, -rery few. Indeed,
have had opportunities of
studying the Chinese from
a fair standpoint- The
Consuls see little or nothing of the
Chinese â their few visits to the
Taotai of their particular city or
district are mere visits of cere
mony that give them no Insight in
to Chinese life. The missionaries
certainly go into the interior, but
they more frequently live in for
eign built houses, they see little of
the officials, who avoid them and
treat them with contempt, and the
masses of the people avoid them
through fear of trouble. Of course
there are exceptions to this rule
among the Consuls who have lived
long in China and have acquired
the Chinese language, and have
passed through the different
grades of interpreter and Vice
Consuls, such men as Consuls
Jamieson and Brennan and mission
aries like Dr. Williams and many
of the. old French missionaries who
have passed most of their lives In
China. Among the French mission
aries particularly are to be found
the best informed men in China.
My five years In China as an en
gineer gave me many opportunities
of studying both the official:*, and
the common people from a vantage
point. I have lived among the Chi
nese, traveled hundreds of miles in
the interior in Chinese carts and
boats and have been Intimate with
some of the really best informed
foreigners In China, who mostly
are unostentatious people.
Now, It is my opinion that this
"Boxer" bogey is simply a very
transparent attempt to shift the
actions of the officials on to the
shoulders of the people. Tientsin
has always been notorious for a
very rowdy element among Its pop
ulation. The neighborhood ofTaku.
Tangku and all the salt-pancountry
to Lutal is Infested with a very
fighting element, as I know from
my experience among them when
In charge of works at Tangku.
The villagers would turn out
armed with knives and spears up
on any provocation. The salt mer
chants, who are a very wealthy
class of monopolists, controlled
large bodies of salt laborers and
junk men. who were ready to fiEjht
anybody that appeared to interfere
with their masters, waterways or
rights. But these men only act up
on instructions and the so-called
"Boxers" are merely tools of the
officials. The name "Boxer" Is of
recent coinage, and was unknown
a few years ago. Mr. Wu Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister at
Washington, whom I knew in
Tientsin, paid only the other day
that he had never heard cf the
"Boxers." I believe he was right.
In my opinion the present
trouble is traceable to the numer
ous events that have happened
during the last two years, all of
which have stirred up China in
tensely. The foreign Ministers and
diplomats have had ample reason
to study and weigh these circum
stances and to have guarded
apain-t the present trouble, which
was clearly foreshadowed. Among
these events were the acquisition
of Port Arthur by the Russians,
followed by the lease of Weihai
wei by the Hritish. both of which
concessions were obtained only
unaer pressure. Then came the
seizure of Klaochau by the Ger
mans, together with the outrage
ous German claims of rights over
the whole province of Shantung
âa province with thirty-eight mil
lions of people, the birthplace of
Confucius.
There was the passage of Mr.
Archibald Little's steamer to
Chungking. There was the
feverish anger and resentment of
the Empress asainst the reform
er Kang Yu Wei. who escaped
from her clutches only through
the assistance given him by the
British Government. The Km
press offered enormous sums of
money aÂ«? a reward for his cap
ture; she passed sentence of death
upon him by cutting to pieces as
soon as he was? caught: she has
sentenced to death all his family,
even including hi? ?^coml cousins.
The Empress wreaked her venge
ance on nis accomplices and bo
headed three Hanlin scholars â Lin
Hsia. Lin KuanK-ti and the Censor
Yang, a!so Kang and Tan Tze
hlng. son of the ex-Governor of
Hupeh. besides eleven eunuchs of
the inner palace.
The pressure of foreign nations
from without, the Introduction of
telegraphs and railways, and
everything, in fact, that tends to
destroy the old order of things
threaten to displace the older class
of officials In China, who. in turn,
resist each encroachment, and are
ready to spread rebellion through
out the whole land rather than
lose their perquisites. Headed by
that clever diplomat. Li Hung
Chang, the Chinese officials have
taken every advantage of the
greed and cupidity of each for
eign legationâ that held its hands
out. begging for concessions, and
have played one legation against
the other, deceiving and disap
pointing every one. In the mean
time the Chinese have acquired
arms and have employed foreign
drill instructorsâ the same as the
Boers did â and if they had only
been more honest among them
selves they would now be in a
position to call out "hands off"
and compel respect. But the Chi
nese officials, with some notable
exceptions such as the Viceroy,
Chang Chlh Tung, have been busy
stealing. Kang Yu Wei, the re
former, in his memorial to the
Emperor impeaches the Empress
with misappropriating thirty mil
lions of dollars and other " large
sums that had been raised for the
payment of the battleships Tlng
jrtien, Weiyuen, Chiyuen. Chen
yuen, Kingyuen. ami for the com
pletion of the Mukden Railway.
Personally. I believe Minister
Wu at Washington Is honest in
his statement about Minister
Conger's cable â but what faith can
l-e put In the Chinese telegraph
officials in China? Sherer. Ta/uai.
the present Director of Telegraphs
in China, is the most notoriously
dishonest and anti-foreign Man
darin in China who has had any
dealir.g with foreigners. Shengr
has been censured time and again
by his own Government. The Brit
ish Government has demanded his
head. Sheng was brought up by
Lady U Hung Chang; he was like
a child of the family; he lost or
st^le enormous sums of monev be
longing to Lady Li. his friend and
patron â therefore, he had to be
given a chance to regain, or steal,
this money to pay it back again,
so. in spite of repeated censures,
he was put Into lucrative offices
by the viceroy. Li. -who was ail
powerful. I remember when Sheng
was appointed Taotai of Chefu
there was a great outcry among
the foreigners and Chinese against
this appointment. The people com
plained that Sheng taxed every
fowl in the country; that he
squeezed everybody ar.d every
thing that he could wring money
from.
Minister Wu may be reliable,
for he is an educated gentleman,
and he realizes the importance of
his high position as Minister to
the United States, but no foreigner
who has had any dealings with,
or who has any knowledge of
Sheng. Taotai. the present Director
of Telegraphs in China, will put
the slightest faith In any assur
ances coming from the Chinese
Telegraph Department.
With regards to the cable from
1A Hung Chang stating that the
foreign Ministers are safe â this is
probably true. It is hard to con
fess, but It is quite possible that
the Chinese did overpower the
legations, and that the Ministers,
receiving assurances of their lives
from one of the princes, did sur
render themselves to the Chinese.
This would account for the Em
press sending imperative instruc
tions to LI Hung Chang- to come
to Peking for the purpose of
settling matters with the different
foreign Governments. This mav
be thoroughly against all interna
tional law. but if the Chinese
should hold the foreign Ministers
in their hands, they will not fail
to make th& most of this point In
settling matters, and the lives of
all the foreigners In their hands
would be in great danger If any
forward motion was made toward
Peking.

ments have been practically completed for
bringing the Olympic games, emblematic
of the world's championship, to Franklin
field, the University of Pennsylvania's
athletic grounds, in the summer of 1W4.
When plans for reviving these ancient
sports were decided upon it was agreed
to hold the first series at Athens in the
old arena where the Greeks had contested
for athletic supremacy centuries ago. It
was there in 1S35 that Princeton- and Har
vard surprised the Kuropean world by the
progress of American athletes on the
track and field.
It was agreed by the committee in
charge that the sports should be held
every four years: that they should go to
Paris in 1JVXÂ». that England should have
them in 1904 and America in IMS.
In some little correspondence the L'nl
versity of Pennsylvania athletic authori
ties had with the promoters of sports in
England before Pennsylvania's team
started abroad this year ft was learned
that the Britishers were not particularly
desirous of having the garaes in 1Â»4, and
with a little diplomacy they have been
induced to give way to America.

NEW YORK. July 27.â Just by way ot
relieving the tedium of his life as pugil

McCoy arrayed an encounter for to
night with his friend James J. Corbett.
There was the usual preliminary argu
ment as to place of meeting. McCoy, witlj
his customary thrift, wanted Corbett to
visit him at his place of business so th<Â«t
he might protit Irom the subsequent- rutu
of trane. Corbett claimed the right 10
name conditions, consequently McCoy hau
to do the visiting.
McCoy told some friends that he. had
planned a celebration in honor of renewal
of relations with Corbett. a man he had
always admired.
Corbett told his friends that he ha*1 been
betrayed by the man he had tried to be
friend. "This McCoy," he said, "isn't on
the square. I don't like him. Xext time
he comes here I'm soir.g to tell hJm to
his face what 1 think of him."
As McCoy came in he heard Corbctt's
remark and replied. "I don't know what
you are talking about, but it's safe odds
at 10 to 1 that you arc wrong."
Several words were passed, but they
v,'e,-e separated before any blows were
struck.

It is understood that Samuel M.

â¢who have been duly appointed by
the court to represent absent heirs,
Â¦will take immediate steps to obtain
permission to make a thorough
search for the missing -will. The lady
who imparted the foregoing informa
tion to them yesterday -was dis
tinctly told by a well-known lawyer
that a will was drawn at Mrs. Towns
end's direction. The document must
be somewhere among the papers. If
the signed will is not found the un
signed document drawn by the attor
ney and known to have been in Mrs.
Townsend's possession should be
produced. *
Some Will Must Be Found.
The fact was disclosed In yesterday's
statement that Mrs. Valentine, formerly
Julia Townsend of Glen Cove. N. Y., men
tioned as one of the legatees in the will of
J. C. Wilmerdlng. was a young lady to
whom one of the testator's brothers was
devotedly attached. Although her maiden
name was Townsend. she was not related
to Almira S. Townsend.
During the period of the war excitement
in San Francisco, when volunteers were
arriving by rail and departing by trans
ports, Mrs. Townsend and the lady of the
narrative were constant companions.
They dined together often â sometimes at
the "home of the lady now living and other
times at Mrs. Townsend's home. Mrs.
Townsend had an engagement to dine
with her friend of this story but a short
time prior to her death, but illness pre
vented fulfillment of the engagement.
It Is believed that the will, if it has not
been abstracted or destroyed, will be
found in this secret hiding-place. The lady
who told the story fancies that the secret
was not Imparted by Mrs. Townsend to
any other friend, but on this point she is
not positive, admitting the possibility
that one other confidential companion
may know of the repository.

simple narrative of incidents that oc

incidents spoke of having seen the secret

p*-nd. The two went together to put away
some paper of value when the contents of

sum of money In bank notes was re

THE mystery regarding: the where
abouts of the will of Almira S.
Townsend may soon be cleared
away. It is known that she had
the form of a will prepared, and
the belief that the document is some
where in the house on California street
daily and hourly grows stronger.
Yesterday Important facts came to
light. In the presence of a Call reporter
and of Samuel M. Shortridge and Colonel
George H. Pippy, attorneys for the absent
heirs of Mrs. Townsend's estate, a lady
who Is well known and highly connected
In San FYanclsco told a straight and con
vincinp story tending to establish the fact
that there is a secret recess or compart
ment In the California-street house
wherein Mrs.. Townsend deposited valu
able papers and greenbacks.
The lady, who made tho statement In
theinterest of justice, desires that her
name shall be withheld from the public,
but If m the search for the will her
presence should be needed to guide the
aper.ts of the court to the secret deposi
tor?", she will accompany ar.d enlighten
the officers of justice.
The relations which this lady sustained
toward Mrs. Townsend were intimate and
extremely confidential. The two became
acquainted during the last illness of J.
C. Wiimerding. about the time that he
went to Lop Gatos to se**k relief from ills
caused by the use of morphine to al'.ay
pain. Th* lady whose statement was
piven yesterday is related to the \\ 11
merdinjr family by ties of kin.=hip.
Friends in Time cf Trouble.
When Mr. Wilmerding died Mrs. Towns*
end was alone in her frrtef. She cast
about for sympathyâ for the sympathetic
support of some one who knew her anl
who was related by ties of kindred to her
benefactor. She sent for this lady â asked
her to come to her home and console her.
The acquaintance thus founded in the
days of Mrs. Townsend's profound sor
row and loneliness continued from that
time until death terminated it early last
Sunday morning.
Thi= confidence on the part of Mr*.
Townsend prew stronger as the years
went by. Several times she spoke of h*r
will. 6nce she said to her friend: '"I
have made my will and you are remem
bered in it." On another occasion, when
the two were on a tug to pive a fare
well Falute to the departing Montai.a
reglm.nt. Mrs. Townsend remarked to
this friend: "If anything should happe.i
to me on this trip it would be dreadful,
as I have not made my will."
The subject of a will was in her mii'd
and there is hardly a doubt In the world
that she filled in and signed the blank
testament which a well-known attorney
prepared at her direction.

The story of the secret drawer or com

11 to IS FIRST STRtET, San Franelseo, Cal.CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 27. â War between China and the powers is com
ing to be regarded here as the certain outcome of the present situation. While continuing to maintain the theory that .
the Chinese Government is not implicated in anti-foreign uprisings in China, the administration is prepared at any mo
ment to abandon this position and regard the Chinese Emperor as an enemy. The State Department continues to re
ceive Minister Wu as the accredited envoy of a' friendly power and to treat his communications as genuine and entitled to respect.
At the same time the army and navy are prepared to act with the forces of the other powers against all opposition in China,
whether from Boxers and insurgents or from the army of the Emperor.
Officials are reluctant to discuss the possibility of a general declaration of war by the powers against China, but at the
same time it cannot be concealed that matters. nre drifting every day in that direction. It is becoming more difficult to maintain
a sort of diplomatic fiction that the powers are at peace with China and are trying to assist in putting down an insurrection
against the imperial government. This Government will preserve that fiction as long as possible, but if the other powers should
declare war it probably would be difficult for the United States to avoid being drawn in with them. In this event the President
would at once call an extra session of Congress, and the policy of the United States would be determined by the law-making de
partment of the Government.
Late dispatches from the Consul General at Shanghai, which have not been made public, are understood to be decidedly
pessimistic in tone, giving little ground for the hope that the foreigners in Peking could be rescued, or that the Chinese Govern
ment could be depended upon to aid in the protection of foreigners and the restoration of order. This information, taken in con
nection with Admiral KempfFs statement that the Chinese Government is in sympathy with the Boxers, has apparently impressed
the authorities here with the idea that the imperial government cannot long be regarded as friendly., \

MEASURES TO

FEVER'S SPREAD
LONDON, July 27.â In the House of
Lords to-day the Earl of Wemyss asked
whether the Premier. Lord Salisbury, had
received information confirming the view
of one of^our military attaches to the ef
fect that it was all important that Eng
land should be made unassailable by
November and whether he had satisfied
himself that our means of defense were
such as to render all attempts at invas'lon
futile.
Lord Salisbury demanded the name of
such attache.
The Earl of Wemyssâ I cannot give It.
Lord Salisburyâ Then you have no right
to Quote him.
The Earl of "Wemyssâ Tou have no
right to ask it.
Lord Salisbury, proceeding with some
wai-isth. and the Earl of Wemyss 1 in
ability to quote the name was evidence
that the story was pure invention. He
said he had never heard that it was im
portant that England should be unas
sailable by November. He understood,
however, that a number of shooting stars
might be apprehended in November. If
his Albert Hall speech on this subject
were read in its entirety It would be seen
that he did not point to any Immediate
danger. He believed the defenses were
quite adequate and had every confidence
in the future.
The Karl of Rosebery said It was to be
regretted that the Premier had incorpor
ated so much heat in his reply. He
thought the Earl of Wemyss should not
have mentioned the anonymous attache
and said Lord Salisbury's Albert Hall
speech had intensified the anxiety of this
country by its extraordinary, Inadequate
conclusion. It was not enough to tell the
Primrose League to form clubs to pro
tect liberty, when so vast a body of re
servists were locked up thousands of
miles away. The Secretary- of War had
made innumerable statements in the
House and developed schemes of national
defense, but the commander-in-chief had
never pressed support of them. The mat
ter was grave, as Parliament would
shortly adjourn.
The Earl of Klmberley hoped the Gov
ernment would devote the remainder of
the session to seeing that everything pos
sible was done to put the country in a
condition of safety.
The subject was then dropped.

SALISBURY'S
BITTER REPLY
TO WEMYSS
WASHINGTON, July 27.âArrange
ments have practically been com
pleted for the purchase from
Spain by the I'nited States of the j
islands of Cibitu and Caravan, which
were left in Spanish possession by the
treaty of Paris, aithousrh part of the j
Philippine archiprlago.
Had the Peace Commissioners at Paris, j
In arranjdns for the relinquishment to
the United States of tbe Philippines, con
tented themselves with the phraseology j
"the Philippine archipelago," as descrip- i
five of. the territory to be ceded to the j
Ceiled States by Spain, r.o question, per- ,
haps, would have arisen over the posres- â¢
sion of these two islands. But, to avoid j
the least chance of loo&<* definition, the .
Peace Commissioners drew a geographical
boundary line around the islands to be j
tran.sfVrred. The bounds were Jixed l>y j
' meridians of longitude an<l parallels of j
latitude. The lines generally prescribed a ;
parallelogram, but at the southwest cor
ner, for some reason, there was an inset,
excluding some of the islands off the |
coast of Borneo. By the terms of the ]
treaty the southern boundary line of the I
arehipolaco Malted at the 127th meridian i
and ran alone the parallel of it' degrees
45 minutes westward to the meridian of
US decrees 23 minutes. At that point the
line ran directly northward to latitude
seven degrees 40" minutes, and thence was
deflected westward to the 110th meridian,
Sorming the f=mal! inset referred to.
Flag Raised on Cibitu.
It was a year after the signing of the
treaty of Paris before the fact was dis
covered that in laying: down these ooun- ;
daries the Commissioners bad excluded j
the Islands of Cibitu and Cagayan. It was
disclosed by the vjsit to that part of
the archipelag-o of the t'nited States
ship <"oncord. The commander of the ves
sel landed on Cibitu and was cordially re
ceived by the reigning Dato. who prompt
ly hoisted the stars and stripes and an
nounced himself under the protection of
the I'r.ited States. Attention being at
tracted to that quarter the Spar.ish Gov
ernment soon discovered that defect in the
boundary line and throuph Duke d'Arcos
set ui> a claim to the State Department
for the possession of the Islands. The de
partment took the ground that the pur
pose of the treaty of Paris in that section
was to convey the entire Philippine ar
chipelago to the United States and the
general language of the act of cession
was sufficient to effect that transfer, the
deiined boundary being unnnecessary de
scription. Negotiations lasting many
months followed and each and every mem
ber of the Peace Commission was
called upon to give his individual
understanding of the proceedings at Paris
Â«> far as they bore upon this point. Final
lv it appeared that an exact boundary
would have to bt* accepted instead of one
laid down in general terminology, accord
ing: to the fundamental principles of com
mon law.
Value of the Islands.
That being the case, It became neces
sary. In the Interest of sound policy and
to prevent the existence of a probable
cause of irritation in the future, to buy
out Spain's neighborly rights and con
tinue the two island3 as part of the
Philippine archipelago. As announced
from Madrid, the Spanish Cabinet is
favorably considering- the proposed trans
fer and the negotiations may practically
be regarded as closed on the basis of a
cash payment to Spain of $100,000 for the
two islands.
The two islands are Insignificant in area
and thinly populated, probably containing
from 6X0 to BuQO people In all. Cibitu is a
long narrow island, four miles in length
by two across. It is flat and uninterest
ing, with one small mountain in the cen
ter, about 500 feet in height. It is sur
rounded by coral reefs, with no anchorage
to speak of. Cibitu lies only four miles
outside of the southern boundary fixed by
the treaty. Cagayan Is about the same
area, five miles by eight, with mountains
reaching a height of 1100 feet. It is the
largest of half a dozen tiny islets known
as the Cagayan Sulu group, and owing
allegiance to the Sultan of Sulu. Its pro
ducts are tobacco, sugar and similar trop
ical growths. The islands are said to be
mainly valuable for their pearl and shell
fisheries, which it is possible may develop
some commercial importance.
An important consideration which has
influenced the United States Government
in these negotiations is the deslrabilir?
of excluding any European power from
the posseision of the islands as a naval
station, which would constitute a con
stant menace to the United States sover
eignty. There is reason to believe that
schemes of that kind already have been
put afloat, which are now to be thwarted.

? tion of the United States Government for the cession of the islands x
Q of Cibitu and Cagayan in consideration of an indemnity of Â§100,- V

Special Dispatch, to The CalL
TITEW YORK, July 27.â A decision
l\ I was handed down to-day by the
I \j United States General Appraisers
I In the test case involving the right
of the United States Government
to levy regular duties under the Dingley
tariff on goods coming from Hawaii. "W.
H. Crossman & Brothers, importers,
claimed that under the constitution no
duties could be levied, as Hawaii had be
come part of the territory of the United
States. The board overruled the protest.
The decision covers the period between
the annexation of the islands by joint res
olutions and their creation into a regular
Territory by the recent act of Congress.
The status of the islands since they be
came a Territory Is not passed upon. Gen
eral Somerville writes the opinion of the
board.
"The contention of the Importers," says
Mr. Somerville, " Is that at the time of
the shipment and entry of the goods the
Hawaiian Islands constituted a part of
the territory of the United States, and
that for this reason they were not subject
to duty under the Dingley act, but 'were
entitled to free entry. The right of Con
gress to levy these duties Is denied, as be
ing in conflict with the provisions of the
constitution, which provide that all du
ties, imports and excises shall be uniform
throughout the United States, and that
no tax or duty shall be laid on articles
exported from any State. It is contended
on the part of the Government that the
Federal constitution does not extend ex
proprio vigore with all Its limitations to
newly acquired territory not yet admitted
as a State; that power of Congress over
Territories is general and plenary to
make such rules and regulations for their
government as In Its discretion that body
may see fit to do.
"A further contention of the Govern
ment Is that until Congress by special
legislation extends the tariff and other
revenue laws over newly acquired terri
tory and establishes therein collection dis
tricts, with ports of entry and clearance
for vessels, such territory remains foreign
country for tariff purposes and Its ports
are not domestic ports within the mean
ing of the laws of Congress.
"The Importers, on the other hand, con
tend that Congress is a creature of the
Federal constitution: that it necessarily
derives all its just powers from the pro
visions of that instrument and that while
in legislating for territories It may prop
erly exercise the combined powers of gen
eral and of state government, neverthe
less the Federal Government is one of the
delegated powers, and all of Its legislative
authority must be exercised in subordina
tion to the principles and subject to the
limitation of the constitution.
"On these issues the decisions of courts
and opinions of juries are apparently in
a state of conflict, if not of lnextricablo
confusion. The question of the constitu
tional powers of Congress over newly ac
quired territory is conceded to be one of
great moment. Political parties have di
vided on this issue and a question purely
constitutional thus becomes political in
its nature Â¦ and consequences. It must
finally be settled by an authoritative de
cision at the hands of the highest Judicial
authority in the landâ the Supreme Court
of the United States, the final arbiter of
all such disputed judicial questions. In
view of this well-settled principle and of
the conflict of authorities, the board
thinks it proper to overrule the protest
and affirm the Collector's decision, which
is accordingly ordered."

has had in being locked up for assaulting
the woman- he promised to love and cher-.
ish. Ten months ago he kicked his wife
in the stomach so brutally that her life
was despaired of. After being confined
in the City and County Hospital for sev
eral weeks she eventually recovered and
declined to prosecute her husband. Yes
terday he smashed a pitcher over her
head, cutting her in a fearful manner.
The unfortunate woman was seen on the
street near her residence, on Knterprise

and Eighteenth streets, all covered with
blood. When questioned by the arresting
officer she feaid her husband had struck
her with a pitcher.

Intimates That^Choynski's Officious
Actions Lost His Client a Horse
shoeing 1 Contract.
It was broadly intimated by FireCom
{ missioner Hecht during: tho hearing of
j the Kennedy injunction proceedings be
fore Judge Hebbard yesterday that but
for the "disagreeable and officious^'
actions" of Attorney Herbert Choynski i
and his clients, Horseshoers Kennedy and |
Graney. Kennedy would have been award
ed a contract and saved the necessity of.
going to court in an effort to obtain de
| partment business. Many witnesses were i
called during the day to testify regarding |
the number of bar shoes and pads used j
on department horses. Fire Commis- i
Â«ioner Hecht Â¦was then called. He said
tbat as the figures showed ORourke's bid
to be the lowest for bar shoes, more of
which than any other kind were used by
the department, he considered his bid the
lowest, as did his associates, and hence
awarded him the contract.
A question asked the witness by At
torney Choynski opened hostilities. With
out answering- the interrogation, Hecht,
addressing the attorney, said:
"If you and your clients had been less
disagreeable and officious you might have
had a better chance to get a contract.
The board did not feel very kindly toward
Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Graney after their
many personal assaults. You and Mr.
Graney, I concluded, were the two most
disagreeable men I ever had the displeas
ure to meet.
"Don't you know that as a public serv
i ant you a"re liable to these displeasures?"
I responded Choynski.
"I understand that proposition thor
' oughly. but 1 don't think your intelli
gence is of a quality which entitles you
to attempt to tell me my business, and
I don't think that you can," responded
Hecht.
"I think I can." said Choynski.
"I think you won't," responded Hecht,
hotly.
An objection from Attorney Costell%
representing the Fire Commissioners, was i
i seized upon by Judge Hebbard to end the \
i quarrel. :

alleged status and object for the exist
ence of the Santa Rosa Island Company.
This assertion is made by Eliza M. Mil
ler, executrix of the will of the late A
P. More, and Cornolia A. Baldwin, in a
cxÂ»nt<-st tiled yosterday to the application
of the company named for distribution
to it of wool and sheep belonging to the
ilore estate.
In the contest It is allesed that Eleanor
H. More, who was entitled to one-eiphth
of A. P. More's estate, died in March
of this year. Six months prior to her
doath. the contestants continue, she was
mentally incompetent. Taking advantage
of that fact, John F\ More and Peter \V.
Watson entered into a conspiracy to de
fraud her. They induced her to execute
a power of attorney to Watson authoriz
ing him to deal with her interests. They
falsely asserted to her, it is claimed, that
A. P. More was in his lifetime largely
indebted to them and that the contest
ants, Mrs. Miller and Cornelia A. Bald
win, were endeavoring to deprive them
or their rijrhts. On these assertions. It is
alleged, -they enlisted the sympathies of
Eleanor II. More and, it is averred, to aid
thorn the deceased executed the power of
attorney. Then John F. More and P. W.
Watson induced her to make a will be
queathing them her interest, which â¢ is
valued at $.vt.00<i.
The alleged fictitious corporation was
then formed, the contestants claim, and
in view of the fact that the will of
Eleanor H. More, bequeathing her prop
erty to John F. More and P. W. Watson,
is being contested, they pray that tho
Santa Rosa Island Company, "which has
no legal interest in the estate," be denied
the right to receive and dispose of the
property named.
Shortly after this answer was filed
Judge CofEey called for hearing the ap
plication of the executrix of the More
estate to sell Mescaltitan Island, a tract
of land consisting of sixty acres, in Santa
Barbara County. The sale of the land
was confirmed to C. C. Sherman and Mr.
Rowe for $4100.

The insurance companies are maklnp an
effort to locate and raise the pilot boat
Bonita that was sunk by a whale off the
Famllon-irf a few days ago; Early yester
day morninpr the tup: Ida W went out to
the Fpot. where the vewl wont down ana
began dratrRingr for her. The pilot boat's
kertge anchor was down when she began
to nil so the chances are she has not
drifted very far. Should the Ida W locate
the wreck an attempt will be made to
raise and bring her into San Francisco,
where she will be repaired.
There is a considerable amount of in
suranc on the Bonita and the underwrit
ers do not like to pay it out without first
attempting 1 to recover the vessel. The in
surance men seem to think that the dam
age to her is not so very great and that
a few thousand dollars may raise and
repair the vessel. In any event the trial
is being made. It was not successful yes
terday, but another try will be made to
dar.
The pilot boat America has taken up the
Bonita's cruise. She was formerly a white
vessel, but Captain F. Jordan has had her
painted black for the occasion and now

POSTUM CEREAL^
INTENDED FOR OTHERS.
Difficult to Believe Advice Applies
to Ub.
"While reading the morning paper at
1 rcakfast, I frequently read over the ad-
vertisements of Postum Food Coffee
; ;i<l finally began to wonder if it \vas a
fart.th.it my daily headache and dyspep-
sia were cue to coffee drinking.
"It never occurred to me that the
jtf>mir)fi fitted my case.
\ "1 had been on the diet cure for more
than ten years, having tried a strictly
iv.er.t diet, also a strictly vegetable diet,
and at other times left oft breakfast for
rt tiir.e ?nd acrain left off dinner, but all
these efforts were futile in ridding nic
of the steady half-sick condition under
which I labored.'-
"I had never once thought of over-
Â¦Jiauling 'dear old coffee,' but when
it lir.ally occurred to me to make the
trial and take up Postum. I immediately
discovered where the difficulty all these
years came from. I now cat anything
t'er ?jre--ik!ast. as much as I desire, doing
justice lo a good meal, and the same at
Junch and dinner, with never a headache
or Other disagreeable symptom. Mj'
only 'crankiness' now is "to know that I
â¢have Postum served as it should be
made, that is, properly boiled/ There is
a vast difference between y<oorly made
Postum and good.
"C. E. Hasfy of Alameda. Cal., insists
that he ow/Â»Â« his life to me because I in-
troduced h:m to Postum. I have a num-

Kxport business would undoubtedly expand
if ship rcom were available. Among other
metals tin is locally lower on freer arrivals
after touching the highest price In twenty
years.
Unfavorable elements In trade probably find
their chief and greatest exposition in the Iron
and steel business. That industry Is. If possi
ble, more depressed than at any time for three
years past., and expectations that price declines
would be checked by the arrival of finished
matter at a cost basis have been disappointed
because this week steel bars have been sold in
some Instances at 1 cent per pound, which iÂ«
unquestionably below the basis of cost of raw
materials and manufacture. That a large ton
nage of this material and Southern pig iron has
been worked off seems certain, but it |s still a
buyers' market with everyhtlng that this
implies.
NEW YORK, July 27.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Important changes In trade and
speculation are notably lacking this week, but
counter-currents of demand In various sections
and Industries lend a rather more than usual
ly Irregular appearance toMhe general situa
tion. Among the notable features calling for
notice are the practical assurance of an Im
mense corn crop by the recent copious rains in
the further \\ est, the continued cheerful re
ports from the sections which have gathered
and are now marketing a large winter wheat
crop, advices of continued improvement In tone
in the Xorthwest. with reports of renewals of
earlier canceled orders for fall goods fairly
satisfactory gains in gross railway earning!
less weakness in prices of the country's leadl
ing cereal products,, based apparently on re
newed buying of their export and rather more
inquiry for wool by manufacturers.

WHEATâ The local market showed no change
worthy of note, and continued dull.
Chicago opened firmer on better foreign ad
vlcos, but the crowd was bearish and foreigners
were selling. Receipts were diminishing. There
was a good shipping demand, however, and IÂ».
000 bushels were taken for export. The sea
board generally reported a better tone abroad,
and a better demand, which made operators
bullish. The Argentine reported a favorable
outlook, the weather being warm and rainy.
Wheat looks well there, but corn only middling.

j Dullness has been the rule this week. Specu
lative activity has shrunk to the narrowest
proportions and a heavy tone is shown, due to
the increased attention the public markets here
are giving to the Chinese situation. The un
settled recurlty markets and the hardening In
money abroad have resulted in moderate but
fairly steady selling of American stocks by
; foreigners. At the same time the advance in
1 open market discount rates at London to above
4 per cent and the hardening of exchange here
created a feeling that heavy gold shipments
from New York to London may be anticipated.
The movement of the markets abroad this week
was favorable 10 London and adverse to Paris,
the rise of sterling rates at the latter city In
particular making the triafleular markets
through which gold has been shipped from New
York to Paris no longer profitable. No gold
was therefore sent out on the French steamer
sailing on Thursday, but as demand sterling
had been advancing to nearly $4 88, it was ap
preciated that only the direction of the goW
outflow had been changed and that London
would from now on be the probable destination
of these shipments. The foreign Influences were
thus generally unfavorable to the market here.
.At the same time the local factors, while not
oearish, did not encourage bullish demonstra
tions. Time money gives Indications of hard
ening under the prospect of gold shipments, and
a conservative feeling over Chinese complica
tions has an effect on the action of lar"e In
terests. The Investment demand for dividend
paying docks noted early in the present month,
has subsided, and the public is not inclined to
take part In speculation at present. Floating
supplier of rno?t stocks are. however, small,
and there Is still no disposition on the part of
the actual holders of securities to sell them.
The situation as regards the corn crop Is con
sidered satisfactory, but while railroad earn
ings continue In the n-.aln to increase, the fact
that weekly returns of such an Important road
as the St. Paul have exhibited decreases since
the beginning of the month exercises mere In
fluence than It is entitled to do in view of the
fact that the reduced spring wheat yield neces
tarily affects the business of all Xorthwestern
roads and those of the St. Paul system in par
ticular. " .'- VÂ».
NETW YORK. July 27.â Eradstreefs review of

Nrjv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 27. â The room traders suc
ceeded in putting prices up for a time to
day, but they drifted downward again toward
th* close of the day and left only small net
pRir.s except in Brooklyn Transit. This Etotk
was tfe^idedly the leader of the speculation

rr.a<ie an extreme rise of over three points
under this stimulating Influence and helped
the whole market. It relapsed a point In the
1st- reaction when the traders were takirR
their profits on the day'e rise. Sugar, which
came next in point of activity, did not farÂ«Â» J
f well. It got up at one time 1% on Â»hc
expectation that the flrmnen of the raw
eugar market foreshadowed another advance
In refined f=ugar. but the late reaction entirely

extremely dull and narrow. The sharp galrs !
Bhown by a handful of nocks had little in- j

sluggishly back. Gains of over a point were I
Â«Mu.blished In half a dozen stocks at the mM

Smaller Hog receipts and the grain strength
caused some liberal covering by shorts In the
provision pit and this, combined with a good
cash demand and higher prices at the yards,
caused a strong advancing market in Hog
products. September Pork closed 35c over yes
terday, Lard 12Hc higher and Ribs 10@12M>c
better.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Trading In oats was somewhat limited, but
the tone after some easiness during the first
part of the session was firm. September closed
iifi'ic Improved at 22?4522%c.
Corn was again quoted higher at Liverpool.
The shipping demand was excellent. Septem
ber closed "4@lc over yesterday at 3S%c.
CHICAFO, July 27.â Two helping hands, one
a good export demand for American Wheat,
the other a rise at Liverpool, were held. out
to Wheat when trade began to-day, and Sep
tember, grasping the opportunity, changed
hands higher than the close yesterday
at 7CV4 to 75?Â»c. An additional element of
strength was that the Argentine shipments,
1,400,000 bushels, according to Bard's figures,
were comparatively moderate, and ' another
was that the Liverpool advance was partially
due to a shrinkage of 9,600,000 bushels In the
estimate of the English crop. Following the
opening there was enough selling, mostly by
scalpers, for profits to send September back
to 75%c, but at no time did the bulls show
any fear of the market taking the downward
course for any length of time. During the
day there were numerous reports of unfavora
ble crop conditions In the Northwest and ex
ceedingly poor thrashing returns. One Dakota
man expressed a wish to go on record that
the Crop in his territory would not be 10 per
cent of last years. To this bullish array Texas
added her mite by complaining of heavy dam
ages from rain. There was a good cash de
mand all day and the situation was further
helped by reports of good export sales in other
citie?. September gradually rose on a mod
erately active demand to 76%c and closed
strong, %f<*ic over yesterday, at 76%c

British Columbia with 13.3C0 tons: five from

S0O tons. Total. 2S.M3 tons. There have been
no deliveries of foreign coal. An absurd article
was printed this week in one of our dailies,
intimating the doubling of coal prices thtj
year. There are no grounds for such state
ments. It Is true the quantities delivered
closely approximate to the amount consumed,
but we are not threatened with a fuel famine,
hence such heavily leaded headlines are very
misleading. When the present Alaska pressing
demand for fuel has been supplied we will be
enabled to have a larger supply of British Co
lumbia to draw from, and more vessels to
transport It. Besides, there are points along
the Central Paciric from which fuel may be
drawn In case any marked advance should be
made here. High prices will open up a num
ber of new avenues at all times. Up to date
large consumers may feel grateful that our
coast colliery proprietors have not even shown
the semblance of any Intention to squeeze
them, although they have had the power to
do so for over a year past. Grain freight?
outward have softened somewhat this month.
This will have a further tendency to advance
foreign freights inward on coal. The present
schedule of prices for Australian and English
coals will tend to diminish shipments in this
direction. Latest quotations show an, advancÂ«."<
SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.

Â».*. Bar silver, firm; 28d per ounce. Money.
3 Per cent.
Failures for the week were 231 in the United
States against 151 last year and 23 in Canada
against 20 last year.
It was not at all surprising that Wheat de
clined still further this week, for the price
had been held far above the quotation ruling
at this date in 1S99, and crop conditions are so
generally satisfactory as to assure an abund
ance for all home requirements and the usual
amount for export. High prices have curtailed
foreign buying to some extent and in four
weeks Atlantic exports of wheat. Including
flour, have been 7,266.436 bushels against 8,830,
331 last year.
Similarly In Iron, the depression in which
has resulted in hesitation and fear in other
industries, tbe tone is better, and in the Pitts
burg district the mills have booked a line
of fair orders in bars and platea. Structural
and bridge materials are better taken. The re
fusal of the Amalgamated Association to allow
a change in the wage scale adopted in May has
led tb .strikes 'at numerous bar mills, and the
Republic Company Is to dismantle some plants
to secure concentration, but the non-union ca
pacity will prevent serious scarcity. Further
business in bars shows that agricultural im
plement makers are active. Grey forge has
fallen to $15 at Plttsburg and Bessemer steel
billets sold at $19. With the uncertainty of
the conference of the steel companies at Chi
cago removed buyers may proceed with less
anxiety. Export orders advanced Electrolytic
Copper from U% to 16%c, In large lots. Job
bers in boots and shoes are demanding prompt
delivery on old orders, but new business is
scarce. Manufacturers are taking leather only
for immediate needs, but sole is more active
and a large sale for belting at a moderate
concession is reported. Packer Hides sell freely
at Chicago at the recently reduced price, f
A stop to the decline In wool brought many
manufacturers Into the market asking terms.
Good sales of California and Territory Wools
were made to mills and the trade expects
larger purchases to follow the opening of spring
goods by the American Woolen Company next
week. Holders who have had difficulty In stor
ing were the chief eellers. Sales of wool at
the three chief markets were only 4,337,500
pounds against 10,773,500 pounds last year.
Speculative activity in raw materials Is not
present to discourage new business. Producers
and consumers are getting together In more
than one direction, although midsummer in
activity Is emphasized by disturbed foreign re
lations and hesitation always attending a na
tional political campaign. False starts are to
be feared, but the dangerous optimism of last
autumn Is lacking and new business is at low
er prices.

Offlceâ 327 Sixth Street.OAKLAND. July Â£7.â Ne!s Peterson, the
31.4-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. N. Peter
son, died at his home in San Lcandro to
day from thQ effects of a severe scalding
received two c"ays ago. The child was
playing around the kitchen Wednesday
morning. While the mother was tem
porarily absent from the room the little
boy manoped to j>u!l over a kettle that
was resting on the edge of the stove top,
and the steaming hot water splashed over

Tet there is a curious duplicity In Poe's
nature. >?o one has written more enter
tainingly than Poe. on the theory of tech
nique and on practical problems of con
struction as such. No one. to Judge by
his confession, could well have been more
, self-conscious in his artistic methods, in
his choice of subjects, in his search for
telling situations, in his calculation of ef
fects, and even in his selection of a tone.
a vocabulary and a metrical scheme. In
his analysis of the genius of the tale, of
its scope and mode of composition, ho dis
sects with the prettiest kind of exactness
and minuteness the processes that his
: own mind must have gone through In the
construction of his now so famous short
stories. To judge by this treatise, one
might fancy that there was nothing spon
taneous In Poe's writing, that he con
cocted a story as a mathematician might
calculate a table of logarithms by the
help of perfectly describable formulas
and mathematical processes. Â«
This union of apparent spontaneity with
what after all looks on consideration like
ingenious and elaborate design is charac
teristic of all Poe's works. In his "Tales"
the supposititious narrator seems swept
along by a resistless flood of mere facts,
under the sway of feelings that cannot be
controlled; he Feems a naively Impetuous
relater of personal experiences, and yet he
is always incorrigibly self-possessed: and
Â«he stops now and again, as In the "Fall
of the House of I'sher." to theorize about
his sensations, his passions and his par
oxysms of fear, and to give proof of de
monic intellectual neuteness and subtle
ty. Moreover, when the sophisticated
reader takes to pieces any one of these
stories, even the most morbid and phan
tasmagoric of them, he finds it a marvel
of delicately sure construction, wrought
apparently with conscious and theoretical
purpose in every phrase. In every quota
tion In the choice of every sensation and
decorative detailâ almost, one Is tempted
to say in every cadence. It is from the
application of this absolutely sane method
to the treatment of delect ably morbid,
gorgeously impossible, splendidly menda
cious material that Poe's "Tales" derive
much of their peculiar power. He writes
like a Babbnge calculating machine that
has gone into an opium trance.
Poe Is a specialist in sensations. He Is
lavish of colors and sounds, odors and
tastes, and he Is tinglingly alive to the
emotional quality of each. Whatever ca
resses the senses, whatever appeals to
them keenly-even to the sense of smell
he delights to report. "The senses were
oppressed." he tells us in one place "by
mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking
up from strange convolute censers. Ex
quisite vintages, luscious viands, the
flashing light of carbuncle, topaz, ame
thyst and turquoise the smooth hard

Two masked highwaymen held up a
drug clerk in the drug store of Clinton
K. Smith at the .corner of Eighth and
Peralta streets shortly after 10 o'clock
this evening, taking $20 In coin and all of
the postage stamps in the drawer. Then
they made their escape.
Henry Partious. the clerk in charge of
the store, was just closing up as the
lights on the 10 o'clock circuit went out,
when the two men stepped quickly into
the store. Both wore black masks, which
I'artious describes as being of the regula
tion highwayman style. As nearly as he
can remember they wore dark clothing
and were of medium height^ and the most
striking thing ?ilÂ«out them was an array
of firearms which Partious admits car
ried Â»terror to his heart. One of the men
placed a revolver at his head and other
wise made it uncomfortable fur Partious.
while the other went through tile till.
Everything that could not be traced was
taken. Â»
Then the m<*n disappeared Into the
darkness, telling the clerk that if he came
to the door they would shoot him. Par
tions waited a few moments and then
telephoned to the 'pol'" 1 station and re
ported the affair. MÂ«*n were instantly
detailed upon the case, but up to a late
hour ro trace of the men had been found.
There is no clue, and the men had quite
a eonplderable start of the poiiee, for the
drug store Js situated in West Oakland
ne.irly two miles from the police station.
The men had ample time to throw their
disguises into snmt dark corner and catch
a train U> Kan Francisco, or to hide in the
railroad yards near by. a favorite hiding
place for those who wish to escape the
police.
The place where the hold up occurred
is in a thickly populated tlistrict.

morninp 'while at his farm at Sunol.
Mr. Nusbaumer was sitting quietly In a
hammock at his residence when the stroke
came. A physician was summoned from
Pleasanton, who after rendering: what as

STRICKEN WHILE
LYING QUIETLY
IN A HAMMOCK
"Have Mr. and Mrs. 'Charley' Dickman
agreed to disagree?" This is the question
that is agitating Bohemia, the smart eet
and society generally.
On June 17 Mrs. Dickman filed a suit,
making her pay spouse defendant in di
vorce proceedings on the pros;ilc ground
of "failure tb'provlde.'. A short time be
fore the suit was put on record Mrs.
L'ickman returned to San Francisco from
Paris. This fact alone did not of course
count for much, but who'' society remem
bered that the solitary traveler had gone
Co Europe on a tour, accompanied by her
husband, tongues began to wag. Then
came the divorce proceedings and society
whispered behind fans and wondered
where "Charley" Dickman was.
Last Saturday that gentleman solved
the riddle by turning up himself. It was
an unostentatious arrival, and the ex
bon vivant has lived an unobtrusive life
since then. The Bohemian Club, where
once his fieure was as familiar as Uncle
George Bromley's, knows him no more,
and the new member sits in his favorite
chair.
Down on Montgomery street, at number
728, there are some dingy studios. Here
Dickman has ensconced himself. A paint
ing-room and suite are going to be fixed
up, and in these, says the returned wan
derer, he will settle down and work. On
the subject of the- pictures he will paint,
the kind of carpets- he will have and
what tones will match the wall paper
Jlr. Dickman is voluble, but on the sub
ject of the divorce he is silent. But from
what bis friends say, and from dark hints
he himself lias dropped, he is apparently
content to let well enough alone. The
only thing that puzzles the gossips, club
dom and Bohemia is why he returned to
San Francisco. The free life of the West,
says Mr. Dickman, and as nobody can
ofter a better explanation this reason
goes by default.
Dlckman will stay with his father, at
2fi45 Parker street, FJerkeley, until the
painters get through with his Montgom
ery-Street flat, when, he says, he will
start in to be a Bohemian in earnest.
.vlrs. Dlckman is a charming woman of
30. and since- her return from Paris has
resided with her aunt. Mrs. Captain
Batchelder. Her little Rlrl is with her.
and she is apparently as unconcerned
over the pffair as her husband. She is
an accomplished and highly trained
singer, possessing a contralto of rare vol
ume and quality. Dicktnan is an artist of
more than local reputation, a bon vivant,
clubman and general good fellow.

"With a wild yell those dnaky warriors
at the command of Captain Fuller made a
rush for the flames. Grabbing sacks and
blankets as they ran and breaking off
huee brniichos from the trees in the vi
cinity they attacked the fast-spreading
Maze. Smoke so dense that they could
not see one another proved no obstacle.
VISITORS at the Presidio yesterday
had the opportunity of seeing the
famous Ninth Cavalry in action.
Shortly after 2 o'clock three shots
In rap!*' succession fired by the sentry on
duty near the end of the Union-street line
brought the colored troopers to their feet,
r^ady in a moment for any emergency.
The grass to the left of the car station
was burning fiercely and in a moment
rr.ore would be beyond control.
Right Into the thjekest of it they went,
never pausing until the recall was sound
ed announcing that all danger was passed.
In ten minutes the fire had spread over
two seres of prounrt, and had it not been
for the promptness of the "Ficrht'ng
Ninth" a serious conflagration might have
resulted. The other troops at the post
were quick in answering the alarm, but
had much farther to travel to reach the
scene.
The batteries of the Third Artillery will
leave their camp early this morning and
embark on the Hancock, which will prob
ably snil at daybrenk Sunday morning.
The hk-h are highly pleased at the near
ness of the time for a chance to distin
guish themselves. They are all picked
men, capable of withstanding any hard
ship rind able, as they pay themselves, "to
do un tkree lioxers per man." On leaving
the Presidio they will march down Lom-
bard street to Van Kess avenue, along
Van Ness avenue to Market street and
down Market to Folsom-street dock.
The bodies of ninfe soldiers who died In
Manila were buried yesterday at the Pre

On board the transport Warren, which

HEROES OF SAN JUAN HILL FIGHTING A NEW FOE.
The tone In which these gorgeous or
mystical visions are recited is also char
acteristic and noteworthy. Strangely out
of place In a "dreamer" seems the Im
petuosity of the sentences In Poe's Talea
â their swift rapidity of utterance. They
run along in a monotone of frenzied ea
gernessâlike the soliloquies of a mono
maniac. Poe's prose st-ems terribly tense,
as if written in a half hysterical mood of
excitement: with ail its sensuousnesa ami
pictorial quality, it has an acrid Intellect
uality and strenuousness of accent that
suggest an overstlmulated brain and a
morbidly irritated nervous system rather
than the relaxation of Â¦will and the blurr
ing of the senses that are supposed to fro
with visionary dreaming. The Intellect
and the sensea seem abnormally alert
rather than soothed into quiescence. Alt
the details in Poe's landscapes, even when
he is painting mysterious twilight re
gions, are glaringly clear, as if revealed
by a blue flash of lightning:.
It must, of course, not be forgotten that
Poe wrote purely intellectual tales a? well
as "Romances of Death," "Old WnrM
Romances." and so on. In the "Tales of
Ratiocination" the demonic Ingenuity that
pven in the romances can be detected on
analysis has full sway. The juggling 1
with Ideas is preposterously clever. Not
more in these Tales, however, than in
the roraancea is there anv pretense tr>
portrajr actual life: the heroes of th-i
purely intellectual tales are hardly more
normal or possible than the T'shers and!
other neuropaths of the confessedly ro
mantic type of story. They are merely
Babbagre calculating machines without the
opium.
And this suggests at once what is per
haps the most serious and damaging
criticism that can be made on Poe's work
as an artist. He Is not an Interpreter of
life. Not even indirectly are tliTe re
cognized in his art those traits of char
acter, those impulses, motives, feelings
end habits of thought nnd of conduct and
those ideals that for most sane men make
life worth living and lmurt to it it-Â»
quality. The prose or the poetry of such
great dreamers as Shelley and De Quincey
is essentially human In spite of its vls:
ionariness; even when most audaciously
imaginative and unreal it usually pre
serves some orienting power over the
reader as regards what Is normal In life.
Poe. on the other hand, is 'the artist Ir
responsible. He plays fantastically ami
almost frenetically on the senses and the
imagination. Very often the effect of his
prose on the reader's nerves is like that
of romantic music â of Chopin or Tschai
kowsky. If literature were merely a re
fined substitute for opium Poe would bo
the greatest of American writers. As it
is. he is at least unirjue as an artist and
our most brilliant master of techninuÂ«Â».
LEWIS E. GATES.
Harvard University.
The first thing to bear In mind In appre
ciating Poe Is that he lived by his pen.
His prose and his poetry alike were
dashed off with the printer's devil at his
elbow. When we take this Into account
and then compare his writings In their
extent and variety and range of Inform
ation and finieh with those of our mod
ern litterateurs we cannot but be amazed
at the fecundity of Poe's genius, at his
apparent power to Improvise and at the
marvelous and peemingly Instantaneous
finish of much of his work". Nine large
volumes are needed to hold his prose, and
much of this prose, casual as must have
been Its origin, has a burnish of surface
and a strength of structure "that have for
now many decades been the delight of the
most exacting lovers of technique, of puch
men as Baudelaire. Barbey L'Aurevllly
and Stephane Mallarme. The language of
art seems to have been Poe's natural
idiom; he Is probably without a rival
among American authors In the lnevl
tableness and persistence of his Instinct
for artistic effect and in the sureness and
facility of his command of the artist's
means and material. He crystallizes
whatever goes through his mind.
the glinting magnificence of silk and
damask hangingsâ all these eensatlon*
and countless others equally vivid Po*
weaves seemingly without an effort Into
the texture of, hla "Tales." Moreover,
every sensation brings with it some note
of feeling that reinforces whatever com
posite mood Poe may be aeeklna: to induco
in his reader. Nor is he any less sure in
his evocation of natureâ of nature that
may be barbarlcally splendid or mystical
exceedingly, and charged- with fate.
Every one knows tne Valley of the
Many-colored Grass in "Eleonora." the
serpentine trees, the River of Silence that
flowed "through a shadowy gorge"' and
"the dark eyelike violets'* and "the ruby
red asphodels" of the valley. Every one
knows, too, "the yellow ghastly water*
Of the River Zaire in Silence" and "th>Â»
pale legions of the water lilies" and thÂ»Â»
unforgettable hippopotami that "dwelt.
among the fens" and "came and roared
loudly and fearfully beneath the moon."
Riotous details of this sortâ Retails of
color and sound and form â Poe's imagina
tion offers him with apparently inexhaust
ible fecundity. And all of these details
he uses with a marvelously sure knowl
edge of color â chords of feeling so as to
cast abouj some single figureâ some
strange, solitary griever â or about the
victims of a fateful passion, an irresist
ible atmosphere of emotion.

GALLANT COLORED TROOPS
FIGHT FIRE AT PRESIDIO
GEORGETOWN, Ky., July 27.â The
prosecution placed its star witness, F.
Wharton Golden, on the stand in the Pow
ers conspiracy trial this afternoon, and
unless its present plans are changed will
rest the case at the conclusion of his tes
timony to-morrow.
Golden went over the details of the or
ganization of the mountain people, who
were brought to P'rankfort. It was the
purpose of the men, himself included, to
kill off enough Democratic legislators to
give the Republicans a majority. Louis
\V. Hampton, a Kepublican member of
the Legislature from Powers' home
county, gave sensational testimony
against both Powers and Governor Tay
lor. Hampton testified that Taylor wanted
the Keput-Iican mob to start a fight in the
House and assured him that he as Gov
ernor would back them up.
A Dr. Blngham and other men were
paid money to come, he said.
Powers, who was presnt. spoke approv
ingly of the plan to kill the majority of
the Democratic Legislature, mentioned by
a mountain man.
On the day before the shooting witness
saw John Powers give Youtsey the keys
to the Secretary of State's office, and later
Powers told him they had secured two
negroes. Mason iiocker and "Tallow
Dick" Combs, to kill Goebel. On the
morning of the assassination the witness
and Caleb and John Powers and Walter
Day went to Louisville. Before leaving
witness was in the Secretary of State's
office. Governor Taylor was there, as
were several men from the mountains.
. E. J. Howard of Harlan County wanted
the Governor to call out the troops, but
the Governor replied:
"You all must act first."
Witness walked home with Governor
Taylor one evening and the latter asked
him if he and the other mountain men
would back up a Republican member of
the Legislature if a fight should be pre
cipitated, and further along in the con
versation he said:
"Golden, it looks like a horrible thing to
kill a man, but that looks like the only
way to handle Goebel and his gang."
â¢ The cross-examination was begun, but
had only progressed a little way when
court adjourned.
The first witness called was Judge
James D. Black of Barboursville, who
was a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Governor before the re
cent State convention. He testified as
to the letter which Powers wrote James
Stevens of Barboursville, February 20, in
which the statements. "I am largely
responsible for the disorganized condition
of the Democrats" and "I am an open ad
vocate of war." were used.
Private Dudley Williamson, who was a
member of the military company which
took charge of the Statehouse immediate
ly after Goebel was shot, testified that the
members of the company were drawn up
in the arsenal that morning, prior to the
shooting. Witness said that the company
had been kept Inside the arsenal after the
Legislature met. but previous to that day
had not been uniformed.
H. D. Sinclair, former manager of the
Postal Telegraph office at Frankfort, testi
lled as to many teleprams sent through
his office before and after the shooting.
Some related to calling out the militia,
others to supplies for the mountaineers
who came to Frankfort before the shoot
ing.
George Weaver of Denver. Colo., was
the next witness. He was in Frankfort
at the time of the assassination and was
just entering the rear of the capitol
grounds when the shot was fired. The
witness looked in the direction of the ex
ecutive building and saw the muzzle of a
gun pointing from the Secretary of State's
office. Witness said he thought he saw
the hand of a man holding the gun. Wit
ness had never been in Frankfort before
that day and left that afternoon.
On cross examination witness paid he
was a native of London. Kentucky, and
Â¦went to Colorado In 1S71. He was a
barber until last fall, and since then
has been employed by "Woodmen of
the World," a fraternal organization.
Weaver could not remember about the
weather on the day of the shooting and
could not give a good account of his
movements in Frankfort.
Li. W. Hampton, a Republican member
of the 'Legislature from Knox County,
testified this afternoon that he was talk
ing with Governor Taylor In January on
the subject cf the contest. Witness said
that Taylor told him that human life
would have to be sacrificed. Hampton
continued:
"I replied: 'Well, If the Governor
save " but he broke In and said to me:
'Oh. I can't advise you.' I called on the
Governor to advise him to call oxit the
militia. He told me something would
have to be done before he could do this.
It was in this connection that he spoke of
sacrificing human life."
On the day after the contest board was
drawn, witness heard that Taylor was
abusing the Republican members. He
went to the executive office and Taylor
said to him: "You fellows .Â«at over there
and allowed me to be robbed."
Hampton also said he was in frequent
conference with Caleb Powers and asked
the latter if he did not have a chance to
hold on to his office even If Taylor should
be unseated. Powers replied to witness
that he did not want the. office if Taylor
lost the Governorship as Goebel would
have him assassinated. Powers also told
witness he intended to fight until death
rather than Rive up.- The defense did not
cross-examine the witness.
F. Wharton Golden followed Represent
ative Hampton on the stand.
George Weaver Says He Heard the
Fatal Shot Fired and Saw a Gun
in the Window of the Sec
retary of State's Office.

Will come as a shock to his many friends
in California.
Father Raffo was nearly 80 years old
when death called, but in spite of his ad
â¢ vanced age, none of his faculties was in
the slightest degree dimmed, and in his

Father Raffo was a native of Genoa,
where he was born in 1S21. He studied in
the schools of the Barnabitos until he was
IS years old, when he entered the Society
of Jesus. After a few years his talents
earned him the chair of rhetoric in sev

// \\ ROGERS is at last in Jail. Police
jj- â^\ Judge Caisaniss sent him there
It VV yesterday afternoon, because he
persisted in refusing to answer
questions put to him by the District At
torney, after he had been sworn as a wit
ness against John M. Chretien, on trial
fur forgery. The court gave Rogers
ample opportunity to establish legal
grounds for his refusal. !ist?nir:tr for near
ly an hour to his argument and authori
ties. The attorney raved pbout his con
stitutional rights an.i paired the air in
his efforts to make an impression on the
court. But it old not go. Judge Cabaniss
Insisted that Rogers answer the question
Â«-r go to <ail until he was ready to
answer it.
Rogers chose to go to jail, expecting,
perhaps, t<t be released at once on habeas
corpus, but when last seen he was look-
Ing through the bars.
After ah. no one was surprised or dis
appointed over the outcome. Rogers
m j<- the whole aff;iir as dramatic as pos
sible, and then, when the court adjudged
him guilty of contempt, turned to the
newFpaper artists with a grin and told
them t<Â» "make good pictures. " Despite
the- fact that he had been pleading as an
excuse that even to admit that he was a
lawyer might tend to incriminate him, be
cause of his relations with Chretien and
others in the attt-rripteil looting of the
estate of Joseph Sullivan, he held his hea/1
high and Eeenaed* to think himself the
hero of the rlay.
Judge Â«;abaniss took up the Chretien
case at \\ o'clock yesterday morning. A
new complaint was filed against th<- dis
graced attorney charging him with
forgery. Attorney W. H. Barnes ap
peared for the accused man, assisted by
Attorneys I'erry and Curtis. District At
torney Hyington- conducted the prosecu
tion, assisted by Deputy James Hanley.
The court room B*as crowded, many â¢ at
torneys l>eing present. Chretir-n entered
the courtroom smiling, and nodded to a
number of acquaintances.
."It is not material to this question," ho
paid, "whether the witness is or is not be
fore the Grand Jury. The law read is not
applicable to this case.. This examination
has not proceeded far enough to place the
When court reconvened in Judge Mo
gan's courtroom after lunch Rogers was
at the bar .with a pile of law books and
immediately plunged into a. lengthy argu
ment. The District Attorney frequently
attempted to interrupt him with n look of
disgust on his face. Finally Judge"Ca
baniss did stop the torrent of words.
Judge Cabaniss finally interrupted the
speaker with a demand for authorities,
which Rogers promised to furnish after
the noon recess.
"The whole thing is summed up in this,"
said Byington: "That the court must be
the judge as to whether the answer to a
question would Incriminate a witness. If
it were left to the witness to judge the
wheels of Justice would quickly * be
stopped."
"What has become of the Chretien
case?" said Barnes as the court adjourned
for the noon recess.
The witness then struck a more dra
matic attitude and shouting and swinging
his arms entered into a lengthy discussion
of the question, citing cases and quoting
authorities. He said that the Grand Jury
had summoned him to~ an inquiry, nnd
that District Attorney Byington had said
in the newspapers that he would prose
cute him (Rogers) if he could do so.
"You cannot throw me off my guard.
Brother Byington," replied Rogers again.
"We know that there Is nothing In this
but delay," said the District Attorney.
"The whole matter was threshed out in
the Superior Court."
"I deny any such statement." retorted
Rogers, hotly. "I have my rights as a
citizen, even though I am in a predica
ment. I know my rights and am going to
have them."
"Rogers has been studying on this thing
for a month."
"So far as my client is concerned." said
Attorney Barnes, breaking in, "he waives
all rights at this time to any confidence
ho might have reposed In you."
"If you were here as a defendant, Mr.
Rogers," Faid the . court, "your grounds
would be tenable, but unless you have
further and specific objections I will be
obliged to command you Â¦ to answer the
question." â¢
"Permit me to address ' the court." re
plied Rogers. "A witness cannot com
mence an examination and continue it to
a certain point and then refuse to go on.
so I have refused at the outset. That Is
the way that I understand the law."
Judge Cabaniss argued the question at
some length and then said: Â¦ ,
"I decide that you have not reached the
point which would tend to incriminate."
"Your Honor Is In error," -said Rogers.
"It will not take long to get through
with the witness," Interjected Byington.
Waves Chretien's Rights.
R. J. Graf, secretary of the J. J. Rauer
Collection Agency, testified that he had
received the deed and two receipts from
Chretien and had seen him paid for them.
Attorney Barnes did not cross-examine
the witness at all. but after they had con
cluded, moved that their testimony be
stricken out as incompetent and irrele
vant. The motion was denied.
Robert Colthorp. the colored janitor In
the employ of Chretien, was a willing wit
ness. He frankly admitted plgning the
name "John Sullivan" to a number of
papers, at the request of Chretien. He
did nof read the documents; but easily
and positively identified all the signa
tures Witness said that he had never
appeared before Notary Public Lee D.
Craig to acknowledge an instrument. . He
indorsed Rauer's check in a saloon at
Montgomery and Pine streets.- Professor
"Dutchy" was present.
Attorney James .Taylor Rogers was
called and sat down in the witness chair
with an air of superiority and determina
tion.
"What is your name?" asked the Dis
trict Attorney.
"James Taylor Rogers."
"Your occupation?"
"Now. if the. court please." snld Rogers,
half-rising from his chair, "I desire to
make a statement." - Â¦'., -''z 'Â¦ Â¦
"This is no time. for statements," inter
rupted District Attorney Byington.
"Please answer my question."
Rogers got on his feet and faced the
court, raising his voice.
"I object to answering any questions,"
he shouted, "that may be. ask<*d of me for
these reasons: Having been attorney for
heirs in the estate of Joseph S. Sullivan,
deceased, and having had relations of a
confidential nature with J. M. Chretien,
this defendant, and others who have been
accused of various crimes, I claim exemp
tion. I claim exemption under the fifth
amendment to the constitution of the
Vnited States, under section 13. article 1,
of the constitution of California, and un
der section 20C5 of the Code of Civil Pro
eedure, all of which provide that a man
cannot be compelled to testify to that
which might tend to Incriminate him."
Graf Received the Desd.
The deed, receipts, powpr of attorney
and several other documents, admitted
by the defendant to be forged, were
placed in evidence. One of these was an
instrument purportir.fr to ' be an assign

transaction to be straight. Sine? then he
has been convinced that no such . person

Troutt's court when Chretien made his
celebrated conff^rlon.
"Cbroticn said his client wanted to
sell," Rauer testified, "and I had my
lawyer look into the matter.' My lawyer
reported favorably, and I made a dicker
with Chretien; whereby I gave him a
check for $7.Vi for an alignment of John
Sullivan's Interest. The check Â¦was made
payable to John Sullivan. That was on
May 4. Next day my clerk received a
deed to the property and duplicate re
ceipts, and the check was paid at the
bank, being indorsc-d "John Sullivan' and
â¢J. M. Chretifn.' "
J. J. Raufr, collector and money lender,
who bought from John Chretien the
worthless deod and assignment that pre
tended to give him title to the saving?
of Joseph Sullivan, dweased, was the
lirpt witness called. He repeated the
already familiar story of the transaction
by which Chretien secured gold from him
for forged and worthless papers. It was
on April 25 that Chretien first showed to
him his :>ower of attorney from the
fictitious "John Sullivan" and talked
about selling the estate.

"Nor do I very much care," said the
court.
At this point Attorney Ropers asked to
be excused until ho snould be needed,
agreeing to answer a telephone call with

objected to him leaving the room, so he
was compelled to stand by and hear the
evidence.
P. W. Smith, the official stenographer,

it was so ordered.
"We expeot the tpsclmony of this wit

our tlffense shall be."
Judge Cabaniss was obdurate, however.
He ordercJ Rogers 'nto immediate cus

have a commitment drawn.
Attorney Hamcs asked that further tak
ing of testimony be suspended.
"1 nsk as a citizen.." pleaded Rogers,
"and as an attorney who has had an hon
orable record up to this time that the
court grant me Â¦â¢my liberty until the
higher courts decide this matter."
Judge Cabaniss replied that he would
have to consider witness in contempt and
would have to order him into custody, to
remain in custody until ho consented to
answer the questions as ordered by the
court.
"I want to say to the court," he paid,
"that this whole matter is now before

alents.
To meet the popular demand of large
business houses a one year's course of
study consisting of bookkeeping, business
arithmetic. stenography. typewriting.
English and commercial correspondence,
commercial law, commercial geography.
Spanish and penmanship has been pre
scribed. The aim of this course is to fit
young men and woman for actual busi
ness by giving them a thorough business
education. On admission to the school
each pupil will at once enter on a course
of actual business as carried on in busi
ness houses.
A special course has been provided for
the graduates of the several high schools
and those pupils who were taking the
commercial work In the Polytechnic High
School. The continuation of their studies
for a period of six months will enable
them to graduate and receive a diploma
for the lull course.
COMMERCIAL SCHOOL IS

There was nothing done in the Chretien
case yesterday by the Grand Jury. It
will meet again next Friday afternoon.
The Grand Jury spent most of the after
noon, while waiting to see if Rogers
would llnd time to come before It, in dis
cussing the question of finances. The
jury Is likely to tind the financial ques
tion an interesting one, for the old rule
of unlimited funds has been done away
with and instead the two Grand Juries
for the year have Bet aside for them $2000.
With the J10OO that will be the share of
the present Grand Jury it can do but
little more than pay the stenographer
and a few minor expenses, and the chance
for employing an expert Is very limited
indeed. It was decided, however, that it
was best to ro ahead on an allotment of
a certain sum each month, on what cases
come before it, and then if there be any
extra investigations, to try to find some
assistance from the Supervisors. â¢

th J i I s ? J& e Â°P l ?> lon of the Grand Jury that
the right of Rogers to refuse to answer
question can be settled by an appeal
"P?. n tne contempt proceedings in the
f ollc e Court, and so it is not necessary
f, .n i? t ury L to s Â° fal *ther into the case
until it has been determined whether or
not it can. The contempt before the
Grand Jury and that before the court is
the same, and so the weight of his refusal
ma , v as well be determined through the
Police Court. The Grand Jury has not
ilnished with his case, however, and as
soon as the contempt case has been final
ly decided It will take the matter ud
again.
When the time for the meeting of the
Grand Jury arrived yesterday afternoon.
Rogers was before the Police Court, and
so District Attorney Byington came up
to make his excuses for him and ask the
Grand Jury to put his case over for
awhile.

tnat the State's case was complete except
